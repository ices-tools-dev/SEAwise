Recent evidence shows that the incentives that arise from these systems can improve fisheries sustainability. Although research on TURFs has increased in recent years, important questions regarding the social and ecological dynamics underlying their success remain largely unanswered. In particular, in order to create new successful TURFs, it is critical to comprehend how fish movement over different distances affects the development of sustainable fishing practices within a TURF. In theory, excessive spillover outside a TURF will generate incentives to overharvest. However, many TURFs have proven successful even when targeted species move over distances far greater than the TURF's size. A common attribute among some of these successful systems is the presence of inter-TURF cooperation arrangements. This raises the question of how different levels and types of cooperation affect the motivations for overharvesting driven by the movement of fish outside the TURF. In this paper, we examine equilibrium yields under different levels of inter-TURF cooperation (from partial to full) and varying degrees of asymmetry across TURFs of both biological capacity and benefit-sharing. We find that partial cooperation can improve yields even with an unequal distribution of shared benefits and asymmetric carrying capacity. However, cooperation arrangements are unstable if the sharing agreement and biological asymmetries are misaligned.

Such complexity creates difficulties for managers trying to conserve populations across large areas. This study develops, applies, and tests the use of stochastic life-history modeling and Monte Carlo simulation to assess management scenarios related to the realities of regional fisheries management and conservation. We apply this approach to the management of recreational brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) fishing; an activity that can severely impact species balance, abundance, and the size structure of fish communities. Specifically, the model incorporates population-specific life-history information (e.g., growth rate, reproductive effort, and survival) to allow forecasts of the impact of various management strategies and/or changes to environmental conditions on a population's ecological characteristics (e.g., size structure, abundance, and probability of persistence). Sampling was carried out in 16 water bodies spread across four sites in Atlantic Canada. Each water body was sampled in 2005 and reassessed in 2008. This sampling had two primary objectives: (1) define a significant proportion of life-history variation of brook trout in Atlantic Canada, and (2) to test the precision and accuracy of model predictions of population responses to experimental exploitation and management changes. The model successfully predicted population responses to changes in adult survival in 12 of 13 populations having sufficient data for validation testing, while also proving to be a useful tool when engaging stakeholders regarding management options and their associated risk. We suggest that such models are cost-effective and have great potential for informing proactive management of jurisdictions with numerous and diverse populations.",English,Article,,WOS,Not relevant to marine ecosystem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_0009,Damalas,"Adebola, T; de Mutsert, K",Compartive network analyses for Nigerian coastal waters using two ecopath models developed for the years 1985 and 2000,2019,FISHERIES RESEARCH,213,,33,41,10.1016/j.fishres.2018.12.028,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2018.12.028,"In the late 1990s, depletion of Pink Shrimp (Penaeus notialis) in Nigerian coastal waters (NCW) resulted in increased exploitation of Brown Shrimp (Penaeus monodon), and in spatial redistribution of fishing effort for coastal shrimp fisheries in Nigeria.

This study investigates the hypothesis that ecosystem impacts increased as industrial fleets increased fishing in shallower areas of the Nigerian coast by comparing the state of the ecosystem before and 20 yr after commercial shrimping commenced in Nigerian coastal waters (NCW). Two fishing scenarios were developed in Ecospace, the spatial modeling module of Ecopath with Ecosim software (Ecopath with Ecosim is a mass balanced trophic model that accounts for fishing impacts on food webs), with one having trawlers fishing everywhere beginning at the turn of the century (year 2000) and the other with no trawling in the first 5 nautical miles off the Nigerian coast through the entire period of model simulation (1985-2004). Modeling results showed increases in catch for some fisheries during the study period. In addition, estimated biomass for some functional groups increased especially for Small Pelagic fishes along with Rays, Reef fishes, Large Pelagics, and shallow water shrimps. All other exploited species in our modeling scenarios were estimated to have declining biomasses. Our expectation that redistribution of fishing effort in NCW will increase negative impacts of fishing the nearshore ecosystem was not supported by model results. This counterintuitive result may be because fishing effort on average was mostly distributed in the deeper areas of the inshore waters.

Using the assembled dataset, dynamics of the 1950-based simulations are fitted to agree with observations over 50 years to 2000 through the manipulation of trophic flow parameters and the addition of climate factors: a primary production anomaly and herring recruitment anomaly.

We consider MPA managers with ecological conservation goals and with economic goals, and identify the shortcomings of several common manager decision rules, including those focused on: (1) fishery outcomes rather than broader economic goals, (2) fish stocks at MPA sites rather than across the full marinescape, (3) absolute levels rather than additional values, and (4) costless enforcement.

Length limits modeled were 254 mm for white crappie Pomoxis annularis and 305, 356, and 457 mm for largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides. Simulations were conducted at recruitment variation (coefficient of variation, CV = 100 ? SD/mean) of 20-100% for age-1 recruits. We evaluated how population density, population biomass, total catch (fish harvested and released), yield, and proportional stock density (PSD) would differ in response to a single 3-year or 5-year length limit evaluation. For white crappies, simulations suggested that a 254-mm length limit would not provide detectable differences (P > 0.10) in any population parameter if recruitment variability exceeded 90% for either evaluation period. Mean CV in recruits to age 0 or age 1 for empirical white crappie populations was 82% (range = 55-124, N = 14). Simulations revealed that largemouth bass populations would not exhibit detectable differences unless recruitment variability was 40% or less for a 305-mm length limit and 65% or less for a 356-mm length limit. Values of CV in recruits to age 0 or age 1 for largemouth bass populations averaged 66% (range = 11-189, N = 13). A 457-mm length limit for largemouth bass provided detectable differences in total biomass and PSD up to recruitment variabilities of 100%. Detectable differences were more likely under 5-year evaluations than 3-year evaluations. Proportional stock density was the variable most likely to change in response to the size limit for both white crappies and largemouth bass.

A change in one component would invariably have an effect on others. Stomatopods (mantis shrimps) are common and ecologically important predatory crustaceans in tropical marine waters. The ecological role of mantis shrimps and potential impacts of trawling in a marine ecosystem were estimated using Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) Version 5.0 software, by constructing a mass balanced Ecopath model of Parangipettai (Porto Novo) ecosystem. Based on fisheries information from the region, 17 ecological groups were defined including stomatopods. Both primary and secondary data on biomass, P/B, Q/B and diet composition were used as basic inputs. The mass balanced model gave a total system throughput of 14,756 t km(-2) year(-1). The gross efficiency of 0.000942 indicated higher contribution of lower food chain groups in the fishery though the mean trophic level was 3.08. The immature and developing stage of the ecosystem was indicated by the ratio of total primary production and total respiration (1.832) and the net system production (2643.30 t km(-2) year(-1)). Key indices (flow to detritus, net efficiency and omnivory index), split mortality rates and mixed trophic impact of different ecological groups were obtained from the model. A flow diagram was constructed to illustrate the trophic interactions, which explained the biomass flows in the ecosystem with reference to stomatopods. Two temporal simulations were made, with 10 year durations in the mass balanced Ecopath model by using ecosim routine incorporated in EwE software. The effect of decrease in biomass of stomatopods in the ecosystem was well defined, in the first run with increase in stomatopod fishing mortality, and the group showed a high positive impact on benthopelagic fish biomass increase (129%). The simulation with increase in trawling efforts resulted in the biomass decline of different ecological groups as elasmobranchs to 1%, stomatopods to 2%, crabs and lobsters to 36%, cephalopods to 63%, mackerel to 78%, and shrimps to 89%. Present study warns stomatopod discards and further increase in trawling efforts in the region and it explained the need for ecosystem based fisheries management practices for the sustainability of marine fisheries.

It is a condition exacerbated by the fishing fleet overcapacity and consequent exploitation of the herring stock at a level believed to be unsustainable. Some sources of uncertainty are mainly related to biology and fishing technique: the unsolved problem of herring assessment and management units, the recruitment-environment relationship and the reduction in mean weights-at-age, uncertain ageing of fish, the problem of unaccounted fishing mortality caused by the fish selection through the trawl net. Fishing fleet overcapacity is believed to be behind of the regulatory overfishing when setting the Total Allowable Catches (TACs) higher than the scientific advice (decision overfishing) and tolerating the extensive underreporting of catches (implementation overfishing). Two scenarios for the Central Baltic Sea herring fishery management options are constructed and the Bayesian networks are used to represent and update uncertainties encountered in the process of the management related situation assessment. First scenario represents the current status of the fishery management resulting in fishing mortality (F) higher than FMSY - the fishing mortality that corresponds to the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY).

We have used an Ecopath-with-Ecosim model to predict the impacts of lionfish invasion on a coral reef community based on pre-invasion fish community data. Forty-six groups were defined, and an initial Ecopath model was balanced with a near-zero biomass of lionfish. In Ecosim, the near-zero biomass was eradicated by applying a very high fishing pressure in the first year of simulation. We subsequently (re-)introduced lionfish with a very low biomass, and allowed them to increase to very high abundance. With a near-zero lionfish biomass, the great majority of mesocarnivorous/omnivorous coral reef fish were predicted to be dominant while sharks were predicted to be the apex predators. Different management scenarios were established in the ecosystem to explore the eradication and resilience of lionfish. The management scenarios showed that if all adult lionfish were exploitable it will in theory be possible to fish the lionfish to a very low level, but the fishing pressure will have to be maintained, or the lionfish will recover.

The most significant results include: partition of production was always lowest for the unprotected reef slope; net primary production was three times higher for the semi-protected slopes than for the unprotected one; total catch in the unprotected reef slope was three and eight times higher than the two semi-protected reef slopes; food chain length increased as total catch increased; the calculated trophic level of the catch was relatively lower in the unprotected reef slope; and catch per net primary production (gross efficiency) was higher in the unprotected reef slope than the semi-protected reef slopes. It is concluded that trophic macrodescriptors can serve as a guide to the hard-to-detect negative effects of coral reef management, aid in decision-making, and emphasize the effects that structural descriptors, (e.g. total fish biomass, diversity indices) do not detect. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The sharing of resources between different vessel groups is often left for political decision making. None-theless, such decisions may have both biological and economic consequences. This becomes quite clear when different harvesting groups exploit different sections (age groups) of a stock that has intra-stock interactions in the form of cannibalism. A two-agent bioeconomic model with cannibalism is developed and used to determine (i) optimal annual harvest sizes (TACs) for cod, and (ii) the optimal proportion of the TAC that should be harvested by the different vessel groups in the fishery. Applying biological and economic data in a numerical procedure, and comparing the results obtained to previous studies, it is shown that intra-stock interactions such as the presence of cannibalism has a significant impact on who should take what proportion of the TAC, and hence, the standing stock size and discounted economic rent achievable. In contrast to other studies, we find that the optimal harvest requires that both trawlers and coastal vessels should harvest the fish resource.

However, the net present value of the fisheries is increased by implementing a time-area closure as part of a broader commitment to rebuild the heavily depleted bluefin population, provided the discount rate and the costs of such a closure in forgone fishing opportunities are not too large.

A shrimp fishery, which is not permitted to expand, also operates. We analyzed various harvesting strategies with the Ecopath with Ecosim modelling software, using catch-and-effort data for target species to fit simulated biomasses. Optimal harvesting strategies for artisanal fisheries were explored using social, economic and ecological criteria. Several harvesting strategies were simulated: continuation of the current state of the fisheries, optimizing economic and social (employment) criteria, using maximum sustainable yield (MSY) as a goal of management, and optimization of an ecological criterion when necessary. Optimization of current fisheries and economic and social criteria, and the MSY resulted in depletion of some stocks and in no-realistic increases in fishing effort. Combinations of economic-ecological, social-ecological and economic-social-ecological criteria did not result in stock depletion. However, some of these scenarios resulted in unrealistic choices, especially large increases in gillnet fishing effort. Among the reasonable choices, a strategy of increasing the hook-and-line fishery effort by a factor of 1.5 and the gillnet effort by a factor of 2.8, appeared to be potentially applicable, to increase efficiency of the artisanal fisheries.

In the early 1970s, fishery yields peaked at about 27,000 t per year, of which the pink shrimp was 90%. At present, yields are around 3000 t per year, and pink shrimp contributes less than 1000 t of this. Several studies indicate the main cause is a continually decreasing recruitment rate over the last nearly 30 years, but particularly since the mid-1980s. Single species models cannot predict stock recovery: the best estimate indicates a recovery of almost 20% assuming a closure of 10 years and the current stable stock. An ecosystem approach, based on Ecopath with Ecosim software, is applied to explore harvesting strategies aimed at recovery of shrimp stock, and based on fleet control. To this end, an improved Ecopath mass-balanced model of the southern Gulf of Mexico ecosystem was used for simulations based on Ecosim. A time series of 25 years of biomass and fishing rate data for the pink shrimp, from an age-structured model, was used to calibrate previous model simulations. We also used monthly recruitment for the same period, and changes in vulnerability to predation as forcing factors. At this stage, the model fits independent data well. Harvesting strategies were simulated using different combinations of weighting factors for optimized criteria. These criteria included: net rent, jobs, mandate rebuilding shrimp stock, and conservation of ecosystem structure. Eighteen realistic outputs were obtained after simulations, but all of them resulted in similar conclusions (CV < 7% among all cases). Results indicate that harvested shrimp could be 40% larger than the current size with specific control of fishing fleets. Shrimp fishing mortalities should be reduced by 63.7%, and those of traditional fleets based on hook-and-line, targeting demersal and pelagic fish, by 26.7% and 3.8%, respectively. Fishing mortality of the beach seine and octopus fleets should be increased by 13.6% and 56.5%, respectively. With this scenario, economic and social criteria are strongly and negatively impacted, while the ecological criterion indicates ecosystem structure can remain at least.

The revenue from the fishing exhibits substantial intra-annual variation and carries a significant degree of risk due to the presence of intrinsic volatilities in the marine environment, such as seasonal fluctuations in stock size and constant changes in market conditions over the course of a year. In the face of volatile revenue, fishers may allocate fishing effort and use a quota portfolio to minimize revenue risk. However, decisions underlying effort allocation, such as when to fish what and how much to harvest to match the catch size and remaining quota, are challenging. In this regard, a decision-making framework based on a bio-economic model is used to explore the revenue risk minimization behavior of the Norwegian codfish trawl fleet targeting three different species (cod, saithe, and haddock), given the constraints set by the quotas. The study comprises trawl catches and fishing effort as well as the prices for the frozen products of codfish to investigate the adopted harvest strategy under two different scenarios. The results indicate that a risk-minimizing strategy leads to inefficient allocation of fishing quotas and fishing effort and that potential economic losses from minimizing revenue risk outweigh the benefits. Moreover, our findings prove that enhancing revenue is more important than minimizing revenue risk for the trawlers. We argue that the spatial and temporal freedom of the trawl vessels, together with a vertically integrated trawl industry, may explain the prioritization of revenue enhancement over revenue risk minimization.

We explored one such data-limited system, the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Bight, a river-influenced bight on the east coast of South Africa. Potential system states of the KZN Bight were created by constructing multiple models in Ecopath with Ecosim, carrying out sensitivity analyses and comparing outputs. Sensitivity analyses showed that models were most sensitive to apex predator parameters and a comparison of outputs showed the important influence of riverine detritus on system functioning. To demonstrate the KZN Bight models could reproduce known differences to other ecosystems a comparison of the nutrient-poor KZN Bight to the nutrient-rich Southern Benguela was carried out. This confirmed that the KZN Bight was considerably smaller in biomass, productivity and fishery landings than the Southern Benguela with the systems being detritus-driven and phytoplankton-driven respectively. The KZN Bight relied on large detritus imports from rivers and had higher cycling through the system. The reliance on detritus import from rivers has riverine and fishery management implications as a decrease in riverine detritus caused a decrease in biomass of biotic groups, including targeted fishery species. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,,Scopus,Not relevant to fisheries management evaluation models,"The KwaZulu-Natal

However, the impact of MPAs may vary according to the type of fisheries. In Senegal, the sardinella fishery accounts for 70% of total catches. This fishery is of crucial importance for national food security and employment. Given this importance, it is necessary to evaluate the impact of MPAs, often being considered as a tool for fisheries management. An analytical, dynamic and spatial bio-economic model of sardinella fishery, considering fish and fisher migration, has been developed and scenarios over forty years have been analyzed. The results show that the fishery is economically overexploited and that Senegal could lose about 11.6 billion CFA over forty years of exploitation, i.e. 290 million CFA per year. To achieve an optimal level of exploitation, it would be necessary to halve the current fishing capacity. Implementing MPAs for 10, 20 and 30% of the Senegalese exclusive economic zone lead to slight increases in biomass (1%) and rent (5-11%). In addition, spatio-temporal closures can lead to increased exploitation in unclosed areas, due to the absence of enforcement. Achieving target 11 of the Aichi Convention, i.e., 10% of coastal and marine areas protected per country, will have a reserve effect on the resource but also only lead to weak improvements in economic indicators for the Senegalese fishery.

For mobile species such as fish, knowledge of the scale and variation in movement is central to key planning decisions, such as the size and shape of marine reserves and the interpretation of the response of protected populations. For example, populations of species that require large areas of habitat may not show increases in abundance inside small reserves, but calculating optimal reserve size is complicated by individual variations in behaviour. Fish movements can be used to quantitatively inform marine reserve planning and assessment. An individual based numerical simulation model including acoustic telemetry and census data was used to simulate changes in populations of snapper Pagrus auratus in north-eastern New Zealand. Four behavioural categories and offshore migration were used to represent the observed variability in movement. Age-structures of modelled fish populations in fully exploited areas, marine reserves and virgin populations differed substantially. However, the population structure within reserves resembled a fully fished population more closely than an unfished population. Due to the range of movement types shown by snapper, fish were not 'locked up' by reserves, and fish with centres of activity based in reserves were predicted to have a relatively high chance of being caught outside these reserves. Furthermore, the model showed that the response of fish populations within marine reserves was dependent on levels of exploitation in fished areas. For snapper in coastal reef areas, reserves c. 40 km2 or more may be required to achieve abundances > 50% of the unfished stock. On balance, while marine reserves with sizes similar to Leigh and Tawharanui (c. 5 km2) can achieve significant levels of protection for snapper, they are too small to fully protect resident reserve snapper populations. © Copyright Foundation for Environmental Conservation 2012.",English,Article,,Scopus,,New Zealand,Australia,"10,000-50,000",multidecadal,50-100,year,Simulated dynamics,2,2,3,,,Task 6.2 - climatic and ecological effects on the impact of fisheries management,Other (Individual-nased model),IBM,Single stock,snapper,Biomass aggregated,Fleet not considered,,No,Spatially explicit,No,,Spatial management ,,Biological,Abundance per recruit,no,NOT RELEVANT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_0081,Thorpe,"Bacalso, RTM; Wolff, M; Rosales, RM; Armada, NB","Effort reallocation of illegal fishing operations: A profitable scenario for the municipal fisheries of Danajon Bank, Central Philippines",2016,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,331,,5,16,10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2016.01.015,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2016.01.015,"The northern section of the Danajon Bank, which is located in the Central Visayas islands of the Philippines is a shallow, tropical reef system that supports a multi-species fishery that is primarily artisanal and subsistence in nature. A persisting management and regulatory challenge in the area is the continued use of illegal fishing gears that are deemed destructive by either their manner of operation or technical design. In this study, we used a dynamic simulation model - Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) to explore the potential biological and socio-economic consequences of a hypothetical successful ban on the illegal fisheries in the area under two main scenarios: without fishing effort reallocation and with fishing effort reallocation. The highlight of the study relates to the profit-income analysis whereby the calculated increases in harvestable group biomasses did not necessarily translate into expected increases in overall yields and profits, but showed noteworthy impacts at the per capita level of specific fishing operations. The magnitude and direction of profit income changes varied for the two scenarios. All in all, the removal of illegal fisheries can be a profitable endeavor without necessarily having to sacrifice fisheries jobs through a reallocation of displaced illegal fishers to the legal fishery types. By doing so, the weighted average per capita net profit income in the Danajon municipal fisheries could be increased substantially (38%) compared to the present day reference level. To operationalize the fishing effort reallocation, we advocate the use of the fisheries licensing system that is already in place and to translate our findings into numbers of fishing license quantities to be allocated among the allowable fishery gear types. To conclude, the use of a per capita yield and profit incomes analysis provides relevant, objective, and practical policy advice for the management of small-scale and subsistence fisheries where alternative livelihood options may be limited.

Using data on sea-surface temperature anomalies, the impacts of climate on the conservation and the welfare that can be extracted from the stock are investigated. Results indicate that an informed management policy leads to stock biomass and resource rents that are up to 2.7 and 2 times higher, respectively, than under an uninformed policy. Also, the fishery is open 54Ê% longer under the informed policy.

This spatialized dynamic model links the coupled hydrodynamic and biogeochemical model Eco3-MS/SYMPHONIE (LTL - low trophic level model) to OSMOSE (HTL - high trophic level model). It includes 15 compartments of living organisms, five from the LTL model (ie. nanophytoplankton, microphytoplankton, nanozooplankton, microzooplankton and mesozooplankton) and ten from the HTL model (northern krill, southern shortfin squid, European pilchard, European anchovy, European sprat, Atlantic horse mackerel, Atlantic mackerel, blue whiting, European hake and Atlantic bluefin tuna). With the exception of northern krill and European sprat, all HTL species are commercially exploited and undergo fisheries mortality pressure. The modeled species represent more than 70% of annual catches in this area. This paper presents the parameterization, calibration and evaluation of this model with satellite data for phytoplankton and with biomass, landings, diet and trophic level data for HTL groups. For most species, the diets in output of OSMOSE-GoL are similar to field and literature data in terms of dominant prey groups and species. However, some differences were observed. Various reasons may explain the mismatch between the modeled diet and field data. Benthic prey sometimes observed in the stomach content of the HTL predators were not modeled in OSMOSE-GoL. Field studies were carried out at specific periods and locations, while our data concern the period 2001-2004 and the entire modeled domain. Inter- and intra-annual variations in spatial distribution and density of prey may also explain these differences. The model estimates trophic level values similar to those cited in the literature for all the HTL compartments. These values are also close to the trophic levels estimated by a previous Ecopath model for the same area and period.

This detailed documentation of the fishing practices is used in spatial modelling tools to improve advice and research for fisheries. The tools integrate detailed information on vessel distribution, catch and fuel consumption for different fisheries with a detailed resource distribution of targeted stocks from research surveys to evaluate the optimum consumption and efficiency to reduce fuel costs and the costs of displacement of effort. The energy efficiency for the value of catch per unit of fuel consumed is analysed by merging the questionnaire, logbook and VMS (vessel monitoring system) information. Logic decision trees and conditional behaviour probabilities are established from the responses of fishermen regarding a range of sequential hypothetical conditions influencing their trip decisions, covering the duration of fishing time, choice of fishing ground(s), when to stop fishing and return to port, and the choice of the port for landing. Fleet-based energy and economy efficiency are linked to the decision (choice) dynamics. Larger fuel-intensive but efficient vessels conducting pelagic or industrial fishing are more inclined to base their decision on fish price only, while numerous smaller and less efficient vessels conducting demersal mixed or crustacean fishery usually consider other flexible factors, e.g., the potential for a large catch, weather, previous knowledge and experience, and the distance to/from port, which affect the number and duration of trips and the fuel consumption. Integration of the results into our recently developed spatially explicit individual-based fishing vessel model (IBM) incorporate the variability and predict the adaptations of individual fishermen to resource availability dynamics, increasing fuel prices, changes in regulations, and the consequences of socioeconomic external pressures on harvested stocks.

More energy-efficient fisheries are also likely to alter existing fishing patterns, which already vary from fishery to fishery and from vessel to vessel. The impact assessment of new spatial plans involving fisheries should be based on quantitative bioeconomic analyses that take into account individual vessel decisions, and trade-offs in cross-sector conflicting interests. We use a vessel-oriented decision-support tool (the DISPLACE model) to combine stochastic variations in spatial fishing activities with harvested resource dynamics in scenario projections. The assessment computes economic and stock status indicators by modelling the activity of Danish, Swedish, and German vessels (> 12 m) in the international western Baltic Sea commercial fishery, together with the underlying size-based distribution dynamics of the main fishery resources of sprat, herring, and cod. The outcomes of alternative scenarios for spatial effort displacement are exemplified by evaluating the fishers's abilities to adapt to spatial plans under various constraints. Interlinked spatial, technical, and biological dynamics of vessels and stocks in the scenarios result in stable profits, which compensate for the additional costs from effort displacement and release pressure on the fish stocks.

More energy-efficient fisheries are also likely to alter existing fishing patterns, which already vary from fishery to fishery and from vessel to vessel. The impact assessment of new spatial plans involving fisheries should be based on quantitative bioeconomic analyses that take into account individual vessel decisions, and trade-offs in cross-sector conflicting interests. We use a vessel-oriented decision-support tool (the DISPLACE model) to combine stochastic variations in spatial fishing activities with harvested resource dynamics in scenario projections. The assessment computes economic and stock status indicators by modelling the activity of Danish, Swedish, and German vessels (> 12 m) in the international western Baltic Sea commercial fishery, together with the underlying size-based distribution dynamics of the main fishery resources of sprat, herring, and cod. The outcomes of alternative scenarios for spatial effort displacement are exemplified by evaluating the fishers's abilities to adapt to spatial plans under various constraints. Interlinked spatial, technical, and biological dynamics of vessels and stocks in the scenarios result in stable profits, which compensate for the additional costs from effort displacement and release pressure on the fish stocks.

The European Commission is considering the imposition of a discard ban to preserve vulnerable and economically important fish stocks. We explored the potential effects of a discard ban in mixed fisheries management using the French mixed fisheries in the Eastern English Channel as a model system. We examined in particular the performance of 2 different management scenarios: (1) individual quota management with a tolerance for discarding and (2) individual quota management in combination with a discard ban, using a dynamic state variable model. The model evaluates a time series of decisions taken by fishers to maximize profits within management constraints. Compliance to management was tested by applying an in-height varying fine for exceeding the quota. We then evaluated the consequences of individual cod quota in both scenarios with respect to over-quota discarding, spatial and temporal effort allocation and switching between metiers. Individual quota management without a discard ban hardly influenced fishers' behaviour as they could fully utilise cod quota and continue fishing other species while discarding cod. In contrast, a discard ban forced fishers to reallocate effort to areas and weeks in which cod catch is low, at the expense of lower revenue. In general, a restrictive policy for individual quota for cod needs to be combined with a discard ban and a high fine (>20 times the sale price) to reduce over-quota discarding.",English,Article,"Green Published, Green Submitted",WOS,,Eastern English Channel,Europe,">100,000",five year,"50,000-100,000",year,Simulated dynamics,2,2,3,"Our spatially explicit effort-allocation model proves to be a useful tool to evaluate conservation and economic tradeoffs and enables managers to visualize consequences of new management scenarios, such as a discard ban.",The potential effects of a discard ban in mixed fisheries management using the French mixed fisheries in the Eastern English Channel as a model system,Task 6.5 - management strategies,Other (dynamic state variable modelling (DSVM)),Other (dynamic state variable modelling (DSVM)),Multi-stock (without species interactions),Plaice_sole_cod_whiting_Atlantic mackerel_mullet,Biomass aggregated,multi-fleet/metier,French otter trawl fleet (demersal) and netting fleet.,Yes,Spatially explicit,No,,Output control ,No,Economic,Effort_net revenue,no,,"In general, a restrictive policy for individual quota for cod needs to be combined with a discard ban and a high fine (>20 times the sale price) to reduce over-quota discarding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_0096,Depestele,"Baudron, A; Ulrich, C; Nielsen, JR; Boje, J",Comparative evaluation of a mixed-fisheries effort-management system based on the Faroe Islands example,2010,ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE,67,5,1036,1050,10.1093/icesjms/fsp284,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsp284,"Total allowable catch (TAC) management has in many fisheries, especially mixed fisheries, failed to meet conservation objectives.

Therefore, in 1996, an effort-regulation system with individual transferable effort quotas was introduced to manage the fisheries. Experience has shown that effort management without additional stock-specific measures may not be appropriate for such fisheries. A management strategy evaluation model was developed to compare an effort-management system based on the Faroese example with a TAC system as currently applied in EU fisheries. Results show that when stocks are considered in isolation, a total allowable effort system does not necessarily perform better than a TAC one. It depends on stock status and dynamics, the level of uncertainty, and the reactivity of the system to changes in scientific advice.

We use a spatial ecosystem model, forced by a coupled physical-biogeochemical model, to simulate the spatial distribution of functional groups within a marine ecosystem, which depends on their respective tolerances to abiotic factors, trophic interactions, and fishing. We simulate the future long-term spatial developments of the community composition and their potential implications for fisheries under three different nutrient management scenarios and changing climate. The three nutrient management scenarios result in contrasting developments of bottom oxygen concentrations and phytoplankton abundance, with substantial effects on fish production. Nutrient load reduction increases the spatial extent of the areas suitable for the commercially most valuable demersal fish predator and all types of fisheries. This suggests that strategic planning of fishery management strategies could benefit from considering future changes in species distributions due to changes in eutrophication. We show that combining approaches from climate research, physical oceanography, biogeochemistry, biogeography, and trophic ecology with economical information provides a strong foundation to produce scientific knowledge that can support a multisectoral management of ecosystems. © International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2018.

We use a spatial ecosystem model, forced by a coupled physical-biogeochemical model, to simulate the spatial distribution of functional groups within a marine ecosystem, which depends on their respective tolerances to abiotic factors, trophic interactions, and fishing. We simulate the future long-term spatial developments of the community composition and their potential implications for fisheries under three different nutrient management scenarios and changing climate. The three nutrient management scenarios result in contrasting developments of bottom oxygen concentrations and phytoplankton abundance, with substantial effects on fish production. Nutrient load reduction increases the spatial extent of the areas suitable for the commercially most valuable demersal fish predator and all types of fisheries. This suggests that strategic planning of fishery management strategies could benefit from considering future changes in species distributions due to changes in eutrophication. We show that combining approaches from climate research, physical oceanography, biogeochemistry, biogeography, and trophic ecology with economical information provides a strong foundation to produce scientific knowledge that can support a multisectoral management of ecosystems. © International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2018.

Such mis-match between the ecological and management scales may lead to a loss of spatial diversity and a restricted ability of populations to adapt and persist in the presence of changing environmental conditions. Developing harvest strategies for spatially complex fish populations therefore remains a major challenge. In this study, we evaluate whether managing spatially complex fish stocks as large-scale aggregates leads to greater conservation risks. We develop a closed-loop simulation model that represents a range of dispersal scenarios and includes imperfect management knowledge about the abundances and dynamics of interacting Pacific herring (. Clupea pallasi) sub-populations, as well as weak management control of how exploitation is allocated among sub-populations. The latter is driven by the spatial dynamics of the fishing fleet as it seeks to optimize profitability. Simulated management outcomes did not always lead to increased risks under all scenarios of dispersal, fishery spatial dynamics, and management errors. Instead, these processes interacted to either mediate or intensify the impact of inappropriate management assumptions and stock assessment errors. Management strategies aimed directly at limiting exploitation risk consistently protected spatially complex populations in the presence of incorrect management assumptions about stock structure, high fishing power, and persistent stock assessment errors. Given the pervasiveness of these errors in fisheries, we recommend further evaluation of spatio-temporal refugia for tactical management of spatially complex fish populations. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,,Scopus,,Strait of Georgia British Columbia,North America,">100,000",multidecadal,"50,000-100,000",year,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey_Fisheries Dependent Data,3,3,3,,,Task 6.2 - climatic and ecological effects on the impact of fisheries management,Other (no name),Other (no name),Multi-stock (without species interactions),Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii),Biomass aggregated,single-fleet /metier,unspecified,Yes,Spatially explicit,No,,Output control ,No,Biological,Depletion of population_Depletion over sub-populations_proportion of sub-populations with depletion below 20%_5th percentile of depletion across all sub-populations,not clear,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_0111,AZTI_Ibaibarriaga,"Bentley, JW; Serpetti, N; Heymans, JJ",Investigating the potential impacts of ocean warming on the Norwegian and Barents Seas ecosystem using a time-dynamic food-web model,2017,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,360,,94,107,10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2017.07.002,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2017.07.002,"Climate change in the Norwegian and Barents (NorBar) Seas is expected to generate major alterations to the marine food-web and its associated uses. However, our current capacity to quantify the potential ecological impact of physical change is hindered by a lack of fundamental knowledge regarding the forces and trophic interactions which have driven historic ecosystem dynamics. Here we used a historic (1950) food web model (Ecopath with Ecosim, EwE) of the NorBar Seas fitted to time series between 1950 and 2014 to simulate ecosystem response to changes in ocean temperature over the next 85 years to 2100 under a range of temperature scenarios including a large scale climate variability indices (Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, AMO). Fishing, top-down/bottom-up trophic interactions, a primary production anomaly and annual ocean temperature were all found to be important drivers of modelled ecosystem dynamics in the NorBar Seas from 1950 to 2014. Under projected temperature scenarios, the biomass of pelagic species, such as mackerel and blue whiting, increased with rising ocean temperature, whereas the biomass of boreal species, such as redfish, prawns and capelin, decreased. Whilst within favourable temperature conditions, cod biomass is predicted to decrease under the warmest scenarios due to the reduced availability of preferred prey and the increased pressure of pelagic predation upon juvenile cod.

Bycatch has become one of the foremost, global issues of fishery managers and conservationists, especially when the non-target species is from a protected or threatened population. However, the impact and spatial distribution of bycatch is frequently unknown making it difficult to develop effective, justifiable mitigation regulations. This challenge is exemplified by the bycatch of river herring (alewife, Alosa pseudoharengus, and blueback herring, A. aestivalis) and American shad (A. sapidissima) in the northwest Atlantic mid-water trawl fishery targeting Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) and Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus). As an alternative to immediate management action, a voluntary bycatch avoidance program was established through an industry, state government, and university partnership. Here the program is described and its impact is evaluated by comparing fleet behavior and bycatch prior to and during the program. The combined results suggest that consistent communication, facilitated by the avoidance program, positively influenced fishing habits and played a role in the approximately 60% decrease in total bycatch and 20% decrease in the bycatch ratio observed during the program. However, the success of small scale move-along strategies to reduce bycatch ratios varied greatly in different areas of the fishery and years. This suggests the program is best viewed as an intermediate or complimentary solution. Overall, this project exemplifies of how collaborative programs can help alleviate difficult management scenarios. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,,Scopus,,Not relevant,Not relevant,">100,000",five year,"5,000-10,000",day,Fisheries Dependent Data,2,2,3,,,Task 6.5 - management strategies,none,none,not specified,,,,,,,,,Spatial management ,Only at a case study level,Biological,Biomass index,no,,Description of a volountary bycatch avoidance program where commercial fishing vessel captains were informed about presence of bycatch.

Management Strategy Evaluation and bioeconomic modeling need data at a specific level of resolution in terms of time, area and type of fishing activity for analyzing measures for management procedures using simulations. Within the Data Collection Framework, data are to be aggregated at different levels, e.g.: fleet segment and mtier, the former linked to the predominant gear and the size of the vessel and the latter to the activity itself. Fishing costs are collected by fleet segment, effort and landings by fleet segment and mtier. Bioeconomic modeling for management purposes requires data at the same resolution. The aim of this paper is to describe a methodology, implemented in SECFISH R package, to disaggregate variable cost data from the fleet segment to the mtier level. The presented tool allows to determine the correlation between the variable costs of a vessel and its activities to estimate costs at the activity level (e.g. mtiers). The tool is applied to selected Italian fleet segments characterized by a variety of mtiers and high dynamicity. Copyright: © 2022 Bitetto et al.

The model is used to analyse alternative management strategies for the Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (RFMO) managing this fishery, and to investigate some of the policy implications. For the various scenarios, the optimal stock level varies between 500-800,000 tonnes, which compares with a stock level of 150,000 tonnes in 1995. In other words, there is a very strong case for rebuilding the stock. Moreover, the sustainability of the stock is threatened unless a recovery programme is implemented; indeed, the alternative may be stock collapse. Second, to rebuild the stock, Draconian measures are called for: either outright moratoria over fairly lengthy periods, or possibly a more gradual approach to steady state given by a Total Allowable Catch (TAC) at a low level for an extended period of time. Third, the cost of inefficient gear structure is very high indeed.

At that time, no information concerning stock structure, distribution and movements of these species was available. Moreover, data on the population biology and on commercial catches were inadequate. Such data are crucial for stock assessment and for managing the stocks. Clearly, if the stocks being fished were shared, joint management would be appropriate. In order to answer the questions related to managing shared stocks, a collaborative research project was initiated by Australia (CSIRO as the lead agency) and Indonesia in 1999. The objectives were firstly, to describe the population dynamics, stock structure and biology of snappers relevant to the management of stocks shared between Australian and Indonesian fisheries; secondly, to characterize the social and financial structures of the Indonesian fishery so they could be taken into account in the development of management strategies; and thirdly, to explore ways of developing complementary management for the long term sustainability of the snapper fisheries. This project finished in 2003 and in this paper we bring together the results of the biological, genetic, population dynamics and socioeconomic research in relation to managing shared stocks in the context of managed versus unmanaged fisheries, small scale and industrial fisheries, and in both developed and developing country regulatory environments.

At that time, no information concerning stock structure, distribution and movements of these species was available. Moreover, data on the population biology and on commercial catches were inadequate. Such data are crucial for stock assessment and for managing the stocks. Clearly, if the stocks being fished were shared, joint management would be appropriate.

For example, in Europe, targets for (i) biodiversity, (ii) food web structure as indicated by the proportion of large fish and (iii) fishing mortality rates for exploited species that lead to maximum sustainable yield, F-MSY,F- are being proposed to support implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Efforts to reconcile any trade-offs among objectives need to be informed by knowledge on the consequences of alternate management actions. We develop, calibrate and apply a multispecies size spectrum model of the North Sea fish community to assess the response of populations and the community to fishing. The model predicts species' size distributions, abundance, productivity and interactions and therefore provides a single framework for evaluating trade-offs between population status, community and food web structure, biodiversity and fisheries yield. We show that the model can replicate realistic fish population and community structure and past responses to fishing. We assess whether meeting management targets for exploited North Sea populations (fishing species at F-MSY) will be sufficient to meet proposed targets for biodiversity and food web indicators under two management scenarios (status quo and F-MSY). The recovery in biodiversity indicators is 60% greater when fishing populations at F-MSY than if status quo (2010) fishing rates are maintained. The probability of achieving a food web target was 60% under both scenarios in spite of major community restructuring revealed by other indicators of community size structure. Synthesis and applications. Our model can be applied to evaluate indicator targets and trade-offs among fisheries and conservation objectives.

In order to quantify ecosystem impacts of integrated climate change and eutrophication pressures under constant high fishing pressure, and to support decision-making and policies in generating environmental and economic sustainable systems, the Baltic Atlantis holistic and mechanistic ecosystem model was applied. The overall aim was to run scenarios of separate and integrated impacts of climate and riverine nutrient load changes, taking into account the interactions of the full food web in the entire Baltic Sea. This was done to identify which of those two pressures will likely dominate the future of the Baltic Sea ecosystem, and to test effects of different riverine nutrient forcing sources as well as the Baltic Atlantis functions in relation to hydrographic spawning thresholds. By integrating the hydrography, the biology covering all trophic levels of the food web, and multiple pressures, i. e. eutrophication, climate change and fishery, we were able to evaluate relative impacts of 3 climate scenarios and 3 nutrient load scenarios, using two sources of nutrient forcing and predict likely trends in ecosystem effects. With focus on major fish stocks, our model, with its assumptions, indicated that nutrient loads are the main driver of the changes in the ecosystem as long as the hydrographic thresholds for spawning are not reached. If the thresholds are reached for the Baltic cod, climate change impact will become most important. Furthermore, higher nutrient loads resulted in cod decrease, and increase in sprat and herring.

This paper presents a cost-benefit analysis of two real case temporary NTZs closed during a 5Ð6 year period in the coastal zone of the Baltic Sea, using scenario analysis to account for uncertainty in both the biological and economic effects. A sensitivity analysis was added for certain key parameters. The results of the cost-benefit analyses for the two NTZs are positive in all scenarios relating to the most realistic case of no opportunity costs, i.e., assuming that all fishing activity could be relocated to adjacent areas without cost during the closed period. As an extreme case comparison, full opportunity costs were included, assuming that no fishing activity could be relocated to other areas during the closed period. One of the NTZs then exhibited a negative net result for most scenarios. For the other area the net result was positive even when the maximum opportunity costs of temporary lost fishing opportunities were included, largely depending on the strong positive change in the value of commercial fishing.

Forecasting the consequences of fishing scenarios has long been a central part of fisheries management. More recently, the effects of changing climate have been simulated alongside the effects of fishing to project their combined consequences for fish stocks. Here, we use an ecological individual-based model (IBM) to make predictions about how the Northeast Atlantic mackerel (NEAM) stock may respond to various fishing and climate scenarios out to 2050. Inputs to the IBM include Sea Surface Temperature (SST), chlorophyll concentration (as a proxy for prey availability) and rates of fishing mortality F at age. The climate scenarios comprise projections of SST and chlorophyll from an earth system model GFDL-ESM-2M under assumptions of high (RCP 2.6) and low (RCP 8.5) climate change mitigation action. Management scenarios comprise different levels of F, ranging from no fishing to rate Flim which represents an undesirable situation for management. In addition to these simple management scenarios, we also implement a hypothetical area closure in the North Sea, with different assumptions about how much fishing mortality is relocated elsewhere when it is closed. Our results suggest that, over the range of scenarios considered, fishing mortality has a larger effect than climate out to 2050. This result is evident in terms of stock size and spatial distribution in the summer months. We then show that the effects of area closures are highly sensitive to assumptions about how fishing mortality is relocated elsewhere after area closures. Going forward it would be useful to incorporate: (1) fishing fleet dynamics so that the behavioral response of fishers to area closures, and to the stock's spatial distribution, can be better accounted for; and (2) additional climate-related stressors such as ocean acidification, deoxygenation and changes in prey composition.",English,Article,"Green Accepted, gold",WOS,,North Sea,Europe,"10,000-50,000",decade,"10,000-50,000",multidecadal,Fisheries Dependent Data,2,1,3,,,Task 6.2 - climatic and ecological effects on the impact of fisheries management,Other (IBM),IBM,Single stock,Northeast Atlantic Mackerel,Age structured,single-fleet /metier,Pelagic,No,Spatially explicit,Yes,not clear,Spatial management ,No,Biological,F_B,yes,RNetLogo,"climate is important, fishing intensity is likely to have a much larger effect on the mackerel

In this study, we identify and quantify the uncertainty associated with the harvested biomass of southern king crab (SKC) (Lithodes santolla), as declared by artisanal fishers of the Magallanes Region, Chile, in order to assess the harvestable biomass under a precautionary (conservative) approach to its exploitation in a scarce information context. This analysis includes the application of (i) fuzzy-Bayesian machine learning to quantify the uncertainty related to the harvested biomass per vessel per fishing cruise (C), and (ii) nonlinear polynomial regression models to project the spatial distribution of C according to the estimated uncertainty limits (minimum and maximum). The uncertainty analysis shows a 2000 kg threshold for C; beyond that, the declared harvest does not follow the estimated relationship between biomass and habitat characteristics (temperature, turbidity). The maps created from this analysis convey crucial information that would allow a more rational exploitation of the SKC stock and could be used to estimate a sustainable fishing quota, i.e., allocating effort according to the harvestable biomass. Our results suggest that the proposed tool can reliably inform management faced with uncertainty in stock exploitation by SSF, particularly when information is scarce. © 2018",English,Article,,Scopus,Not relevant to fisheries management evaluation models,Magallanes region (Chile),Europe,,,,,,,,,,"statistical method to get better estimates of the stock exploitation of southern king krab, not related to fisheries management evaluation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_0157,AZTI_Andres,"Breen, P; Tully, O; Hynes, S; Loughlin, C; Reecht, Y; Morley, T",An integrated methodology for assessing ecological and economic impacts for marine management: A case study for abrasion and mobile fishing gear effects,2020,OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT,198,,,,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.105351,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.105351,"Ensuring a balance of conservation and human activities within the marine environment requires complex decisions on how to achieve conservation objectives whilst considering the likely economic and social costs and benefits of such decisions.

However, little is known about the effect of MPAs on fish assemblages, especially in the presence of different life history and ecological traits. Modelling the observed changes in fish population structures may provide a mechanistic understanding of fish assemblage dynamics. In addition, modelling allows a quantitative estimate of MPA spill-over. To achieve this purpose, we adapted an existing ecosystem model, OSMOSE (Object-oriented simulator of marine biodiversity exploitation), to the specific case of the presence of fish with multiple life histories. The adapted model can manage 4 main categories of life history identified in an estuary MPA: fish that (1) spend their entire life cycle locally, (2) are present only as juveniles, (3) enter the area as juveniles and stay permanently except during reproduction periods, which occur outside the estuary, and (4) are present occasionally and for a short time for foraging purposes. To take into account these specific life-history traits, the OSMOSE code was modified. This modelling approach was developed in the context of the Bamboung Bolong MPA, located in a mangrove area in the Sine-Saloum Delta, Senegal. This was the ideal case to develop our approach as there has been scientific monitoring of the fish population structure inside the MPA before fishery closure, providing a reference state, and continuous monitoring since the closure. Ecologically similar species were pooled by trophic traits into 15 groups that represented 97% of the total biomass. Lower trophic levels (LTL) were represented by 6 compartments. The biomass of the model species was calibrated to reproduce the reference situation before fishery closure. Model predictions of fish assemblage changes after fishery closure corresponding to the Bamboung MPA creation scenario were compared to field observations; in most cases the model reproduces observed changes in biomass (at least in direction). We suggest the existence of a sanctuary effect, that was not taken into account in the model, this could explain the observed increase in biomass of top predators not reproduced by the model. Finally, the annual MPA fish spill-over was estimated at 11 tons (similar to 33% of the fish biomass) from the model output, mainly due to diffusive effects.",English,Article,"Bronze, Green Submitted",WOS,,"Bamboung Bolong MPA, located in a mangrove area in the Sine-Saloum Delta, Senegal",Africa,"5,000-10,000",multidecadal,100-500,month,Fisheries Dependent Data,2,2,2,,OSMOSE model for MPA in Senegal,Task 6.5 - management strategies,Other (specify),Other (specify),Ecosystem model,Sardinella maderensis_Tilapia guineensis_Ilisha africana_other,Length structured,Fleet not considered,"not considered, F is set",No,Spatially explicit,No,,Spatial management ,no,Biological,biomass,yes,Osmose,"Osmose model for a relatively small area, looking into effect of MPA, economic/fleet component not considered, fisheries effects by setting F.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_0169,AZTI_Ibaibarriaga,C.

Annual prey availability can vary more than 10-fold in marine ecosystems, with prey experiencing a dramatic increase or pulse in production within some years. To assess the bottom-up effects of such pulses on predator growth, production, and fisheries management, we developed an age-specific, predator-prey simulation model (parameterized for summer flounder, Paralichthys dentatus) based on simple hypothesized mechanisms for consumption, growth, and population dynamics. Pulses in each of the three modeled prey groups (small crustaceans, forage fish, larger fish prey) generated different magnitudes of change in predator weight-at-age (w), spawning stock biomass (S), fishery yield (Y), and recruitment (R), due to ontogenetic differences in growth potential and dietary composition across predator age classes. Increases in productivity of small forage fishes generated the greatest gains in predator w, S, Y, and R, relative to pulses of the other prey groups. Median increases in R following a prey pulse were minimal (<4%) except under high fishing rates that stimulated a stronger compensatory response in the population (8-11% increase in R), demonstrating the interactive role of top-down and bottom-up effects on predator productivity. Seasonal migration patterns determined the degree of spatiotemporal overlap of predators with the spatially constrained pulses in prey production. Prey pulses reduced the median time required for depleted populations to be rebuilt by 0-5% following declines in fishing pressure. Reductions in time to recovery were highly variable due to recruitment stochasticity, but stock recovery was more sensitive to the severity of harvest control measures than to availability of the non-limiting prey. Understanding the relative magnitudes of such bottom-up processes, particularly in the presence of varied fishing pressure can aid in developing ecosystem approaches to fisheries management that account for such ecological interactions more explicitly.

Bio-economic models are developed to simulate and evaluate the impact of the management systems as they are applied to the following fisheries: Baltic cod (Gadus morhua), North Sea flatfish, Spanish northern hake (Merluccius merluccius), Faroe cod, haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and saithe (Pollachius virens). For each fishery, a number of scenarios are evaluated and ranked according to economic performance measures. The analyses suggest that economic performance is significantly influenced by the type of management system implemented. With respect to participatory governance, it is shown that in the part of the northern hake fishery exploited by Spain, the introduction of participatory governance provides better economic performance in the long-run when compared to the more traditional total allowable catch (TAC) system. With respect to effort-based control, it is shown in both the Faroe and the North Sea cases that rights-based effort control can have both positive and negative implications for economic performance when compared to TAC systems. In the North Sea case, the impact on economic performance is shown to depend on how effort restrictions are set. Finally, it is shown that marine protected areas may influence the economic performance of fisheries negatively in the short and medium term, even though this effort-based control system has a positive influence on recovery of fish stocks. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",English,,,Scopus,Article type,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_0178,Politikos,"Bumbeer, J; da Rocha, RM; Bornatowski, H; Robert, MD; Ainsworth, C",Predicting impacts of lionfish (Pterois volitans) invasion in a coastal ecosystem of southern Brazil,2018,BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,20,5,1257,1274,10.1007/s10530-017-1625-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-017-1625-8,"The opportunistic feeder Pterois volitans is a voracious invader, causing large impacts in marine food-webs. We have used a Ecopath-with-Ecosim model to hypothesize an invasion by lionfish and to predict the likely impact of this potential generalist mesopredator in a subtropical food-web model. With thirty-three functional groups, the initial Ecopath model was balanced with a low biomass of lionfish (0.07 t/km(2)). In Ecosim, three scenarios of different vulnerability settings for the linkages between the introduced fish and its prey were tested, representing the default setting, a top-down control, and an extreme top-down control. The scenarios were tested using different assumptions on the ability of the invasive fish to change the proportions of prey consumed according to prey availability. Our model predicted that the hypothesized lionfish invasion would have a strong impact on this subtropical marine food web: (1) by reducing prey populations and, consequently, food for native predators, and; (2) by predating on key species, causing direct impacts and possibly cascading trophic effects.

However, some adaptations in the fishing strategy of fishermen are expected which may affect other fish groups.

A spatial simulation model is presented that estimates the anticipated improvement in harvest of the Eastern King Prawn fishery in New South Wales, Australia, following potential restoration. By integrating environmental, biological and fisheries information gleaned from previous studies, this model suggests zones with ample larval settlement but greatly diminished habitat for juvenile life stages (recruitment), and that are in close proximity to the main fishery grounds, are likely to provide the greatest anticipated improvements in harvest. Uncertainty analyses demonstrated the particular sensitivity of these outcomes to assumptions of larval dispersal, and zone-specific recruitment at unfished conditions. The work emphasizes the utility of spatial models for restoration planning, but also the dependence of these models on information provided from empirical studies.

To examine determinants of fisher behaviors, this study develops a coupled behavior-economic model examining how physical, market, and regulatory forces affect commercial fishers' choice of fishing grounds in a small-scale fishery (SSF) in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. The model estimates that fishing operations land $396 ± 110 per trip (mean ± 1 SD; n = 427 trips), with the highest value in landings arriving from Lang Bank. The model explains 62% of the variation in fishers' choice to fish at Lang Bank, the most productive, yet farthest fishing grounds. The coupled behavioral-economic model is focused on the small temporal and spatial scales of fishing effort and FEK in an SSF. Therefore the model can be used to predict how a range of physical and regulatory conditions and changes in demand will drive overall (fleet) fishing effort allocation in space and time. By illustrating and quantifying these social-ecological causes and effects, the model can assist managers to efficiently allocate limited monitoring and enforcement resources. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,,Scopus,,"St. Croix, US Virgin Islands",North America,"50,000-100,000",year,"5,000-10,000",day,Fisheries Dependent Data,2,2,2,"""In short, examining and modeling fisher behavior begin to reveal their FEK, which provides a greatly underutilized information source for describing and managing data-limited SSFs, and assessing the effectiveness of those regulations established to achieve fishery goals.""",,Task 6.3 - social and economic effects on the impact of fisheries management,Other (statistical model),Other (statistical model),"Other (None, catch value)",conch_spiney lobster_parrotfish_mahi mahi_other pelagics_snappers,not relevant,single-fleet /metier,small scale,Yes,Spatially implicit,Yes,wind speed_wave height_rainfall,No management measures,No,Economic,Catch value,no,,"Interesting analysis, but less clear how the results would translate to management in reality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_0200,Tsoukali,"Carvalho, PG; Humphries, A",Gear restrictions create conservation and fisheries trade-offs for management,,FISH AND FISHERIES,,,,,10.1111/faf.12607,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/faf.12607,"Gear-based management for coral reef fisheries is often overlooked in the scientific literature. Empirical studies have demonstrated the conservation benefits of gear-restricted areas (i.e. prohibiting fishing gears), which can support greater biomass than unrestricted areas and protect species that play key functional roles. However, population dynamics of functional feeding groups of reef fishes under specific gear-restriction regimes remains uncertain. Here, we constructed a multi-species, length-based fisheries model to observe relative biomass and catch of reef fishes under various gear-restriction management scenarios. We used fishery-dependent and fishery-independent data to determine the catchability of functional groups and selectivity of size classes for hook-and-line, net and spear fishing, which are widely used gear types on coral reefs globally. Our model revealed trade-offs involved with gear-restriction management such that no single management strategy was able to maximize biomass or catch of all functional groups simultaneously. Also, we found that spear fishing (i.e. prohibiting hook-and-line and net fishing) maintained the highest total biomass summed across functional groups, whilst hook-and-line fishing (i.e. prohibiting net and spear fishing) and a ban on spears maintained the lowest biomass. However, hook-and-line fishing generated the highest catch-per-unit-effort. Our model results were primarily driven by differential growth rates, maximum per capita production of recruits, and catchability of functional groups targeted by each fishing gear.

However, small-scale fisheries (SSFs) in developing countries play a relevant role in coastal communities' development with important impacts on the economy. The SSFs are normally multi-specific and due to the lack of data, studying them by simulation poses an important challenge especially forecasting models. These models are necessary to support management decisions or develop sustainable fisheries; therefore, models based on Deep Learning were proposed to forecast SSFs catch, using data from official catch landing reports (OCLRs), satellite images, and oceanographic data. The finfish fishery in Bahi Magdalena-Almejas (Mxico) was used for the present study. According to an analysis of OCLRs, the target species of major importance in the fishery were identified and selected for the model. The proposed deep learning models used two artificial neural networks structures: Non-linear autoregressive neural network and long-short term memory network, which were designed to assess and forecast monthly catch levels of Paralabrax nebulifer and Caulolatilus princeps. Models with a performance efficiency of R > 0.8, MSE < 300 were found, which indicate that the models are applicable in SSF with poor data and multi-specific fishery contexts, at low cost. © 2018 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Ecological uncertainty in fishery models is easily reduced using existing scientific literature, but social drivers are often poorly defined or understood. The lack of knowledge about fishermen behavior results in inaccurate models of questionable utility for fishery managers. We designed and constructed a high fidelity agent based model (ABM) using the socio-ecological framework that reduces social system uncertainty by capturing complex behaviors using data-driven bounded rationality and feedback. The resulting generalized ABM of CSES dynamics was instantiated to Pacific salmon fisheries at Kenai river in Upper Cook Inlet, Alaska. The data-driven model construction fuses multiple data-sets for classification of social and ecological fishery regimes into stochastic distributions; the agent behaviors were generalized by evolving parametrized equations using data-driven machine learning; multiple non-trivial metrics on multiple scales verified model's accuracy and predictive capacity. The verified model of CSES dynamics at the Kenai river revealed recent instability in the dipnet fishery coupled dynamics, historic instability in the drift gillnet fishery coupled dynamics due to a compensatory and aggressive fishing strategy, and in the future the model will be used for scenario-based studies to understand the outcomes of alternative management strategies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,,Scopus,Not relevant to marine ecosystem,,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,"Other (fidelity agent based

While changes are taking place at the upper trophic levels, exploitation of prey species and climate change are altering productivity at the lower levels. An Ecopath with Ecosim model was developed to simulate the ecosystem impacts of Reef Fish Fishery Management Plan Amendment 30B (which aims to rebuild Gag Mycteroperca microlepis) and Amendment 31 (which reduces effort in the longline fishery). We also evaluated the impact of a hypothetical increase in the exploitation of baitfish and future changes to phytoplankton productivity. The model predicted that rebuilding Gag will cause the biomass of Black Sea Bass Centropristis striata to be 20% lower than it is now and those of Black Grouper M. bonaci, King Mackerel Scomberomorus cavalla, and other shallow-water groupers to be 5-10% lower.

Menhaden management has been working toward ecological reference points (ERPs) that account for menhaden's role in the ecosystem. The goal of this work was to develop menhaden ERPs using ecosystem models. An existing Ecopath with Ecosim model of the Northwest Atlantic Continental Shelf (NWACS) was reduced in complexity from 61 to 17 species/functional groups. The new NWACS model of intermediate complexity for ecosystems (NWACS-MICE) serves to link the dynamics of menhaden with key managed predators. Striped bass (Morone saxatilis) were determined to be most sensitive to menhaden harvest and therefore served as an indicator of ecosystem impacts. ERPs were based on the tradeoff relationship between the equilibrium biomass of striped bass and menhaden fishing mortality (F). The ERPs were defined as the menhaden F rates that maintain striped bass at their biomass target and threshold when striped bass are fished at their F-target, and all other modeled species were fished at status quo levels. These correspond to an ERP F-target of 0.19 and an ERP F-threshold of 0.57, which are lower than the single species reference points by 30-40%, but higher than current (2017) menhaden F.

However, many fisheries have limited trip-level data due to low observer coverage. This article introduces a generalized linear model (GLM) utilizing machine learning (ML) techniques to develop a modeling approach to estimate the functional forms and predict the fishing trip costs of unsampled trips. GLM with Lasso regularization and ML cross-validation of model are done simultaneously for predictor selection and evaluation of the predictive power of a model. This modeling approach is applied to estimate the trip-level fishing costs using the empirical sampled trip costs and the associated trip-level fishing operational data and vessel characteristics in the Hawaii and American Samoa longline fisheries. Using this approach to build models is particularly important when there is no strong theoretical guideline on predictor selection. Also, the modeling approach addresses the issue of skewed trip cost data and provides predictive power measurement, compared with the previous modeling efforts in trip cost estimation for the Hawaii longline fishery. As a result, fishing trip costs for all trips in the fishery can be estimated. Lastly, this study applies the estimated trip cost model to conduct an empirical analysis to evaluate the impacts on trip costs due to spatial regulations in the Hawaii longline fishery. The results show that closing the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) could induce an average 14% increase in fishing trip costs, while the trip cost impacts of the Eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) closures could be lower.",English,Article,"gold, Green Published",WOS,,U.S. Pacific Island region,Pacific,">100,000",'NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT',Simulated dynamics,'NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT',The estimated trip costs from the trip cost model provides important information for sustainable fisheries management when regulatory changes or other external factors affect subgroups of a fleet differently.,"This study presented an empirical application of the estimated trip cost model to conduct a regulatory impact analysis, which is required by national standard guidelines of NOAA Fisheries.",Task 6.3 - social and economic effects on the impact of fisheries management,Other (Trip cost model),Other (Trip cost model),Other (no direct biological component),No species,Other (no population),multi-fleet/metier,"Hawaii longline fishery_American Samoa longline

Previous modeling studies have found that reserves may increase or decrease yields, depending on local environmental conditions and on the specific life-history traits of the fishery species. Sex-changing (female-to-male) fish are targets of some of the most important commercial and recreational fisheries in the world. The potential for disproportionate removal of the larger, older sex of such species requires new theory to facilitate our understanding of how reserves will affect the yields of surrounding fisheries, relative to fishes with separate sexes. We investigated this question by modeling the effects of marine reserves on a non-sex-changing and a sex-changing population. We used demographic parameter estimates for the common coral trout as a baseline, and we conducted extensive sensitivity analyses to determine how sustainable yields of sex-changing species are likely to be affected by reserves across a broad range of life-history parameters. Our findings indicate that fisheries for sex-changing species are unlikely to receive the same yield-enhancing benefit that non-sex-changing fisheries enjoy from marine reserves, and that often reserves tend to reduce sustainable yields for a given overall population size. Specifically, the increased egg production and high fertilization success within reserves is more than offset by the reduced egg production and fertilization success in the fished areas, relative to a system in which fishing mortality is distributed more evenly over the entire system. A key reason for this appears to be that fertilization success is reduced, on average, when males are unevenly distributed among subpopulations, as is the case when reserves are present. These findings suggests that, for sex-changing populations, reserves are more suited to rebuilding overfished populations and sustaining fishery viability, rather than enhancing fishery yields. These results are robust over a range of sex-change regimes, stock-recruitment relationships, adult mortality rates, individual growth strategies, and fertilization-success functions. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the different contributions of males and females to population growth and fishery yields when evaluating the efficacy of marine reserves for enhancement of fished species. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.",English,Article,,Scopus,,Great Barrier Reef,Australia,">100,000",multidecadal,'NOT RELEVANT',year,Simulated dynamics,'NOT RELEVANT',3,3,,,Task 6.2 - climatic and ecological effects on the impact of fisheries management,Other (single species population dynamics model),Other (single species population dynamics model),Single stock,Plectropomus leopardus,age_sex structured,Fleet not considered,,No,No spatial context,No,,Spatial management ,No,Economic,sustainable yield,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_0218,Liontakis,A.

The bioeconomic framework presented here provides a simple means for analysing complex interactions between fishery resource management, domestic fleet development, and the role of foreign fleets. The model includes explicit dynamics of the fish stock and the domestic fleet, and allows for harvest rate and investment rate controls. Several realistic behavioral components are also incorporated: (i) multi-objective optimization, balancing the direct benefits of rent generation with the indirect benefits of domestic fleet development; (ii) socio-political constraints, which lead the coastal state to accord its domestic fleet absolute priority in harvesting within coastal waters; (iii) limitations on access to capital, which restrict growth of the domestic fleet to that which can be financed through fishery revenues; (iv) interactions between the coastal state and the foreign fleets, in which the former is able to set a royalty rate, applied per unit of foreign harvest, while the foreign fleet responds to any specified royalty rate on a profit-maximizing basis. Analysis of the model indicates that optimal fishery development policies may depend particularly on the relative profitability of the domestic fleet, as well as the extent to which an explicit value is placed on the employment and secondary benefits of domestic fleet development. © 1991.",English,Article,,Scopus,,NOT RELEVANT,Not relevant,'NOT RELEVANT',multidecadal,'NOT RELEVANT',year,Simulated dynamics,'NOT RELEVANT',3,3,,,Task 6.4 - targets and limits for indicators in an ecosystem context ,Other (Resource stock dynamics model (Beverton-Holt type)),Other (Resource stock dynamics model (Beverton-Holt type)),Single stock,NOT RELEVANT,Biomass aggregated,multi-fleet/metier,Domestic_foreign,Yes,No spatial context,No,,Technical measures ,No,Biological,Harvest rate_TAC,no,NOT RELEVANT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_0220,Casagrandi,"Chavez, EA","BIO-ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT OF A GREEN CRAB FISHERY IN BAJA CALIFORNIA SOUTH, MEXICO",2016,CALIFORNIA COOPERATIVE OCEANIC FISHERIES INVESTIGATIONS REPORTS,57,,124,131,,,"Optimum bio-economic harvesting strategies of the green crab Callinectes bellicosus (Stimpson) fishery of Magdalena Bay Mexico, were evaluated.

As such, the protection of a common fishery resource is worth investigating. In this paper we develop a two-period model and a multi-period model to analyze the optimal inter-temporal utilization of a finite resource of stock and propose to impose a tax on the harvest rate as an efficient mechanism with an aim at economic sustainability by incorporating the future opportunity of harvesting into the models as a major component of social objectives. The sensitivity analysis of the two-period model shows that (1) labor inputs for harvesting in Period 1 should be reduced, the biomass of fishery stock will increase, but the harvesting in Period 2 should be amplified and the biomass of fishery stock in Period 2 will not be affected if the current generation owns a higher valuation on the future opportunity of harvesting; (2) a higher internal regeneration rate leads to higher harvesting in each period and a higher level of fishery stock in Period 1, but an uncertain level of fishery stock in Period 2; (3) with a higher discount rate the harvesting in Period 1 should increase, but the harvesting in Period 2 should fall and the level of fishery stock in each period will be reduced; (4) a higher fish price in Period 1 leads to higher harvesting in Period 1, but reduced harvesting in Period 2. As a consequence, the level of fishery stock in each period will be reduced; (5) the effect of a change in fish prices in Period 2 on the harvesting and the level of fishery stock in Period 1 is uncertain, but the change in fish prices in Period 2 gives a positive effect on harvesting in Period 2 and a negative effect on the level of fishery stock in Period 2; (6) higher labor wages in Period 1 lead to lower harvesting, but a higher level of fishery stock in Period 1. This encourages an increase in harvesting in Period 2 and leads to a higher level of fishery stock in Period 2; and (7) a change of the labor wage in Period 2 affects the harvesting and the level of fishery stock in Period 1 indecisively, but it gives negative effects on the harvesting in Period 2 and positive effects on the level of fishery stock in Period 2. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Using the Ecopath with Ecosim software, a trophic structure model is constructed for 2006-2007 to characterize the food web structure, functioning, and describing the ecosystem impacts of fishing. Input information for the model were gathered from published and unpublished reports and from our own estimates during the period 2006-2007. Pedigree work and simple sensitivity analysis were carried out to evaluate the quality and the uncertainty of the model. Results show that the food web in the enclosed sea area was dominated by a detritus pathway. The trophic levels of the groups varied from 1.00 for primary producers and detritus to 3.90 for piscivorous fish in the artificial system. Using network analysis, the system network was mapped into a linear food chain, and five discrete trophic levels were found with a mean transfer efficiency of 9.8% from detritus, 9.4% from primary producer within the ecosystem. The geometric mean of the trophic transfer efficiencies was 9.5%. Detritus contributed 57% of the total energy flux, and the other 43% came from primary producers. The ecosystem maturity indices-TPP/TR (total primary production/total respiration), FCI (Finn cycling index), A (ascendancy) and TB/TDET were 2.672, 25%, 31.5%, and 0.013, respectively, showing that the artificial system is at developmental stage according to Odum's theory of ecosystem development. The 'Keystoneness' result indicates that herbivorous zooplankton was identified as keystone species in this system. Furthermore, a simple dynamical simulation was preformed for varying fishing mortality over 10 years. The biomass of most fish groups has a small increase when the fishing mortality at current level. Increasing fishing mortality by twofold resulted in a marked decrease in biomass of piscivorous fish accompanied by an increase in that of other fish groups, notable zooplanktivorous fish.

In this research, BP artificial neural network method was applied, with which a neural network model was established based on the production data and environmental data of T. alalunga from 2012 to 2019. The output factor was the normalized fishing production data, and the input factors were spatial factors (including longitude and latitude), marine environmental factors, including sea surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll-a concentration, (chl a), and sea surface salinity (SSS), from which 18 BP neural network models were run using 10?10 cross-validation model stability, mean square error (MSE), average relative variance (ARV), and goodness of fit (R2) as the judgement of accuracy and stability of different models. Finally, Model 5-18-1 (hidden layer node 18) was chosen as the best model; its average MSE value is 0.022 32, and average ARV value is 0.511. The optimal model prediction results and the actual catch data during the same period were superimposed and compared, showing consistent results. Meanwhile, sensitivity analysis of environmental factors showed that SST significantly affected the distribution of T. alalunga fisheries in the Indian Ocean, with a contribution rate of 0.2.

Employment multipliers vary much more across types of fisheries, but also around an average of 2.9; here it was clear that longer value chains result in more employment. © 2013 The Authors.",English,Article,,Scopus,,Peru,South America,">100,000",multidecadal,">100,000",multidecadal,Fisheries Dependent Data,3,2,3,similar lessons can be drawn in many other countries with regards to the importance of the small scale versus the industrial part ofthe fishing industry.,,Task 6.3 - social and economic effects on the impact of fisheries management,EwE,EwE,Ecosystem model,all,Biomass aggregated,multi-fleet/metier,all fleets,Yes,No spatial context,No,,No management measures,No,Social,Employment,yes,EwE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_0240,Jacobsen,V.

Using available fisheries and ecosystem data, we develop an Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) model to represent current ecosystem and fishing dynamics in BCS and explore the ecological and economic effects of specific fisheries policy measures. Results suggest that currently mandated bycatch limits for the longlining fleet will have little effect on marlin abundance in the area. In an overfished ecosystem, decreasing fishing effort can result in higher overall catches through population rebuilding. While perhaps ecologically justified, increases in the abundance of sharks, a top predator, can have negative effects on other valued species in the ecosystem.

Some parameters, such as selectivity or survey catchabilities, can present a wide range of shapes and the introduction of smooth functions, which up to now have not been widely used in assessment models, allows for more flexibility to capture underlying nonlinear structures. In this work a simulation study emulating a sardine population is carried out to compare three different methods for uncertainty estimation: multivariate normal distribution, bootstrap (without and with relative bias correction) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In order to study their performance depending on the model complexity, five different scenarios are defined depending on the shape of the smooth function of the fishing mortality. From 100 simulated datasets, performance is measured in terms of point estimation, coefficients of variation, bias, skewness, coverage probabilities, and correlation. In all approaches model fitting is carried out using the a4a framework. All three methods result in very similar performance. The main differences are found for observation variance parameters where the bootstrap and the multivariate normal approach result in underestimation of these parameters. In general, MCMC is considered to have better performance, being able to detect skewness, showing small relative bias and reaching expected coverage probabilities. It is also more efficient in terms of time consumption in comparison with bootstrapping. © The Author 2017.

This fishery has the biggest fleet in the area, it is highly multispecies, and catches are largely composed of juveniles of target species and non-target species, which are often discarded in large quantities. Simulations indicate that improvement of trawl selectivity would have noticeable and complex direct and indirect effects on target and non-target demersal species. The biomass and catch of various commercial species (e.g. anglerfish, adult hake) would increase, while that of invertebrates (e.g. suprabenthos, Norway lobster) and juvenile and small-sized fish species (e.g. juvenile hake, blue whiting) would decrease due to higher predation mortalities and trophic cascades in the food web. Impacts on the pelagic compartment would also be noticeable. A slight increase in the mean trophic level of the community and of the catch is predicted, as well as of ecosystem biomass diversity. Generally, however, a greater reduction of fishing effort would be necessary for the recovery of highly exploited or overexploited demersal species. Trawling would experience moderate decreases in catches, while long-lining and bait-trolling would benefit. This work highlights the importance of including the mortality incurred during or post-escape from trawl nets when assessing the ecosystem effects of improved trawl selectivity. © Inter-Research 2008.",English,Article,,Scopus,,"Ebro River Delta, South Catalan Sea (NW Mediterranean)",Europe,">100,000",quarter,">100,000",'NOT RELEVANT',Regular Fisheries Independent Survey,2,2,3,"However, a drastic reduction of fishing effort in parallel with a greater increase in gear selectivity would be necessary for the recovery of highly exploited or overexploited demersal species and the ecosystem.",,Task 6.2_Task 6.4_Task 6.5,EwE,EwE,Ecosystem model_Multi-stock (with species interactions),Functional groups,Biomass aggregated,multi-fleet/metier,Bottom-trawling_Purse-seining_Long-lining_Bait-trolling ,No,Spatially explicit,Yes,Phytoplankton production ,Other (Mesh size_Gear type),No,Ecosystem based,Total biomass_Total fishable biomass_Total top predator biomass_Mean trophic level of the community_Mean trophic level of the catch_Total catches_Modified version of Kempton's index of biodiversity,yes,EwE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_0264,AZTI_Aranda,"Coll, M; Navarro, J; Olson, RJ; Christensen, V",Assessing the trophic position and ecological role of squids in marine ecosystems by means of food-web models,2013,DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY,95,,21,36,10.1016/j.dsr2.2012.08.020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsr2.2012.08.020,"We synthesized available information from ecological models at local and regional scales to obtain a global picture of the trophic position and ecological role of squids in marine ecosystems. First, static food-web models were used to analyze basic ecological parameters and indicators of squids: biomass, production, consumption, trophic level, omnivory index, predation mortality diet, and the ecological role. In addition, we developed various dynamic temporal simulations using two food-web models that included squids in their parameterization, and we investigated potential impacts of fishing pressure and environmental conditions for squid populations and, consequently, for marine food webs. Our results showed that squids occupy a large range of trophic levels in marine food webs and show a large trophic width, reflecting the versatility in their feeding behaviors and dietary habits. Models illustrated that squids are abundant organisms in marine ecosystems, and have high growth and consumption rates, but these parameters are highly variable because squids are adapted to a large variety of environmental conditions. Results also show that squids can have a large trophic impact on other elements of the food web, and top-down control from squids to their prey can be high. In addition, some squid species are important prey of apical predators and may be keystone species in marine food webs. In fact, we found strong interrelationships between neritic squids and the populations of their prey and predators in coastal and shelf areas, while the role of squids in open ocean and upwelling ecosystems appeared more constrained to a bottom-up impact on their predators. Therefore, large removals of squids will likely have large-scale effects on marine ecosystems. In addition, simulations confirm that squids are able to benefit from a general increase in fishing pressure, mainly due to predation release, and quickly respond to changes triggered by the environment. Squids may thus be very sensitive to the effects of fishing and climate change. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Models represented the ecosystem during the late 1970s, mid 1990s, early 2000s, and a simulated no-fishing scenario. The underlying hypothesis was that ecosystem models should quantitatively capture the increasing exploitation in the ecosystem from the 1970s to 2000s, as well as differences between the exploited and non-exploited scenarios. Biomass showed a general decrease, while there was an increase in biomass at lower trophic levels (TL) from the 1970s to 2000s. The efficiency of energy transfer (TE) from lower to higher TLs significantly increased with time. The ecosystem during the 1990s showed higher biomass and flows than during the 1970s and 2000s due to an increase in small pelagic fish biomass (especially sardines). Exploited food webs also showed similarities in terms of general structure and functioning due to high intensity of fishing already in the 1970s. This intensity was highlighted with low trophic levels in the catch, high consumption of production by fisheries, medium to high primary production required to sustain the catches and high losses in secondary production due to fishing. Significant differences on ecosystem structure and functioning were highlighted between the exploited and no-fishing scenarios. Biomass of higher TLs increased under the no-fishing scenario and the mean trophic level of the community and the fish/invertebrate biomass ratios were substantially lower in exploited food webs. The efficiency of energy transfer (TE) from lower to higher TLs was lower under the no-fishing scenario, and it showed a continuous decrease with increasing TL Marine mammals, large hake, anglerfish and large pelagic fish were identified as keystone species of the ecosystem when there was no fishing, while their ecological importance notably decreased under the exploited periods. On the contrary, the importance of small-sized organisms such as benthic invertebrates and small pelagic fish was higher in exploited food webs. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We use a process-oriented model to explore the extent to which changes in marine resources and the ecosystem were driven by trophic interactions, environmental factors and fishing activities. Fishing effort and fishing mortality are used to drive the model, while observed (absolute and relative) biomasses and catches are compared with the predicted results. A reduction in the sum of the squared deviations of the observed and predicted values of the biomass is used as a metric for calibrating and assessing the fit of the model. A posteriori trophodynamic indicators are used to explore the ecosystem's structural and functional changes from 1978 to 2003, and a generalized least squares regression is used to assess the significance of the predicted trends. In general, a high proportion of the variability in the time series data is explained by the main trophic interactions (37-53%), fishing activities (14%), and indirectly by considering the environment (6-16%), as driving factors. The model's predictions match satisfactorily with the yearly data on the biomass for anglerfish, adult hake, demersal sharks, anchovy and mackerel, which show a statistically significant decrease over time, while the biomass of flatfish and seabirds are observed to increase. Catch data show a significant decrease in anglerfish, demersal sharks, anchovy and sardine, while there is an increase in red mullet, flatfish, juvenile hake and horse mackerel. These changes in biomass are predicted to have direct and indirect impacts on the ecosystem mediated by the trophic web, such as the proliferation of non-commercial species with lower trophic levels (e.g., benthic invertebrates) or higher turnover rates (e.g., cephalopods and benthopelagic fish). This is consistent with anecdotal information from the Mediterranean and is likely caused by trophic cascades due to the removal of demersal and pelagic higher trophic level organisms (predator release), and a decrease in small pelagic fish (competitor release). Trophodynamic indicators suggest a degradation pattern over time: both the mean trophic level of the community (mTLco, excluding primary producers and detritus) and a modified version of Kempton's index of biodiversity decrease with time, while the total flow to detritus and the loss of production due to fishing increase from 1978 to 2003. Additionally, the demersal/pelagic ratio increases due to an overall decrease in the abundance of small pelagic fish in the ecosystem. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we used Ecospace, the spatial-temporal dynamic module of Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) food web model, to drive a spatially explicit marine food web model representing the Southern Catalan Sea (NW Mediterranean) with various environmental drivers and with fishing. We then evaluated the individual and joint effects of environmental conditions and fishing in various compartments of the food web. First we used a previously developed EwE model fitted to time series of data from 1978 to 2010 as a baseline configuration. The model included 40 functional groups and four fishing fleets. We first ran the original Ecospace spatial-temporal dynamic model using the original habitat configuration, in addition to fishing, and we predicted species distributions and abundances. Afterwards, we ran the new habitat foraging capacity model using the most important environmental drivers linked with the Ebro River delta dynamics (salinity, temperature, and primary production), in addition to depth, substrate and fishing, and we compared results with those from the original implementation of Ecospace. Three commercial species, European hake (Merluccius merluccius), anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) and sardine (Sardina pilchardus), were used to analyse results. Species distributions more closely matched the empirical information available from the study area when using the new habitat capacity model. Results suggested that the historical impacts of fishing and environmental conditions on the biomass and distributions of hake, anchovy and sardine were not additive, but mainly cumulative with a synergistic or antagonistic effect. Fishing had the highest impact on spatial modelling results while the spatial distribution of primary producers and depth followed in importance. This study contributes to the development of more reliable predictions of regional change in marine ecosystems of the Mediterranean Sea. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,,Scopus,Not relevant to fisheries management evaluation models,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_0269,Gascuel,M.

EcoTroph (ET) is a recently developed approach and software for modeling aquatic eco - systems, articulated entirely around the trophic level concept. Here, we used ET to investigate impacts of 2 trophic controls (i.e. foraging arena and top-down controls) on marine ecosystem trophic flows and associated fishing effects. A new version of the ET model accounting for the foraging arena theory was developed. Cross impacts of the 2 trophic controls and different fishing scenarios were analyzed using a virtual ecosystem. Results showed that foraging arena controls decreased the resistance and production of an ecosystem facing increasing fishing mortality. In contrast, the inclusion of top-down controls resulted in a more resistant ecosystem, with a decrease in the kinetics of trophic flows at lower trophic levels (TLs) when the abundance of higher TLs is reduced by fishing. These 2 controls increased the interactions between TLs, and, in part, shaped fishing impacts at the ecosystem scale. Then, we applied ET to 3 real ecosystems which have been previously modeled using Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE). EcoTroph and Ecosim predictions related to changes in fishing effort were compared, and showed that accounting for trophic controls enabled EcoTroph to mimic Ecosim models, and better reflect associated changes in trophic flows.

Ecosystem models are needed to codify the relationships among drivers, pressures and resulting states, and to quantify the trade-offs between conflicting objectives. Incorporating ecosystem considerations requires moving from the single-species models used in stock assessments, to more complex models that include species interactions, environmental drivers and human consequences. With this increasing model complexity, model fit can improve, but parameter uncertainty increases. At intermediate levels of complexity, there is a Ôsweet spotÕ at which the uncertainty in policy indicators is at a minimum. Finding the sweet spot in models requires compromises: for example, to include additional component species, the models of each species have in some cases been simplified from age-structured to logistic or bioenergetic models. In this paper, we illuminate the characteristics, capabilities and short-comings of the various modelling approaches being proposed for ecosystem-based fisheries management. We identify key ecosystem needs in fisheries management and indicate which types of models can meet these needs. Ecosystem models have been playing strategic roles by providing an ecosystem context for single-species management decisions. However, conventional stock assessments are being increasingly challenged by changing natural mortality rates and environmentally driven changes in productivity that are observed in many fish stocks. Thus, there is a need for more tactical ecosystem models that can respond dynamically to changing ecological and environmental conditions. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",English,Article,,Scopus,,None,Not relevant,'NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT',"The recent push towards ecosystem-based fisheries management has motivated considerable development, implementation and testing of ecosystem models.

In this paper, we describe an integrated assessment model (IAM) that numerically simulates oceanographic, population dynamic, and socioeconomic relationships for the U.S. commercial sea scallop fishery. Our primary goal is to enrich resource management deliberations by offering both short-and long-term insight into the system and generating detailed policy-relevant information about the relative effects of ocean acidification, temperature rise, fishing pressure, and socioeconomic factors on the fishery using a simplified model system. Starting with relationships and data used now for sea scallop fishery management, the model adds socioeconomic decision making based on static economic theory and includes ocean biogeochemical change resulting from CO2 emissions. The model skillfully reproduces scallop population dynamics, market dynamics, and seawater carbonate chemistry since 2000. It indicates sea scallop harvests could decline substantially by 2050 under RCP 8.5 CO2 emissions and current harvest rules, assuming that ocean acidification affects P. magellanicus by decreasing recruitment and slowing growth, and that ocean warming increases growth.

We address the non-cooperative exploitation of a migratory renewable resource in the presence of possible regime shift that affects its movement. Motivated by the anticipated effects of climate change, we model a regime shift that will alter the spatial movement patterns of the resource at some point in the future. We develop a stochastic spatial bioeconomic model to address the effects of this class of regime shift on non-cooperative harvest decisions made by decentralized owners such as countries exploiting a migratory fish or other natural resource stock. We find that the threat of a future shift modifies the standard golden rule"", and may induce more aggressive harvest everywhere, irrespective of whether the owner will be advantaged or disadvantaged by the shift. We also identify conditions under which the threat of regime shift induces owners to reduce harvest rates in advance of the shift. Our analysis suggests that different property rights structures (single ownership vs common property) or heterogeneous growth can give rise to previously unexplored incentives and can even reverse conventional wisdom about how countries will react to the prospect of future environmental change. © 2018 The Author(s).

Declining catch per unit effort (CPUE) and a negative trend in landings since 2000 have raised concerns among fishermen, researchers, and fishery managers as to the fishery's sustainability. The Fish and Wildlife Research Institute of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission estimates that the state's stone crab fishery has been overexploited since 1997. This stock status determination, however, is based largely on trends in total landings and CPUE and does not account for the life-history parameters that describe stock productivity, such as size at maturity, fecundity, and survivorship. In this study, an age-structured per-recruit model was developed to evaluate how alternative biological parameters and management scenarios might affect reproductive output, calculated as the spawning potential ratio (SPR), of a theoretical stone crab population. The model incorporated new estimates of size at maturity, fecundity, and temperature-dependent release mortalities. Spawning potential ratios increased with decreasing size at sexual maturity and were sensitive to increasing natural mortality. The largest contributor to changes in SPR was mortality associated with the declawing and release of stone crabs. We also assessed various management scenarios including regulations governing minimum claw length, requiring the use of juvenile trap excluder devices, and institution of temperature-dependent season openings. Increasing the minimum claw length and excluding small juveniles from traps provided moderate protection to the spawning stock. The model suggests that adaptive management strategies that allow fishing only when water temperatures are below 24 degrees C (the temperature at which modeled survival is improved) could greatly reduce mortality and increase SPR.

To address the problems of accounting for uncertainty when formulating scientific advice for the management of highly migratory fish stocks, management decisions need to be based upon assessment models that represent plausible alternative hypotheses for stock structure and migration patterns of the exploited populations. We present a multi-stock, multi-fleet, multi-area, seasonally structured Bayesian state-space model in which different stocks spawn in spatially different areas and the mixing of these stocks is explicitly accounted for in the absence of sufficient tagging data with which to estimate migration rates. The model is applied to the Northeast Atlantic mackerel Scomber scombrus population, accounting for the annual spawning-feeding-overwintering migration patterns of the three spawning components, together with uncertainty in the extent to which the southern component migrates north to feed and overwinter, and consequently the extent to which it mixes with the other components and is subject to exploitation. The model allows the effect of exploitation on the individual components to be assessed, and the results suggest that the fishing mortality of southern spawning adults was insensitive to the extent to which they migrated north.

National and international management of fisheries interactions with marine turtles are rarely tied to turtle population biology. Quantitative tools tied to population-based objectives can provide insight into the effectiveness and urgency of bycatch mitigation.A management approach is proposed based on a bycatch control rule called Reproductive Value Loss Limit (RVLL), generalized from the Potential Biological Removal management model for marine mammal populations. For RVLL, population size is scaled by reproductive value to account for strongly age-structured population dynamics and age-dependent fisheries mortality rates in marine turtle populations.RVLL is an estimate of maximum sustainable mortality for a population, calculated from estimates of maximum population growth rate, total reproductive value in the population, and an uncertainty factor. RVLL estimates correspond to specified management goals and risk tolerances. For demonstration, simultaneous goals of maintaining populations above the maximum net productivity level (analogous to the population size that produces maximum sustainable yield) and preventing a decrease in adults are assumed, both with 95% probability. A management-strategy-evaluation-like process was used to explore parameterization of the RVLL equation for robust performance over a range of plausible life history characteristics and uncertainties in abundance and bycatch mortality estimates for marine turtle populations.The RVLL-based management approach presented here proved robust to several important sources of uncertainty and to violation of several key underlying assumptions, and can be adapted to account for important sources of bias. The architecture presented, including tailored management strategy evaluation, provides a useful basis for further development of reference-point-based management of human-added mortality in populations that experience large changes with age in reproductive value and human-caused mortality rates, as is the case for marine turtles. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",English,Article,,Scopus,,Not relevant,Not relevant,'NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT',Simulated dynamics,'NOT RELEVANT',2,3,"The RVLL tool proposed, combined with MSE, provides the general architecture for managing age-structured, data-limited populations based on data types currently available or obtainable for many (though probably not all) marine turtle populations, while explicitly accounting for uncertainty and evaluating robustness.",age-structure extension of Potential Biological Removal,Task 6.2 - climatic and ecological effects on the impact of fisheries management,Other (Potential Biological Removal framework),Other (Potential Biological Removal framework),Single stock,marine turtles,Age structured,Fleet not considered,,No,No spatial context,No,,Output control ,Not clear,Biological,Reproductive value loss limit,not clear,Potential Biological Removal framework developed under the US Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA),An MSE-like approach to estimate maximum sutainable mortality of marine sea turtles caused by human activities,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_0301,Mari,"Curtis, KA; Moore, JE; Benson, SR",Estimating Limit Reference Points for Western Pacific Leatherback Turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) in the US West Coast EEZ,2015,PLOS ONE,10,9,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0136452,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0136452,"Biological limit reference points (LRPs) for fisheries catch represent upper bounds that avoid undesirable population states. LRPs can support consistent management evaluation among species and regions, and can advance ecosystem-based fisheries management. For transboundary species, LRPs prorated by local abundance can inform local management decisions when international coordination is lacking. We estimated LRPs for western Pacific leatherbacks in the U.S. West Coast Exclusive Economic Zone (WCEEZ) using three approaches with different types of information on local abundance. For the current application, the best-informed LRP used a local abundance estimate derived from nest counts, vital rate information, satellite tag data, and fishery observer data, and was calculated with a Potential Biological Removal estimator. Management strategy evaluation was used to set tuning parameters of the LRP estimators to satisfy risk tolerances for falling below population thresholds, and to evaluate sensitivity of population outcomes to bias in key inputs. We estimated local LRPs consistent with three hypothetical management objectives: allowing the population to rebuild to its maximum net productivity level (4.7 turtles per five years), limiting delay of population rebuilding (0.8 turtles per five years), or only preventing further decline (7.7 turtles per five years). These LRPs pertain to all human-caused removals and represent the WCEEZ contribution to meeting population management objectives within a broader international cooperative framework. We present multi-year estimates, because at low LRP values, annual assessments are prone to substantial error that can lead to volatile and costly management without providing further conservation benefit. The novel approach and the performance criteria used here are not a direct expression of the jeopardy standard of the U.S. Endangered Species Act, but they provide useful assessment information and could help guide international management frameworks.

Considering these endogenous constraints, a dynamic optimization problem was solved to find fishing mortality (F) trajectories that maximize discounted profits per vessel, subject to recovery of the stock to a spawning-stock biomass (SSB) target in 2015. The algorithm developed was used to assess the southern hake recovery plan. Three scenarios were analysed: (1) represents the current plan with an annual 10 reduction in F; (2) represents the optimum trajectory where profits must be positive all along and the SSB target is reached no later than 2015, and (3) represents the optimum trajectory allowing profits to be negative. The results from (3) indicate that if economic and social restrictions are not considered a prior condition, the optimum solution implies a fleet reduction in 2010 and 2011. Comparing (1) and (2), our results suggest that reducing F to 0.30 by 2010 achieves the recovery target in 2012, increases the net present profits by 7.7 relative to the current plan, and is compatible with maintaining the current fleet size. © 2010 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

We consider a stochastic age-structured model for a fishery composed by a number of fishing units (fleets, vessels or me tiers) that optimally select the level of fishing effort to be applied considering total mortalities as given. The introduction of a balance constrain which guarantees that total mortality is equal to the sum of individual fishing mortalities optimally selected, enables total fishing mortality to be determined as a combination of contemporaneous abundance and stochastic processes affecting the fishery. In this way, future abundance can be projected as a dynamic system that depends on contemporaneous abundance. The model is generic and can be applied to several issues of fisheries management. In particular, we illustrate how to apply the methodology to assess the floating band target management regime for controlling fishing mortalities which is inspired in the new multi-annual plans.

Moreover, economic time series are difficult to maintain due to fishermen weariness and sample coverage is often insufficient. To overcome these problems, the paper builds predictive models per operational cost category (fuel, landing, other variable, fixed, salary and total) for the French Bay of Biscay fleet. The cost models had good fit and stressed the key role of gear and vessel size (length mostly) for explaining fishing costs. They suggested that only a small list of variables was needed to predict costs (days-at-sea, total revenue, vessel age, length and power, district and fishing zone). These variables are easy to obtain for all vessels. In addition, some fitted cost models (total, landing and fixed costs) could be applied to the neighbouring English Channel, which suggested similarities between their fishing cost structures. Finally, the comparison of design-based and model-based cost estimates for the Bay of Biscay French fleet confirmed that modelling fishing costs on the basis of a small set of explanatory variables is a good alternative to design-based estimates which generally require costly annual sampling programs.

Yet predicting the behaviour of natural resource users in complex, changeable systems presents a significant challenge for managers. Scenario planning, which involves thinking creatively about how a socio-ecological system might develop under a set of possible futures, was used to explore uncertainties in the future of the Indian Ocean tuna purse seine fishery. This exercise stimulated thinking on how key social, economic and environmental conditions that influence fleet behaviour may change in the future, and how these changes might affect the dynamics of fishing effort. Three storylines were explored: an increase in marine protection, growing consumer preference for sustainable seafood, and depletion of tuna stocks. Comparing across several possible future scenarios, a number of critical aspects of fleet behaviour were identified that should be important considerations for fishery managers, but which are currently poorly understood. These included a switch in fishing practices, reallocation of effort in space, investment in new vessels and exit from the fishery. Recommendations for future management interventions in the Indian Ocean were offered, along with suggestions for research needed to reduce management uncertainty. © 2015 The Authors.",English,Article,,Scopus,Not relevant to fisheries management evaluation models,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The study is descriptive without presenting a model or a dataset.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_0317,Bitetto,"De Anda-Montanez, A; Seijo, JC","Bioeconomics of the Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) fishery in the Gulf of California, Mexico",1999,CALIFORNIA COOPERATIVE OCEANIC FISHERIES INVESTIGATIONS REPORTS,40,,170,178,,,"A bioeconomic model integrating biological and economic factors is developed for the Pacific sardine fishery in the Gulf of California.

The coexistence of small-scale fisheries (SSFs) and large-scale fisheries (LSFs) increases management complexity. Management actions have ecological and social implications that must be addressed carefully. We applied a bioeconomic game-theoretical model to the four-gear mullet fishery in southern Brazil - one industrial LSF (purse seine) and three artisanal SSFs (gillnet, beach seine, and drift net). All fishing gears target adult individuals during mullet's reproductive migration. First, we explored whether the current fishing efforts of all fishing gears could persist over time.

We propose a stochastic viability approach to address such problems. We consider a discrete-time control dynamical model with uncertainties, representing a bioeconomic system. The sustainability of this system is described by a set of constraints, defined in practice by indicators - namely, state, control and uncertainty functions - together with thresholds. This approach aims at identifying decision rules such that a set of constraints, representing various objectives, is respected with maximal probability. Under appropriate monotonicity properties of dynamics and constraints, having economic and biological content, we characterize an optimal feedback.

However, determining the effects of this hypoxic zone on fish and fisheries has proven to be more difficult. The dual effect of nutrient loading on secondary production (positive effects of bottom-up fueling, and negative effects of reduced oxygen levels) impedes the quantification of hypoxia effects on fish and fisheries. The objective of this study was to develop an ecosystem model that is able to separate the two effects, and to evaluate net effects of hypoxia on fish biomass and fisheries landings. An Ecospace model was developed using Ecopath with Ecosim software with an added plug-in to include spatially and temporally dynamic Chlorophyll a (Chl a) and dissolved oxygen (DO) values derived from a coupled physical-biological hypoxia model. Effects of hypoxia were determined by simulating scenarios with DO and Chl a included separately and combined, and a scenario without fish response to Chl a or DO. Fishing fleets were included in the model as well; fleets move to cells with highest revenue following a gravitational model. Results of this model suggest that the increases in total fish biomass and fisheries landings as a result of an increase in primary production outweigh the decreases as a result of hypoxic conditions. However, the results also demonstrated that responses were species-specific, and some species such as red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) did suffer a net loss in biomass.

Mitigation measures that address impacts exceeding the acceptable level also require assessment. The various fishing mtiers have different ecosystem impacts and this makes it difficult to assess them jointly. Sensitivity of the ecosystem to individual fishing mtiers has been assessed previously, but to our knowledge, concurrent comparisons of different mtiers on the same ecosystem have not been done. In this study, we combined the main characteristics of established approaches to sensitivity assessment into a single roadmap, called Sensitivity Assessment of Gear Effects (SAGE). SAGE is a widely applicable, three-step process to assess the ecological concerns of EAFM. The methodology used in the SAGE roadmap is built on a scoring system, which then results in a sensitivity index of the ecosystem components to the fishing mtiers. The scoring system is based on a combination of expert judgement and data, both qualitative and quantitative. It allows for cross-evaluation of fishing mtiers and ecosystem components. Sensitivity maps are created using the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of the ecosystem components in the index. The uncertainty of the sensitivity scores and maps are estimated through a pedigree index. The index is based on proxy representation, empirical basis, methodological rigour, theoretical understanding and degree of validation, all of which measure the strength of the research results. The proposed methodology is illustrated using a case study that compares the ecosystem effects of beam trawl and trammel net fisheries. The selected examples did not result in unexpected outcomes, but were rather chosen to evaluate the applicability of our methodology. They illustrate how a semi-quantitative framework, which includes the uncertainties associated with scientific assessments, can deliver holistic advice to fisheries managers in a fully transparent manner. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",English,Article,,Scopus,Not relevant to fisheries management evaluation models,,,'NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT',,Methodological paper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The paper is methodological dealing with the sensitivity ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_0330,WU_Binch,G.

Through the course of 2019, the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council developed a conceptual model of ecosystem linkages and risks for summer flounder, a species of recreational and commercial fisheries importance. The proximal aim of the model was to develop a list of integrated management questions that could be refined and addressed through a future quantitative management strategy evaluation. As such, this conceptual model served as a scoping tool. However, the true value of the conceptual model lays elsewhere: familiarizing resource managers historically focused on single-species management with the potential utility of an ecosystem approach to management. This paper details the goals and development of the conceptual model and situates this process in the broader context of best practices for collaborative open science and scientific reproducibility.

Recently, attention has been given to the management of forage fish, including anadromous river herring (Alewife Alosa pseudoharengus, blueback herring A. aestivalis) and American shad (A. sapidissima) due to their current depleted status and historically important ecological and economic roles. Little is known about the impact of changes in their biomass on marine food webs and what management practices will promote their recovery. Estimated historical riverine productivity was utilized to evaluate potential ecosystem impacts of the increasing river to ocean connectivity to resemble 19th-century conditions. The Ecopath with Ecosim modeling framework was used to simulate management strategies, focused on anadromous forage fish, by creating scenarios of fisheries reduction (mixed fishery effort reduction) and river to ocean habitat connectivity (75% of historical connectivity achieved). Sixty-year simulations covered the entire time series including a 36-year forecast period to evaluate the ecosystem impacts of management strategies. Results suggest nonlinear relationships and large changes in biomass flows from forage fish to upper trophic levels in the Gulf of Maine ecosystem. Increases in biomass were observed for pelagic sharks, demersal piscivores, and species of conservation concern such as pinnipeds and seabirds, although overall results were strongly influenced by indirect trophic effects. Promoting anadromous forage fish recovery through increased connectivity resulted in the redundancy of marine ecosystem niches that would increase resilience to climate, fisheries, and other perturbations.

Many of these fisheries also tend to have a mix of information, with stock assessments available for some species and almost no information on other species. The fleets themselves comprise fishers from small family enterprises to large vertically integrated businesses. The Queensland trawl fishery in Australia is used as a case study for this kind of fishery.

Recently, maximum economic yield (MEY) has been identified as a primary management objective for Australian fisheries and is under consideration elsewhere. However, first attempts at estimating MEY as an actual management target for a real fishery (rather than a conceptual or theoretical exercise) have highlighted some substantial complexities generally unconsidered by fisheries economists. Here, we highlight some of the main issues encountered in our experience and their implications for estimating and transitioning to MEY. Using a bioeconomic model of an Australian fishery for which MEY is the management target, we note that unconstrained optimization may result in effort trajectories that would not be acceptable to industry or managers. Different assumptions regarding appropriate constraints result in different outcomes, each of which may be considered a valid MEY. Similarly, alternative treatments of prices and costs may result in differing estimates of MEY and their associated effort trajectories. To develop an implementable management strategy in an adaptive management framework, a set of assumptions must be agreed among scientists, economists, and industry and managers, indicating that operationalizing MEY is not simply a matter of estimating the numbers but requires strong industry commitment and involvement.",English,Article,"Bronze, Green Published",WOS,,Australia,Australia,">100,000",multidecadal,'NOT RELEVANT',year,Simulated dynamics,2,2,2,,,Task 6.4 - targets and limits for indicators in an ecosystem context ,Other (Bioeconomic model),Other (bioeconomic model),Multi-stock (without species interactions),Grooved tiger prawn_Brown tiger prawn_endeavor prawn ,Other (Population dynamics model),Fleet not considered,,No,No spatial context,No,,Output control ,No,Economic,Profit,no,NOT RELEVANT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_0340,Sys,F.

We applied a Bayesian hierarchical DeLury depletion model to the Chinese jigging fisheries data to estimate the stock abundance and catchability for each year, and sensitivity analysis on daily natural mortality (M) was conducted. The results indicated that M values had great impacts on the overall estimates of stock size. Initial annual population sizes varied from 66 to 662 million individuals with the M value of 0.003-0.01 per day during the study period. O. bartramii suffered from a certain degree of overexploitation in 2008. The proportional escapement values (M=0.003-0.01) were 8.94% to 19.82% in 2008, with an average of 13.74%, which may have led to a low abundance of O. bartramii and annual catch since 2009. As short-lived ecological opportunists, O. bartramii are extremely sensitive to changes in multi-scale environmental conditions, especially when anomalous environmental conditions occur, and significant between-year variations in the initial abundance resulted in O. bartramii suffering from a certain degree of overexploitation in 2010. Although the proportional escapement met the management target of 40% from 2011 to 2015, the stock size and annual catch still fluctuated at relatively low levels. Improved knowledge of the influences of environmental conditions on abundance of the western winter-spring cohort of neon flying squid can contribute to the sustainable management of this stock. © 2019 CSIC.",English,Article,,Scopus,Not relevant to fisheries management evaluation models,,NA,,,,,,,,,,"stock assessment, no management simulation model",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_0343,Bitetto,"Diop, B; Blanchard, F; Sanz, N",Mangrove increases resiliency of the French Guiana shrimp fishery facing global warming,2018,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,387,,27,37,10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2018.08.014,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2018.08.014,"This paper deals with the biological, ecological and economic impact of global warming and mangrove habitat availability on the French Guiana shrimp fishery.

However, multi-objective management is now essential as fisheries have become recognised as complex social-ecological-systems. Policy and legislation demand a move towards quantitative approaches for reconciling multiple objectives and operationalising these within harvest strategies. We present a quantitative, non-commensurable-unit approach, via a multi-indicator value function with explicit objective preference weights.

Moreover, it allows the formal evaluation of performance across alternative stakeholder group preferences, providing an impartial way to obtain an overall optimum TAC.

The model is spatially implicit. The evaluation of the ecosystem is designed through the respect along time of constraints of both conservation and guaranteed captures. Using the mathematical concept of invariance kernel in a stochastic context, we define different MPA effects according to biodiversity catches or mixed points of view. Numerical simulations inspired from data of Abore coral reef reserve in New Caledonia illustrate the main concepts. In this case, it is pointed out how MPA conservation effect is not necessarily conflicting with MPA catches effect. it is shown that such a co-viability requires medium exploitation rate.

However, the way to operationalize this approach remains challenging. The present paper illustrates how the concepts of stochastic co-viability, which accounts for dynamic complexities, uncertainties, risk and sustainability constraints, can be useful for the implementation of EBFM. In the present case, this concept is used to identify fishing strategies that satisfy both ecological conservation and economic sustainability in a multi-species, multi-fleet context. Economic Viability Analysis (EVA) and the broader Co-Viability Analysis (CVA), are proposed to expand the usual Population Viability Analysis (PVA) and precautionary approach. An illustration is proposed, using data on the fisheries of Bay of Biscay (France) exploiting the stocks of nephrops and hake. Stochastic simulations show how CVA can guarantee both ecological (stock) and economic (profit) sustainability. Using 2008 as a baseline, the model is used to identify fishing efforts that ensure such co-viability. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,,Scopus,,Bay of Biscay (France),Europe,">100,000",multidecadal,NOT RELEVANT',year,Simulated dynamics,NOT RELEVANT',2,3,"Economic Viability Analysis (EVA) and the broader Co-Viability Analysis (CVA), are proposed to expand the usual Population Viability Analysis (PVA) and precautionary approach.

Since 1999, managers at the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, stakeholders, and scientists have been interested in developing ecological reference points (ERPs) that account for menhaden's role as a forage species. To accomplish this, we developed a suite of modeling approaches that incorporated predation on menhaden and changes in productivity over time and allowed for evaluation of trade-offs between menhaden harvest and ecosystem management objectives. These approaches ranged in complexity, from models with minimal data requirements and few assumptions to approaches with extensive data needs and detailed assumptions. This included a surplus production model with a time-varying intrinsic growth rate, a Steele-Henderson surplus production model, a multispecies statistical catch-at-age model, an Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) model with a limited predator and prey field, and a full EwE model. We evaluated how each model could address managers' objectives and compared outputs across the approaches, highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, and management utility. All models produced estimates of age-1 + biomass and exploitation rate that were similar in trend and magnitude to the single-species statistical catch-at-age model, especially in recent years. While the less complex models were relativity easy to implement and update, they lacked key elements needed to manage multiple species simultaneously. More complex models required a wider array of data and were more difficult to update within the current management time-frames, but produced a more useful framework for managers.

Here, we address the empirical evidence gap and further the ecological theory underpinning dynamic management. We illustrate, through the simulation of closures across a range of spatiotemporal scales, that dynamic ocean management can address previously intractable problems at scales associated with coactive and social patterns (e.g., competition, predation, niche partitioning, parasitism, and social aggregations). Furthermore, it can significantly improve the efficiency of management: as the resolution of the closures used increases (i.e., as the closures become more targeted), the percentage of target catch forgone or displaced decreases, the reduction ratio (bycatch/catch) increases, and the total time-area required to achieve the desired bycatch reduction decreases. In the scenario examined, coarser scale management measures (annual time-area closures and monthly full-fishery closures) would displace up to four to five times the target catch and require 100-200 times more square kilometer-days of closure than dynamic measures (grid-based closures and move-on rules).

This requires an understanding of ecological resilience: the ability of an ecosystem to return to the same state following a perturbation, which can strongly depend on species interactions across trophic levels. We use a structured model of a temperate rocky reef to explore how multi-trophic level fisheries impact ecological resilience. Increasing fishing mortality of prey (urchins) has a minor effect on equilibrium biomass of kelp, urchins, and spiny lobster predators, but increases resilience by reducing the range of predator harvest rates at which alternative stable states are possible. Size-structured predation on urchins acts as the feedback maintaining each state.

Invertebrates play important and diverse functional roles in marine ecosystems, yet the ecosystem effects of their exploitation are poorly understood. Using 12 ecosystem models distributed worldwide, we analysed the trade-offs of various invertebrate fisheries and their ecosystem effects as well as ecological indicators. Although less recognized for their contributions to marine food webs, our results show that the magnitude of trophic impacts of invertebrates on other species of commercial and conservation interest is comparable with those of forage fish. Generally, cephalopods showed the strongest ecosystem effects and were characterized by a strong top-down predatory role. Lobster, and to a lesser extent, crabs, shrimp and prawns, also showed strong ecosystem effects, but at lower trophic levels. Benthic invertebrates, including epifauna and infauna, also showed considerable ecosystem effects, but with strong bottom-up characteristics. In contrast, urchins, bivalves, and gastropods showed generally lower ecosystem effects in our simulations. Invertebrates also strongly contributed to benthic-pelagic coupling, with exploitation of benthic invertebrates impacting pelagic fishes and vice versa.

Using 70 y of data, we develop a bioeconomic model for Northeast Arctic cod to compare the economic yield in a model in which life-history traits can vary only through phenotypic plasticity with a model in which, in addition, genetic changes can occur. We find that evolutionary changes toward faster growth and earlier maturation occur consistently even if a stock is optimally managed. However, if a stock is managed optimally, the evolutionary changes actually increase economic yield because faster growth and earlier maturation raise the stock's productivity. The optimal fishing mortality is almost identical for the evolutionary and nonevolutionary model and substantially lower than what it has been historically. Therefore, the costs of ignoring evolution under optimal management regimes are negligible. However, if fishing mortality is as high as it has been historically, evolutionary changes may result in economic losses, but only if the fishery is selecting for medium-sized individuals. Because evolution facilitates growth, the fish are younger and still immature when they are susceptible to getting caught, which outweighs the increase in productivity due to fish spawning at an earlier age.",English,Article,"Green Accepted, Bronze, Green Published, Green Submitted",WOS,,NE Arctic,Arctic,">100,000",multidecadal,NOT RELEVANT',year,Simulated dynamics,NOT RELEVANT',2,2,"... our results show that the economic consequences of [fisheries induced evolution] are rather small, and mostly beneficial, largely because of the positive effects of fishing on growth.

Because bio-economic systems are intrinsically complex, previous efforts in this field have relied on a variety of simplifying assumptions. The model presented here relaxes some of these simplifications. Problems of tractability are surmounted by using the methodology of qualitative differential equations (QDE). The theory of QDEs takes into account that scientific knowledge about particular fisheries is usually limited, and facilitates an analysis of the global dynamics of systems with more than two ordinary differential equations.

Fishing may be an important evolutionary force that can change the distribution of fitness-related traits; however, the magnitude and direction of the evolutionary response may be influenced by different management strategies. Most phenotypic traits subject to human-induced selection are simultaneously influenced by the environment and by genetic variation, and many traits are genetically correlated. Here, we evaluated the evolutionary outcomes of harvest activities on mean length and age at maturity in a fish population by coupling a multivariate quantitative genetic model with a Leslie life history matrix model. Lengths-at-ages were treated as genetically correlated characters parameterized from empirical data on chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) populations. Using simulations, we explored the outcomes of 100 years of harvest using gill nets, which impose disruptive selection, or longlines, which impose minimum size selection, that targeted immature individuals in the high seas or maturing individuals in terminal spawning areas. Response in mean length and age depended on selection differentials imposed by harvest (which depended in turn on fishing location, gear type, and proportion of the population harvested) and on the genetic correlations between traits. Mean length was strongly influenced by the selection differential of the most abundant age class. Large differences in response were observed between the high-seas fishery, where the most abundant age was the youngest age vulnerable to harvest, compared to the terminal area fishery, where an older age class was most abundant. We observed a substantial difference in response between gill nets and longlines in the terminal fishery only. The evolution of mean age of mature individuals was less predictable, but generally increased as length decreased and decreased as length increased.

The agreement, therefore, implicitly builds on an expectation of the ecological condition of the natural resource. Game theoretical models often assume that all parties have the same (often perfect) information about the resource and that the exploitation is an equilibrium use of the stock. As stated by experts in natural science, the fish ecology still has many open questions, for example how to predict population dynamics, migration patterns, food availability, etc. In some cases, parties disagree about the state, abundance, and migration of a stock, which can reduce the possibilities of reaching an agreement for exploitation of the stock. This paper develops a model and applies it to the North-East Atlantic mackerel fishery, in order to analyze an IFA under different ecological scenarios, and also combines the model with the economic theory of entry deterrence. The model is used empirically to determine whether the parties with original access to the resource have an advantage when forming an agreement with a new party in having the ability to fish the stock down to a smaller size and thereby prevent another party from entering into the fishery. With a basis in entry deterrence, combined with lack of information, the paper illustrates the obstacles that have made an agreement for the North-East Atlantic mackerel so difficult to achieve. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,,Scopus,,NE Atlantic,Europe,">100,000",multidecadal,'NOT RELEVANT',year,Simulated dynamics,2,2,3,"The paper demonstrates how diverging views on the ecosystem can lead to the breaking down of management agreements.

The agreement, therefore, implicitly builds on an expectation of the ecological condition of the natural resource. Game theoretical models often assume that all parties have the same (often perfect) information about the resource and that the exploitation is an equilibrium use of the stock. As stated by experts in natural science, the fish ecology still has many open questions, for example how to predict population dynamics, migration patterns, food availability, etc. In some cases, parties disagree about the state, abundance, and migration of a stock, which can reduce the possibilities of reaching an agreement for exploitation of the stock. This paper develops a model and applies it to the North-East Atlantic mackerel fishery, in order to analyze an IFA under different ecological scenarios, and also combines the model with the economic theory of entry deterrence. The model is used empirically to determine whether the parties with original access to the resource have an advantage when forming an agreement with a new party in having the ability to fish the stock down to a smaller size and thereby prevent another party from entering into the fishery.

However, climate variability and anthropogenic climate change may seriously impact small-scale fisheries by altering the abundance and distribution of target species. Social relationships between fishery users, such as fish traders, can determine how each individual responds and is affected by changes in fisheries. These informal cooperative and competitive relationships provide access, support, and incentives for fishing and affect the distribution of benefits. Yet, individuals' actions and impacts on individuals are often the primary focus of the economic analyses informing small-scale fisheries' formal management. This focus dismisses relevant social relationships. We argue that this leads to a disconnect between reality and its model representation used in formal management, which may reduce formal fisheries management's efficiency and efficacy and potentially trigger adverse consequences. Here, we examine this argument by comparing the predictions of a simple bioeconomic fishery model with those of a social-ecological model that incorporates the dynamics of cooperative relationships between fish traders. We illustrate model outcomes using an empirical case study in the Mexican Humboldt squid fishery. We find that (1) the social-ecological model with relationship dynamics substantially improves accuracy in predicting observed fishery variables to the simple bioeconomic model. (2) Income inequality outcomes are associated with changes in cooperative trade relationships. When environmental temperature is included in the model as a driver of species production dynamics, we find that climate-driven temperature variability drives a decline in catch that, in turn, reduce fishers' income. We observe an offset of this loss in income by including cooperative relationships between fish traders (oligopoly) in the model. These relationships break down following species distribution changes and result in an increase in prices fishers receive. Finally, (3) our social-ecological model simulations show that the current fishery development program, which seeks to increase fishers' income through an increase in domestic market demand, is supported by predictions from the simple bioeconomic model, may increase income inequality between fishers and traders.

Economic approaches have the potential to assist fisheries to bridge this gap, such as bio-economic models that combine biology with fishing costs to evaluate the economic performance of a broad range of management measures. Economic objectives are prevalent in overarching Australian fisheries legislation, however economic data is often not collected and economic analyses or instruments not broadly applied. This paper reviews selected Australian fisheries to demonstrate the accrued economic benefits from applying formal bio-economic models and conducting empirical analyses of the impact of supply on product value. Challenges to the implementation and continued use of economic analyses and instruments are discussed including: (i) short-term transition costs and associated trade-offs between ecological, economic, social and political objectives; (ii) scarce logistical and financial capacity to collect and analyse economic data; (iii) a lack of desire among industry to change and transition to economic targets such as maximum economic yield (MEY), particularly when it is associated with lower catches; and (iv) a lack of economic literacy among fisheries managers and industry. It is contended that many of these challenges initially arise from an absence of clearly identified and prioritised objectives within overarching legislation and management plans.

In particular, fisheries-targeting forage fish (small and abundant pelagic fish) might have a detrimental effect on fisheries-targeting predators that consume them. However, complexities in ecological interactions might dampen, negate, or even reverse this trade-off, because small pelagic fish can be important predators on egg stages of piscivorous fish. Further, the strength of this trade-off might depend on the extent to which piscivorous fish targeted by fisheries regulate forage species productivity. Here, we developed a novel delay-differential bioeconomic model of predator-prey and fishing dynamics to quantify how much egg predation or weak top-town control affects the strength of trade-off between forage and piscivore fisheries, and to measure how ecological interactions dictate policies that maximize steady-state profits. We parameterized the model based on ecological and economic data from the North Sea Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus). The optimal policy was very sensitive to the ecological interactions (either egg predation or weak top-down control of forage by predators) at relatively low forage prices but was less sensitive at high forage fish prices. However, the optimal equilibrium harvest rates on forage and piscivores were not substantially different from what might be derived through analyses that did not consider species interactions. Applying the optimal multispecies policy would produce substantial losses (>25%) in profits in the piscivore fishery, and the extent of loss was sensitive to ecological scenarios.

We used a guild based multispecies simulation model of the Georges Bank finfish community to quantify tradeoffs and changes among values for proposed ecological indicators given alternative fishing scenarios, and tested the performance of indicator-based approaches for setting system ceilings on annual catches. Values for ecosystem indicators were sensitive to the exploitation rates on guilds, with total biomass of the community being most sensitive to groundfish exploitation rate. Setting ceilings on system-wide annual catches was successful in constraining values for indicators and revealed levels of system catch associated with indicator change. Community composition indicators showed catch thresholds lower than provided by the total biomass indicator. Ceilings based on community composition indicators more frequently resulted in higher yields and fewer species being overfished than when ceilings were set using total biomass or when no ceiling was in place. Simulations demonstrated that threshold values in ecosystem indicators could be used to determine reference points in an EBFM context.

We place particular interest on Hilsa shad (Tenualosa ilisha), which accounts for ca. 11% of total catches, and Bombay duck (Harpadon nehereus), a low price fish that is the second highest catch in Bangladesh and is highly consumed by low-income communities. It is concluded that the impacts of climate change, under greenhouse emissions scenario A1B, are likely to reduce the potential fish production in the Bangladesh exclusive economic zone by <10%. However, these impacts are larger for the two target species. Under sustainable management practices, we expect Hilsa shad catches to show a minor decline in potential catch by 2030 but a significant (25%) decline by 2060. However, if over exploitation is allowed, catches are projected to fall much further, by almost 95% by 2060, compared with the Business as Usual scenario for the start of the 21st century. For Bombay duck, potential catches by 2060 under sustainable scenarios will produce a decline of,20% compared with current catches.

To assist with these initiatives, one of the qualitative risk assessment methods adapted for fisheries management over a decade ago has been reviewed. This method was updated to ensure compliance with the revised international standards for risk management (ISO 31000) and to enable consideration of ecological, economic, social, and governance risks. The review also addressed the difficulties that have been encountered in stakeholder understanding of the underlying concepts and to increase the discipline in its application. The updates include simplifying the number of consequence and likelihood levels, adopting graphical techniques to represent different consequence levels, and discussing how changes in uncertainty can affect risk scores. Adopting an explicit weight of evidence"" approach has also assisted with determining which consequence scenarios are considered plausible and, where relevant, their specific likelihoods. The revised methods therefore incorporate the conceptual elements from a number of qualitative and quantitative approaches increasing their reliability and enabling a more seamless transition along this spectrum as more lines of evidence are collected. It is expected that with continued application of these methods, further refinements will be identified. ©International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2014.

Several types of impacts are incorporated including mortality, competition, and disturbance effects at different spatial scales exemplifying fisheries effects on benthic communities, marine mammals, and birds. Fisheries sectors analyzed are beam trawlers, demersal otter trawlers, gillnet, and sandeel fisheries in the German Exclusive Economic Zone of the North Sea. The basic ecological unit to which the risk score applies is the population/stock level or the distribution range of a community. The risk function comprises an exposure term and the loss function. The loss function is driven by a relative term, that is, the ratio between negative potential, that is, decline or mortality, and positive potential, that is, recovery. Sensitivity analysis is carried out to indicate model precision and its capabilities to distinguish between high and low risk areas and impacts. Limit reference values important for characterization of relative ecological risk are analytically defined. Model parameterization is based on literature review, and calculated examples show that beam trawling appears as a strong risk component to benthic communities, likely to exceed the limit reference value.

Pragmatic ways to assess and address the impact of nonselective fishing practices on small fishes need to be found, especially given the limited knowledge of their life histories, population dynamics, and ecology. The use of matrix models for understanding and mitigating such impacts is explored using a small fish, Stellifer illecebrosus (silver stardrum) in the southern Gulf of California, Mexico, as a case study. A deterministic matrix model, populated with vital rates generated through six months of fisheries-dependent sampling, was used to estimate the rate of population growth for the species, conduct elasticity analyses to see which vital rates have greatest relative effects on population growth, test the sensitivity of model outcomes to uncertainties in life history parameters, mortality rates and the number of age classes modelled, and explore potential mitigation tools. Despite great uncertainty regarding the impact of industrial shrimp trawling on S. illecebrosus, principally due to uncertainty in mortality rates but also in other life history parameters, the matrix model was still useful in indicating that any precautionary management should focus on increasing the survival of younger age classes. This could be achieved with trawl closures where smaller fish live. The study demonstrates the importance of understanding age-based changes in vital rates to the predictions of matrix models; estimated population growth rates were most uncertain when all mature individuals were assumed to contribute equally to recruitment. But nevertheless, the study supports claims that deterministic matrix models may be useful for conservation and management where life history parameters can only be estimated crudely. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",English,Article,No,Scopus,Not relevant to fisheries management evaluation models,southern Gulf of California,North America,">100,000",'NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT',Fisheries Dependent Data,'NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT',2,Precautionary management should focus on increasing the survival of younger age classes.

Dynamic simulations were based on a spatial ecological model previously calibrated with time series of data. Scenarios regarding spatial management were evaluated with the establishment of two marine protected areas, respectively, in the Pomo pit and the northern region. In addition, three temporal simulations of temporary closures and overall reduction of fishing effort of demersal and pelagic fleets (bottom, mid-water trawls and purse seines) were also considered. Simulations were run for 45 years (1975-2020), including the calibration period (1975-2002), and changes in biomass and catch of marine resources were analyzed. Our results confirm that current fishing management in the Adriatic Sea does not have clear beneficial impacts for the recovery of exploited resources, which will remain depleted in 2020 if business as usual continues. Simulations of alternative management suggest that both protected areas could be beneficial for fish population recovery predicting an increase in the biomass of commercial fish and predatory organisms. Simulations of temporary closures and overall reduction of fishing effort also show significant benefits for several commercial resources. We argue that both management measures may be effective tools to recover exploited ecosystems of the Northern-Central Adriatic Sea and halt the decline of marine resources. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The interdecadal variability is characterized by periods of high and low abundance, termed pseudo-cycles"", because of their irregular periodicity. Fisheries targeting small pelagic fish suffer from overall overcapitalization, like many other fisheries, but also from an additional overcapitalization problem: a phase displacement between rapid fish population decreases and a slower disinvestment which follows. This lag produces economic hardship. Here we document the fish:fishery relationship for the Peruvian anchoveta. Anchoveta pseudo-cycles of 20 to >100 years are observed, with the present stock abundance most likely located near upper part of the cycle. Fleet overcapacity expressed as the proportion of unused present capacity is estimated at 72% and processing overcapacity at 89%. A simple bio-economic model demonstrates the risks associated with the pseudo-periodicity in fish stock abundance in conjunction with fishery investment, open access, and overcapacity: a timing bomb for the fishing sector. The lag between disinvestment and decrease in fish abundance is quantified. A reduction of the fishing and processing capacity and measures to decrease the investment lag are recommended to limit the social, economical and political tensions that will result from the expected decrease in stock abundance. Finally, some management options to reduce these risks are discussed. © 2008.""",English,Article,,Scopus,,Peru,South America,">100,000",multidecadal,'NOT RELEVANT',year,Simulated dynamics,'NOT RELEVANT',2,2,,,Task 6.5 - management strategies,Other (Bioeconomic model),Other (bioeconomic model),Single stock,Anchoveta,abundance aggregated,Fleet not considered,,Yes,No spatial context,No,,No management measures,No,Other (Fleet-based),Holding capacity of the fleet,no,NOT RELEVANT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_0431,BIOR,M.

For example, fisheries managers may forgo opportunities to sustainably harvest abundant populations to reduce risks to less productive populations. Increasing the stock selectivity of fisheries is one management lever that may allow for both conservation- and catch-based objectives to be met. We developed a model that simulates the dynamics of a Pacific salmon stock aggregate and its fishery to evaluate how changing allocations between mixed- and single-stock fisheries influences management performance. We focused on relatively generic management strategies that may be implemented in a range of salmon fisheries. Additionally, we examined how the relative performance of mixed- and single-stock fisheries may change under alternative ecological and management scenarios. We found that increasing single-stock fishery allocations increased aggregate abundance and improved the status of some stocks relative to their conservation benchmarks. However, these improvements did not occur uniformly-relatively abundant, productive stocks exhibited no change, or even declines, in conservation performance as single-stock fishery allocations increased.

We first collected information on life history of 10 commercial Atlantic species and then compared this information using multivariate analysis. On one hand, tropical tunas are characterised by small to medium size, rapid growth, early age-at-maturity, long spawning duration and short life span. These species, therefore, display a rapid turnover, characteristic of r-selected species. On the other hand, temperate tunas display differing life history traits, i.e., large size, slow growth, late age-at-maturity, short spawning duration and long life span. The turnover of these species is slow and present characteristics similar to 'K-selected' species (with a conservative strategy adapted to a colder and more variable environment). We, then, selected the two tuna species displaying the most contrasting life histories, i.e., skipjack (SKJ) and bluefin tuna (BFT), and investigated their respective responses to various levels of exploitation, using simulation modelling. If fishing activity starts at age 1 (a situation which is close to the actual exploitation pattern), differences in life history traits make the BFT population much more fragile to exploitation and less productive than SKJ. However, if the fisheries only target adults, both SKJ and BFT populations are able to sustain high F. Spawning stocks and yields of BFT also display conspicuous long-term fluctuations, resulting from the combination of year-to-year variations in the recruitment and a long life span. This variability makes it difficult to detect overfishing or depletion risks in the BFT population. Because of its short life span, SKJ does not display such long-term variations in its SSB. Our simulations also showed that current management measures based on a minimum size limit are much more critical for BFT than SKJ. This difference stresses the importance of taking account of differences in life history traits into management measures. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Complex simulation models contain a number of details that make them suitable for practical management advice, including taking into account the response of the fishermen to implemented management measures. To demonstrate the use of complex management models this paper assesses a number of second best management schemes against a first rank optimum (FRO), an ideal individual transferable quotas (ITQ) system. This is defined as the management scheme which produces the highest net present value over a 25 year period. The assessed management schemes (scenarios) are composed by several measures as used in the Common Fisheries Policy of the European Union for the cod fishery in the Baltic Sea. The scenarios are total allowable catches in combination with entry restrictions, and maximum number of days at sea in combination with entry restrictions. These two scenarios are assessed under assumptions of no cooperative behavior and cooperative behavior, and compliance and noncompliance with various management restrictions. Apart from showing the magnitude of the resource rent, the impact on fleet structure and the adjustment paths is shown. The result is that the resource rent gained from these second best management schemes is lower than FRO, the ideal ITQ system, but may in practice not be so different.

Integrating disparate datasets (including old and new knowledge) is a challenge for any location, but is increasingly important given the expansion of the marine industries constituting the blue economy. This is particularly so when industries operate in frontier, or remote regions with high conservation significance. Ecosystem models are an integration tool that can give insight into the structure and function of marine systems and act as a testbed for exploring scenarios of development for the region. Two of the most widely used ecosystem models (Atlantis and Ecopath with Ecosim) were implemented for the GAB, to allow an exploration of development scenarios and to provide tools in support of future management of the GAB's socioecological systems. The models were used to evaluate the vulnerability of key species, food webs, habitats and animal groupings to ecosystem stressors such as climate change, fisheries, disease, changing spatial management, aquaculture and oil spills. The models' responses to cessation of fishing indicate that the anthropogenic signature is not 'untouched', but is not yet substantially degraded. The complexity and confined area of much of the natural and anthropogenic activity in the region, which is highly concentrated in the gulfs and along the shoreline, means the system is sufficiently interlinked for cumulative nonlinear outcomes to occur if the system is sufficiently stressed. Scenarios of increased fishing pressure had the greatest impacts on individual functional groups, while scenarios of ocean warming had the greatest influence on ecosystem structure and integrity. Oil spill scenarios (e.g. caused by potential off-shore shipping accidents) had potential impacts on seabirds, pelagic fishes and marine mammals, with flow-on effects to the whole ecosystem, but only in a confined area immediately around the incident's footprint.

Integrating disparate datasets (including old and new knowledge) is a challenge for any location, but is increasingly important given the expansion of the marine industries constituting the blue economy. This is particularly so when industries operate in frontier, or remote regions with high conservation significance. Ecosystem models are an integration tool that can give insight into the structure and function of marine systems and act as a testbed for exploring scenarios of development for the region. Two of the most widely used ecosystem models (Atlantis and Ecopath with Ecosim) were implemented for the GAB, to allow an exploration of development scenarios and to provide tools in support of future management of the GAB's socioecological systems. The models were used to evaluate the vulnerability of key species, food webs, habitats and animal groupings to ecosystem stressors such as climate change, fisheries, disease, changing spatial management, aquaculture and oil spills. The models' responses to cessation of fishing indicate that the anthropogenic signature is not 'untouched', but is not yet substantially degraded. The complexity and confined area of much of the natural and anthropogenic activity in the region, which is highly concentrated in the gulfs and along the shoreline, means the system is sufficiently interlinked for cumulative nonlinear outcomes to occur if the system is sufficiently stressed. Scenarios of increased fishing pressure had the greatest impacts on individual functional groups, while scenarios of ocean warming had the greatest influence on ecosystem structure and integrity. Oil spill scenarios (e.g. caused by potential off-shore shipping accidents) had potential impacts on seabirds, pelagic fishes and marine mammals, with flow-on effects to the whole ecosystem, but only in a confined area immediately around the incident's footprint.

We explored functional response parameter uncertainty and its effect on fishing simulation results using a dynamic food web model of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) with14 fishing fleets, 104 consumer groups, four primary producer groups, and five detritus pools. After generating millions of potential ecosystems with randomly selected functional response parameters, we assigned groups of these randomly parameterized systems to one of five increasingly intense ecosystem-wide fishing treatments. For each fishing treatment, we counted and compared resulting ecosystems with no extinctions. Surprisingly, the model GOA ecosystems were robust to a wide range of functional response parameters. However, we found an abrupt threshold effect between moderate and heavy exploitation rates, beyond which a much lower proportion of model ecosystems persisted. Beyond this fishing threshold, extinction was more likely, and system attributes differed greatly from moderately fished model ecosystems.

Second, and importantly, we found a clear threshold effect beyond which fishing fundamentally constrains the resilience of the ecosystem that was absent using default functional response parameters, and this threshold is a nonlinear function of fishing effort. Third, we found a small set of species groups in the GOA with less tolerance to variation in functional response parameters, and this set expanded under heavy fishing, suggesting that the status of these ÒsensitiveÓ groups might indicate fishery sustainability at the ecosystem level.

We loosely modeled the Northeast US Large Marine Ecosystem fish community, exploring a range of harvest, ecological interactions (competition and predation), and climate effects scenarios. We examined the independent effects of each of the triad of drivers at their base levels on the 3 main functional groups. We then explored the effects of targeted harvest on specific functional groups as well as different levels of total system harvest, both with and without climate effects. Our results indicate that the triad of drivers can lead to unanticipated, indirect effects on groups of species, and that all 3 should be taken into account by an operating model in a Management Strategy Evaluation context. Harvest tends to affect groups with a slower overall growth rate the most, while groups affected by strong ecological interactions often exhibit strong competitive or predatory release when other groups are reduced in biomass.

The system consists of two main components: an integrated agent-based model for simulating recreational fishing behavior and reef ecosystem dynamics; and an evaluation model based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) together with a technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). The evaluation component is responsible for assessing alternative strategies based on the simulation outputs generated by the former.

The identification of best management options is technically challenging because of the lack of scientific tools to inform resource managers of future responses/impacts of these different options. This paper proposes a decision support system which aims at greatly improving stakeholder dialogue and decision making. The system consists of two main components: an integrated agent-based model for simulating recreational fishing behavior and reef ecosystem dynamics; and an evaluation model based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) together with a technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). The evaluation component is responsible for assessing alternative strategies based on the simulation outputs generated by the former. We apply the proposed system to the assessment of management strategies for recreational fishing in the Ningaloo Marine Park, an iconic coral reef system in Western Australia. A set of management strategies, including a business-as-usual strategy and six alternative site closure strategies are assessed using the proposed solution. The site closure strategies evaluated vary in length and number of popular sites closed. The evaluation results illustrate the usefulness of the proposed system in tackling complex management choices. We also perform a sensitivity analysis on the stakeholder or decision maker outcome preference weights and provide measures for assessing the sensitivity of strategy ranking outcomes to changes in these weights.

In total, 45 functional groups considering all components of the food web (fish, marine mammals, seabirds, invertebrates, primary producers, and detritus) were selected to build the ecological model. The fishery was represented by the four main fleets operating in the area (i.e., bottom trawl, purse seine, longlines, and small-scale fisheries) and we included official landing data and estimated percentage of discarded species. Results were then compared with available outputs of available models representing adjacent ecosystems such as the Gulf of Cadiz (in the Atlantic side) and the North Western Mediterranean Sea (north of the study area). The study revealed that the major differences found between models were due to the lower primary production in the GoA. This led to lower catches and higher importance of the demersal compartment, where the most biomass was associated to the detritus. The main trophic flows in the GoA were originated at the basis of the food web, likely related to bottom-up flow control. Interactions between pelagic and demersal groups were weaker than in neighboring areas. Despite the high values of ecotrophic efficiencies and mortality rates, results showed a lower fishing pressure than in neighboring areas, suggesting a moderate exploitation level of marine resources in the GoA.

The core of the approach is to expose an ensemble of models with different ecological assumptions to climate forcing, using multiple realizations of each climate scenario. We simulated the long-term response of cod to future fishing and climate change in seven ecological models ranging from single-species to food web models. These models were analyzed using the ""biological ensemble modeling approach"" by which we (1) identified a key ecological mechanism explaining the differences in simulated cod responses between models, (2) disentangled the uncertainty caused by differences in ecological model assumptions from the statistical uncertainty of future climate, and (3) identified results common for the whole model ensemble. Species interactions greatly influenced the simulated response of cod to fishing and climate, as well as the degree to which the statistical uncertainty of climate trajectories carried through to uncertainty of cod responses. Models ignoring the feedback from prey on cod showed large interannual fluctuations in cod dynamics and were more sensitive to the underlying uncertainty of climate forcing than models accounting for such stabilizing predator-prey feedbacks. Yet in all models, intense fishing prevented recovery, and climate change further decreased the cod population.

Originally, the LML was to be reduced in slow growth southern areas only; however, the change was implemented across the entire fishery due to lobbying by commercial fishers. The lower LML has been controversial ever since, including during recent years when low recruitment resulted in a lower total allowable catch (TAC). Fishers argued that this could have been prevented with a higher female LML across the jurisdiction. A length- and sex-based bioeconomic model was used to examine probable outcomes of the larger statewide LML. This model showed that management of egg production would be poorly served by raising the statewide LML because of spatial patterns in the stock and fishery. Catch would be displaced from areas where egg production was already high and into the most depleted areas thus reducing production in areas of greatest concern. Spatial variation in biological parameters can have a profound effect on outcomes of management perceived to be conservative, possibly leading to negative impacts. This risk exists wherever catch is displaced, such as with Marine Protected Areas, spatial TACs and gear restrictions. © 2014 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2014.

The economic feasibility of these operations was examined for translocations by either charter vessels or by fishers retaining their sub-legal catch and releasing these on their return trip to port. Benefit was quantified by the increase in revenue relative to leaving lobsters at their original site, less cost for translocating lobsters. Scenarios were considered feasible when costs per kg gain in yield were below that for quota leased through the market. Lower cost fisher translocations appeared feasible except for short distance translocations from deep to shallow water in the same region. Greatest net benefit occurred from long distance translocations between regions with extreme differences in growth (from SW to NW Tasmania). These operations required vessel charter and led to a net state benefit of Australian169,000 per 5-tonne trip, with internal rates of return approaching 400%. Cost per kg gain in catch for these operations was estimated at less than A3/kg and thus substantially less than the current lease price of around A16/kg.

Multispecies virtual population analysis (MSVPA) is an approach to quantifying predator-prey interactions and estimating the rates of predation mortality for exploited fish populations. Here, an extended MSVPA (MSVPA-X) is presented as an alternative to existing MSVPA approaches. Notably, MSVPA-X uses index-tuned VPA methods, applies a more flexible feeding model, and includes an alternative functional feeding response. The MSVPA-X model is applied to a western Atlantic fish community, focusing on Atlantic menhaden and its major fish predators, and a sensitivity analysis of major model parameters is presented. The sensitivity analysis highlights the need for adequate diet sampling. The MSVPA-X represents an improvement over previous approaches by increasing the flexibility to model seasonal and interannual dynamics in the strength of predator-prey interactions. Model results demonstrate that, for menhaden in particular, and forage fish in general, quantifying predation mortality is an important part of effective assessments of forage fish, their predators, and the fisheries of both. © 2009 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

We describe a comparative multi-fleet analysis of socio-economic indicators applicable for inclusion into ecosystem modeling and management. Based on a survey of different industrial fishing fleets in SS Paulo, Southeastern Brazil, an inter-fleet comparison of economic attributes such as investment, fixed costs, effort, labour, sailing-related costs and profits, as well as a set of performance indicators, was conducted. Costs varied between fleets with fuel being the largest component on average, representing almost 37% of total costs. Similarities between fleets were driven by fuel costs, gross incomes and profits. In general, the best economic performance was associated with indicators of profitability and economic efficiency. Bottom-longliners and both surface and bottom-gillnet fleets showed the best economic performance per fishing trip due to their low percentage of variable costs. Purse-seiners and pink-shrimp trawlers had the lowest average rate of return and economic efficiency because of their high variable costs and relatively low catch values, and were considered economically net losers. However, in terms of jobs generated, purse-seiners had the greatest value creating about 49% of total jobs by all fleets. The sea-bob-shrimp fleet had the lowest crew size per vessel but generated the second highest total number of direct jobs (23%), with high economic viability as a whole. The inter-fleet cost and socio-economic performance analysis revealed that additional attention should be given to the poor profitability and overcapacity of fleets, fishing impacts, and open-access related issues, while social indicators may also be considered. This study provides information useful for evaluating different fisheries management scenarios and fleet size optimization in the South Brazil Bight, for ecosystem modeling policy optimization routines, and for a pragmatic ecosystem approach to fisheries management.

Based on fisheries information and on previous models, 25 species groups were defined. The mean trophic level of all fisheries was 2.99 with small trawlers and the live baitfish fleet occupying the lowest trophic levels. The change in squid fishing rate and the most important squid predators fishing rate were simulated by increasing fishing mortality (F) from 0 to 1 per year, while maintaining F constant for other exploited groups. Also, the impact of fishing pressure by trawlers on squids and by the live baitfish fleet on young sardines were simulated. Different hypotheses of flow control were tested by setting the maximum instantaneous mortality rate that consumers could exert on food resources by (a) top-down control by predators (predator control); (b) all interactions of mixed control type; and (c) bottom-up control of predators by their prey (donor control). For squid, predicted biomass changes were more pronounced under top-down control that under bottom-up. Biomass of the weakfish, which are important squid predators, were the most affected under all hypotheses. A similar pattern of decrease in other squid predators was seen. The ecosystem consequence of overexploiting weakfish and large pelagic fish biomass was speculated regarding the increasing squid catches. Simulations of increasing live-baitfish fleet did not show prominent impact in the inner shelf, where present F values are low. Given young sardines concentrate in shallow waters, where the conflicts converge, a complementary model of the adjacent coastal system and artisanal fisheries could better address fleet's impact. Nevertheless, it was noted a decrease of sharks and rays reflecting their vulnerability in the system. A precautionary measure for fisheries management in the region would be to assume that top-down control is a dominant force in energy flows, differing from the custom emphasis placed only in environmental forces and productivity. The ecosystem approach will require the integration of information from a wide range of disciplines, levels of ecological organization and temporal and spatial scales, as well as concrete management measures.

Among these systems, marine ecosystems have high uncertainties: marine populations in general are known to exhibit large levels of natural variability and the intensity of fishing efforts can change rapidly. These uncertainties are a source of risks that threaten the sustainability of both fish populations and fishing fleets targeting them. Appropriate management measures have to be found in order to reduce these risks and decrease sensitivity to uncertainties. Methods have been developed within decision theory that aim at allowing decision making under severe uncertainty. One of these methods is the information-gap decision theory. The info-gap method has started to permeate ecological modelling, with recent applications to conservation. However, these practical applications have so far been restricted to simple models with analytical solutions.

Thus, we show that the ecosystem biomass present at a given trophic level may be estimated from two simple equations, one describing biomass flow, the other their kinetics (which quantifies the velocity of biomass transfers towards top predators). The flow kinetic of prey partly depends on the abundance of their predators, and a top-down equation expressing this is included in the model. Based on these relationships, we simulated the impact on a virtual ecosystem of various exploitation patterns. Specifically, we show that the EcoTroph approach is able to mimic the effects of increased fishing effort on ecosystem biomass expected from theory. Particularly, the model exhibits complex patterns observed in field data, notably cascading effects and 'fishing down the food web'. EcoTroph also provides diagnostic tools for examining the relationships between catch and fishing effort at the ecosystem scale and the effects of strong top-down controls and fast-flow kinetics on ecosystems resilience. Finally, a dynamic version of the model is derived from the steady-state version, thus allowing simulations of time series of ecosystem biomass and catches. Using this dynamic model, we explore the propagation of environmental variability in the food web, and illustrated how exploitation can induce a decrease of ecosystem stability. The potential for applying EcoTroph to specific ecosystems, based on field data, and similarities between EcoTroph and Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) are finally discussed. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The second basic assumption is that the kinetics of the biomass flow is characterized by faster transfers at low trophic levels, due to the higher metabolism rate of the animals therein.

Gulf menhaden, Brevoortia patronus, support the largest fishery in the Gulf (by weight) and provide forage for marine mammals, seabirds and commercially and recreationally important fish species. Understanding the complex interactions among multiple fisheries and myriad unfished species requires tools different from those used in traditional single-species management. One such tool, Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) is increasingly being used to construct food web models of aquatic ecosystems and to evaluate fisheries management options within a broader, ecosystem context. Here, an EwE model was developed to examine the impact of Gulf fisheries on ecosystem structure and maturity. This model builds on previously published EwE models of the GoM, and is tailored to the range and habitat of Gulf menhaden. The model presented here consists of 47 functional groups, including 4 seabird groups, 1 marine mammal group, 3 elasmobranch groups, 26 bony fish groups, 9 invertebrate groups, 3 primary producer groups and 1 detritus group. A number of different management scenarios for Gulf fisheries were modeled and the results were evaluated in terms of impacts on ecosystem maturity and development. The results of the model simulations indicated that the northern Gulf of Mexico is in an immature state (sensu Odum, 1969). Management scenarios that increased fishing pressure over time consistently resulted in a decrease in the maturity indices. In particular, we found that Gulf menhaden, as a key forage fish in the ecosystem, plays a substantial role in the structure and functioning of the ecosystem. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Bycatch mortality from fisheries is clearly among the most serious global threats for marine ecosystems, affecting a wide range of top predators. Recent estimates report ca. 200,000 seabirds killed annually by bycatch in European waters. However, there is an urgent need to rigorously estimate actual mortality rates and quantify effects of bycatch on populations. The Mediterranean Sea is one of the most impacted regions. Here, we estimate for the first time both bycatch mortality rates and their population-level effects on three endemic and vulnerable Mediterranean taxa: Scopoli's shearwater, Mediterranean shag, and Audouin's gull, that die in different types of fishing gears: longlines, gillnets and sport trolling, respectively. We use multi-event capture-recapture modelling to estimate crucial demographic parameters, including the probabilities of dying in different fishing gears. We then build stochastic demography models to forecast the viability of the populations under different management scenarios. Longline bycatch was particularly severe for adults of Scopoli's shearwaters and Audouin's gulls (ca. 28% and 23% of total mortality, respectively) and also for immature gulls (ca. 90% of mortality). Gillnets had a lower impact, but were still responsible for ca. 9% of juvenile mortality on shags, whereas sport trolling only slightly influenced total mortality in gulls. Bycatch mortality has high population-level impacts in all three species, with shearwaters having the highest extinction risk under current mortality rates. Different life-history traits and compensatory demographic mechanisms between the three species are probably influencing the different bycatch impact: for shearwaters, urgent conservation actions are required to ensure the viability of their populations.

The indicators translate the general descriptors of ecological quality in the directives into a single value of ecological status by combining indices of species diversity, species sensitivity and density. Studies and inter-calibration exercises have shown that the indicators respond to chemical pollution and organic enrichment, but little is known about their response to bottom trawling. We use linear mixed effects models to analyze how bottom trawling intensity affects the indicators used in the Danish (Danish Quality Index, DKI) and Swedish (Benthic Quality Index, BQI) environmental monitoring programs in the Kattegat, the sea area between Sweden and Denmark. Using year and station as random variables and trawling intensity, habitat type, salinity and depth as fixed variables we find a significant negative relationship between the BQI indicator and bottom trawling, while the DKI is related significantly to salinity, but not to trawling intensity. Among the indicator components, the species diversity and sensitivity indices used in the DKI are not significantly linked to trawling, and trawling only affects the BQI when species sensitivities are derived from rarefied samples. Because the number of species recorded per sample (species density) is limited by the number of individuals per sample (density), we expect species density and density to be positively correlated. This correlation was confirmed by a simulation model and by statistical analysis of the bottom samples in which log species density was highly significantly related to log density (rÊ=Ê0.75, dfÊ=Ê144, pÊ<Ê0.001). Without accounting for the effect of density on species density, indicators based on species density will be affected by temporal and spatial variations in density linked e.g. to variable recruitment success.

This system was put in place after years of declining stocks and over investment. In this paper we describe this reform and estimate related allocative efficiency benefits for the most important industrial fishery in the country, the southern pelagic fishery. Benefits were estimated using a bioeconomic model estimated using data for the 1985-2004 period. The estimated model was then used to generate simulated scenarios of the evolution of this fishery in a 20 year horizon with and without the ITQ system in place. The benefits of the reform can then be estimated by comparing the fishery's costs in the scenarios with and without ITQs. This approach allows benefits to be estimated using more realistic counterfactual scenarios than just comparing the fishery before and after the reform. Estimated discounted net benefits reach US $166 million in the period 2001-2020. Fleet size fell from 149 active boats in 2000 to 57 in 2004 as a direct consequence of the reform. Among the interesting features of the Chilean experience is the way the political economy of the reform was facilitated by the prior introduction of de facto individual quotas within the framework of fishery experimental activities. When the authorities closed the southern pelagic fishery because of biological problems between 1997 and 2000, they organized 'experimental' fishing expeditions in which participant boats were given the right to fish a certain amount of resources per expedition. This pseudo quota system allowed fishermen to experience directly the benefits of individual quotas and that was instrumental to the political agreement leading to the reform.

In this system the primary productivity and benthic invertebrates are more important in the cycling of biomass. The models were built with a similar number of compartments for the years 1992, 2002 and 2012, using Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE). Odum and Ulanowicz's frameworks and ecological network analysis were then used to estimate the levels of maturity, growth and development of the system. Likewise, keystoneness indexes - at each time - were also estimated for the models. Our results show that Tongoy Bay exhibited an increase in maturity and development (health) in 2012 compared to past conditions, which was reflected by (1) an increase in the total system biomass, total system throughput, AMI, and absolute Ascendency, (2) higher flow and increased efficiency of transferred energy and its proportion at higher trophic levels, (3) an increase of recycling (FCI), (4) a reduction of NPP/R and NPP/B ratios of the system, and (5) an increase in the number of compartments trophically linked that comprise the keystone species complex. We argue that these results are a consequence of reduced fishing pressure on this benthic system in recent years.

It is estimated that at the current fishing mortality rate the spawning biomass per-recruit for females is 16% and that of males is 27%, indicating that the fishery is overfished, with a high chance of recruitment failure in the future. A number of management scenarios, based on minimum size limits and closed seasons were evaluated for this fishery in order to determine which of the scenarios would increase spawning biomass per-recruit without compromising yield per-recruit harvest rates to levels which may lead to socio-economic hardship amongst fishers. It has been shown that closed seasons and minimum size limits may be the most effective current means of achieving these objectives and it is proposed that a closed season, coupled with a minimum size of 45 cm (FL) for both sexes, be implemented each year from the 1 March to 30 April.

The paper shows how a B MEY target can be used to: (i) determine relative employment and profitability measures; (ii) account for both the harvesting and processing sectors; and (iii) incorporate the interests of consumers and producers of fish. The profits-employment trade-off of adopting a B MEY target vs. a traditional B MSY target is calculated using a model and data from the Western and Central Pacific tuna fisheries (WCPTF), while a generic bioeconomic model is constructed to show numerical values of B MEY from including processing and/or retail sectors and the consumer benefits of harvesting fish. For the WCPTF, results show that the long-term gains per job lost from pursuing a B MEY target are worth several times the value of the average GDP per capita of Pacific Island Countries. The generic bioeconomic model shows that including a processing and/or retail sector, as well as measures of consumer benefit, lowers the B MEY target. However, there remains a broad range of parameter values for which B MEY is still greater than biomass at maximum sustainable yield, or B MSY.

The biological submodel represents the recruitment of new organisms into the fishery, the movement of organisms from one fishing area to another and from one depth to another, the growth of organisms and the mortality of organisms resulting both from natural causes and from fishing. The economic submodel represents the fishing effort exerted on each resource species, the monetary costs of fishing, the value of the harvest and the rent (or excess profits) to the fishery. Basic dynamics of the model results from changes in the number of organisms in the fishery over time, which can be summarized as a set of difference equations of the general form ?N/?t = R + I - E - M - F where ?N/?t is the net change in number of organisms in the fishery over time, R is recruitment, I is immigration, E is emigration, M is natural mortality and F is fishing mortality. R is a driving variable, whereas I, E, M and F are functions of the state of the system at any given point in time. The model can be run in a deterministic or stochastic mode. Values for parameters affecting rates of recruitment, movement, growth, natural mortality and fishing mortality can be selected from uniform, triangular or normal distributions. Use of the model within a fisheries-management framework is demonstrated by evaluating several management alternatives for the pink shrimp (Penaeus duorarum) fishery on the Tortugas grounds in the Gulf of Mexico. Steps involved in use of the model, including parameterization, validation, sensitivity analysis and stochastic simulations of management policies, are explained. © 1981.",English,Article,,Scopus,,"Tortugas grounds, Gulf of Mexico",North America,">100,000",decade,'NOT RELEVANT',week,Fisheries Dependent Data_Physiological Growth Indicators,2,2,3,"But the use of large-scale simulation models such as GBFSM in evaluating management alternatives is more controversial. On the one hand, skepticism concerning model predictions is justified based on the relative paucity of data on important biological and economic relationships in most marine fisheries. On the other hand, management decisions, explicit and/or implicit, are being made now for all marine fisheries and it is within this framework, where decisions are required in the face of uncertainty, that the usefulness of GBFSM and other fisheries management models must be evaluated (Waiters, 1977; Holling, 1978).",,Task 6.3 - social and economic effects on the impact of fisheries management,GBFSM,GBFSM,Single stock,pink shrimp,Size structured,single-fleet /metier,demersal,Yes,Spatially implicit,No,,Spatial management _Technical measures,No,Economic,total harvest_total revenue_total rent,Yes,FORTRAN,In this paper a bioeconomic simulation model of annual-crop marine fisheries (or fisheries were the target spp. is not expected to live longer than a year and previous biomass has no bearing on future biomass) is described and demonstrated on pink shrimp.

It was the only fishing activity since a new one with most features of an industrial fishery flourished following the introduction of the Manila clam in 1983. To compare the two fishing activities, a set of ecosystem indicators (landings, catches, discards, biomass of the system, mean Trophic Level of the system and exergy) obtained by a model approach, was applied. The model used was a mass-balance model of the lagoon ecosystem developed with the software package Ecopath with Ecosim. The 73 scenarios obtained by changing the fishing effort of the two different fisheries were used to explore the impact of fishing activity on the ecosystem. The results showed that the two activities are strongly interrelated, even if they do not exploit the same resources, and that the mechanical clam harvesting is the driving force able to affect the ecosystem state fundamentally. All this produces a strong conflict between the two kinds of fisheries. The ecosystem and social optimisation depend mainly upon a reduction of clam fishery, while the optimisation of the economic aspects is strictly linked to the maintenance of this fishing activity. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",English,Article,,Scopus,Not relevant to marine ecosystem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_0513,WU_Poos,J.

Our model, referred to as 'OSMOSE-WFS', explicitly considers both pelagic-demersal and benthic high trophic level (HTL) groups of fish and invertebrate species, and is forced by the biomass of low trophic level groups of species (plankton and benthos). We present a steady-state version of the OSMOSE-WFS model describing trophic interactions in the West Florida Shelf in the 2000s. OSMOSE-WFS was calibrated using a recently developed evolutionary algorithm that allowed simulated biomasses of HTL groups to match observed biomasses over the period 2005-2009. The validity of OSMOSE-WFS was then evaluated by comparing simulated diets to observed ones, and the simulated trophic levels to those in an Ecopath model of the West Florida Shelf (WFS Reef fish Ecopath). Finally, OSMOSE-WFS was used to explore the trophic structure of the West Florida Shelf in the 2000s and estimate size-specific natural mortality rates for a socio-economically important species, gag grouper (Mycteroperca microlepis). OSMOSE-WFS outputs were in full agreement with observations as to the body size and ecological niche of prey of the different HTL groups, and to a lesser extent in agreement with the observed species composition of the diet of HTL groups. OSMOSE-WFS and WFS Reef fish Ecopath concurred on the magnitude of the instantaneous natural mortality of the different life stages of gag grouper over the period 2005-2009, but not always on the main causes of natural mortality.

However, the stock always consists of local subpopulations or spawning subpopulations, among which there is some degree of exchange of individuals. Thus, the stock is commonly referred to as meta-population. We simulated two subpopulations of chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus) in the East China Sea and Yellow Sea based on the meta-population concept by setting up 12 scenarios. Using the data derived from the simulations and the surplus production model, we evaluated the effect of stock management based on 10 schemes, which involved different assumptions regarding the spatial structure of the stock and management strategies. The spatial structure of the stock was represented as 1) a meta-population, 2) two independent subpopulations or, 3) a unit stock. For management strategies, we focused on two methods of allocating the catch among the subpopulations: 1) assigning the catch in proportion to the biomass of each subpopulation or 2) assuming that the catch was uniform among the subpopulations by ignoring the spatial structure of the stock. Our results showed that (1) the maximum sustainable yield and the biomass at maximum sustainable yield could be achieved when there was little uncertainty in the CPUE and when the scheme was based on a meta-population assumption. However, the extinction probability of the stock increased with degradation of quality of the CPUE. (2) If we assumed there were two independent subpopulations by ignoring the exchange among the subpopulations, the stock was overfished and was not sustainable. (3) If the assessment and management was based on a unit stock assumption, the stock was either overfished or underexploited, depending on which CPUE was used as the abundance index of the stock, the methods of allocating catch along the subpopulations, and biological parameters such as the carrying capacity, intrinsic growth rate, and migration matrix. If the CPUE time series partially represented the trend of the biomass of the stock, for example by only representing the biomass of one of the subpopulations, there was a 100% probability of extinction under a certain situations. If the CPUE correctly reflected the dynamics of the biomass of the whole stock and the catch was assigned according to the biomass of each subpopulation, the effect of stock management was similar to (1), but it was suboptimal because the maximum sustainable yield could not be achieved. However, if the catch was allocated by ignoring the spatial structure of the stock, there was also a 100% probability of extinction under some situations. Therefore, to perform stock assessment and management for meta-populations, we recommend: (A) if enough information regarding subpopulations for stock assessment can be collected and there is little uncertainty in the observed data, the assessment and management of the stock should be based on a meta-population assumption. Otherwise, (B) a unit stock can be assumed but a more conservative management strategy should be adopted and a TAC (Total Allowed Catch) based on the spatial structure of the stock, i.e., the catch is allocated according to the abundance of the subpopulations, is needed to keep the fishery sustainable. (C) Before making a decision, the assessors or managers should conduct a management strategy evaluation to minimize management risk by evaluating the rules of management and taking into account the uncertainty in our understanding of the ecology of the species, collecting data, and assuming or estimating the parameters of the stock assessment model.",English,Article,,Scopus,Language,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_0528,Giannoulaki,S.

This contribution documents an attempt to build an ecosystem model of the Peruvian upwelling ecosystem and recreate the observed biomass trends through the period 1953-1984, using the Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) software. The time series of biomass, particularly of Peruvian anchovy and its various predators, are not reproduced by the EwE model based solely on the original parameters. Instead, to model the anchovy abundance fluctuations caused by El Nio and other oceanographic events, it is necessary to include mechanisms that were not part of the original description of the ecosystem, which focused on mass-balance. For example, a switch between large and small phytoplankton appears to be required to induce the observed abundance shifts between sardine and anchovy. Similarly, a 'mitigating' relationship must be assumed between bonito (Sarda chilensis) and seabirds for the 1965 collapse of seabirds to be reproduced by the model. Mechanisms of this sort, here proposed in a very tentative fashion, will have to be firmly established and quantified before a model can successfully explain both the older data series (1953-1984) as done here, and eventually the new series on the Peruvian upwelling system that became available only recently.

This study aims to develop an integrated dynamic assessment framework to evaluate coral reef conditions under different adaptation and climate change scenarios, and their consequential economic impacts in the small island community of Port Resolution on Tanna Island in Vanuatu. Our assessment framework follows a sequential multilayered modelling approach that uses System Dynamics (SD) coupled with Bayesian Network (BN) modelling to deal with the complexity and dynamicity of socioeconomic and environmental systems, and impacts from trans-discipline variables. The BN incorporated existing data and expert knowledge to project the future conditions of coral reefs under different scenario settings, and to parametrise and quantify the SD model where the existing data and information was insufficient. The SD was then used to simulate the dynamic relationship between coral reef condition and the economic benefits derived from its ecosystem services under different climate change (i.e. RCPs) and management scenarios through to 2070. Our findings show that sustainable community-based conservation management strategies are key to preserving the flow of coral reef ecosystem services under RCP 2.6 and 6.0.

This approach consisted in forcing a high trophic level model (OSMOSE) with an existing biogeochemical model (Eco3M-MED) representing the seasonal dynamics of the low trophic levels. The two models were linked through trophic interactions to represent the ecosystem dynamics from primary producers to top predators. In this study, we developed the multispecies, individual-based model OSMOSE in the Gulf of Gabes (OSMOSE-GoG). This model aims to capture the main processes that influence species life cycle and simulate the functioning of the ecosystem according to opportunistic predation process based on size selection and spatio-temporal co-occurrence between a predator and its prey. The spatial distribution of the eleven modelled species was derived from a Multi-Scale Species Distribution Modelling approach. We calibrated OSMOSE-GoG model with available data of biomass and fishing yield, using an optimization method based on evolutionary algorithms which is suitable for complex and stochastic models. Finally, OSMOSE-GoG was validated against independent data sets at different hierarchical levels: the individual (diet composition), population (mean size of commercial catch) and community levels (mean trophic level) following the Pattern-Oriented Modelling approach. The model outputs were overall consistent with the diet compositions and mean trophic levels derived from the ECOPATH model of the Gulf of Gabes (ECOPATH-GoG) and the observations of mean size of catches.

Finding appropriate indicators is challenging given the complexity of marine food webs as well as the ecosystem response to fishing pressure. In this study, an end-to-end model developed in the Gulf of Gabes ecosystem (Tunisia) was used to compare the performance of a set of ecosystem indicators in assessing the impact of fishing. This end-to-end model aimed to represent the ecosystem functioning by coupling two existing sub-models, the multispecies individual-based model OSMOSE, representing the dynamics of exploited species and the biogeochemical model Eco3M-Med. The aim of the indicator selection method is to evaluate the sensitivity of a set of ecological indicators regardless the fishing management plan. This method was performed in two major steps. The first step consisted in simulating three simple contrasted fishing strategies in the OSMOSE model exploiting target species (i.e. high trophic level, low trophic level or all species) and then applying a fishing effort multiplier for each fishing strategy to the focus target species. In the second step, three paradigms defining the desirable properties of an ecological indicator have been specified: i/the indicator decreases with increasing fishing pressure, ii/the indicator responds linearly to an increase in fishing pressure and iii/the indicator responds consistently across different fishing strategies. Our results highlighted that the majority of indicators have quite similar performance regarding the trend and the linearity of their responses. However, the size-based indicators seem to be the most robust to track ecosystem effects of fishing when the fishing strategy changes. A focus on size-based indicators showed that Large Fish Indicators (40 cm) derived from demersal or all surveyed species were the most suitable to reflect a change in the status of the Gulf of Gabes ecosystem due to fishing pressure. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,,Scopus,,"Gulf of Gabes, Tunisia",Africa,">100,000",five year,"5,000-10,000",two week,Fisheries Dependent Data_Physiological Growth Indicators_Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey,2,2,3,"Developing an end-to-end model was a first step to improve our understanding of the trophic functioning of the food web and simulate fishing impacts across trophic levels in the Gulf of Gabes ecosystem.

It is argued that without the EEZ such solutions would have been unlikely to emerge, and that a further extension of the EEZ is necessary to apply rights-based regulations to high seas fisheries. The current management regime of high seas fisheries lacks the necessary enforcement apparatus, which makes it necessary to apply trade sanctions, port measures and blacklisting to support regulations of high seas fisheries.

Most harvesting is carried out by distant water fishing nations, including the USA, Japan, Taiwan, China, and Korea. Problems of achieving sustainability and efficiency in the harvesting of the stocks by disparate countries are made more difficult due to changes in the harvesting levels of one fleet affecting the rents of another fleet through changes in the age distribution of stock. These types of problem are under review by the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission.

One important reason for this is that current approaches are based on individual-level endpoints, but the environmental protection goals are defined on the population level. Population models may be useful tools to link the individual to the population and thus increase value relevance and reduce uncertainty. However, this requires that simple models and guidance on how to use them are made available for risk assessors. In the present study, an approach for developing simple generic models for the ERA of fish populations is presented. Fish have high ecological and economic value and are frequently used in ERA. It is, therefore, highly desirable to develop better methods for ERA of fish populations. The models were based on five types of life histories, and they were set up to be useful in a number of different management scenarios based on different environmental protection goals. A decision framework was set up for three levels of models (continuous, time limited, and varying exposure) and three levels of environmental protection.

Enhancement targets were defined as a function of natural recruitment (Nr) and compared with current harvest strategies. The model was conditioned on a Western Australian fishery, then applied to greenlip stocks throughout Australia. Two levels of releases (50% Nr and 100% Nr) at varying fishing mortality (F), size at harvest, and size at release were evaluated in detail. Model validation was also undertaken by comparing the model-derived spawning biomass (SSb) with an alternative estimate (SSbf) obtained using in-water surveys and a different growth model. Economic profitability and increased spawning biomass were achieved for most stock enhancement scenarios, and optimal profitability occurred with a 10-20% decrease in F from current levels, a 10% decrease in minimum legal length, and an annual enhancement of Nr juveniles to match natural recruitment. More radical scenarios, such as an annual release of 150% Nr combined with a 30% decrease in size at harvest resulted in greater profitability (+175%) but presented a higher risk of wild stocks being replaced with hatchery genotypes. Sensitivity analysis revealed that mortality, size at release, and harvest price were the critical parameters, while costs of production and fishing were less important. At the national scale, an enhancement scenario involving an annual release of 6.1 million 4-cm juveniles (~age 2) resulted in a 60% increase in gross value of product ($25 to $40 million), a 120% increase in profitability ($12 to $26 million), and net present value ($190 to $420 million; 6% discount), and a 25% increase in SSb. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",English,Article,,Scopus,,Western Australian fishery,Australia,">100,000",five year,Not relevant,year,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey_Fisheries Dependent Data,Not relevant,3,3,"Stock enhancement in Haliotis laevigata fisheries was found

Enhancement targets were defined as a function of natural recruitment (Nr) and compared with current harvest strategies. The model was conditioned on a Western Australian fishery, then applied to greenlip stocks throughout Australia. Two levels of releases (50% Nr and 100% Nr) at varying fishing mortality (F), size at harvest, and size at release were evaluated in detail. Model validation was also undertaken by comparing the model-derived spawning biomass (SSb) with an alternative estimate (SSbf) obtained using in-water surveys and a different growth model. Economic profitability and increased spawning biomass were achieved for most stock enhancement scenarios, and optimal profitability occurred with a 10-20% decrease in F from current levels, a 10% decrease in minimum legal length, and an annual enhancement of Nr juveniles to match natural recruitment. More radical scenarios, such as an annual release of 150% Nr combined with a 30% decrease in size at harvest resulted in greater profitability (+175%) but presented a higher risk of wild stocks being replaced with hatchery genotypes. Sensitivity analysis revealed that mortality, size at release, and harvest price were the critical parameters, while costs of production and fishing were less important. At the national scale, an enhancement scenario involving an annual release of 6.1 million 4-cm juveniles (~age 2) resulted in a 60% increase in gross value of product ($25 to $40 million), a 120% increase in profitability ($12 to $26 million), and net present value ($190 to $420 million; 6% discount), and a 25% increase in SSb. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",English,Article,,Scopus,,Western Australian fishery,Australia,">100,000",five year,Not relevant,year,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey_Fisheries Dependent Data,Not relevant,3,3,"Stock enhancement in Haliotis laevigata fisheries was found

Uncertainty is, however, pervasive and its characterization is essential if we are to understand our effects on ecosystems. Traditional fisheries management has a poor track record for confronting uncertainty, but most management authorities are now committed to a precautionary approach. As a result, some of the most interesting methods for taking account of uncertainty in ecological systems have been developed by fisheries scientists. These methods evaluate the relative performance of different management procedures with the use of mathematical and statistical models that synthesize knowledge and speculation about the system of interest. Recent advances in computer-intensive statistics have made it possible to combine this approach with model fitting, so that the uncertainties and risks associated with different outcomes of management can be quantified.

However, climate effects on fisheries can be complex because they arise through physical, biological, and economic mechanisms that interact or may not be well understood. Although most researchers find it obvious to include physical and biological factors in predicting the effects of climate change on fisheries, the behaviour of fish harvesters also matters for these predictions. A general but succinct conceptual framework for investigating the effects of climate change on fisheries that incorporates the biological and economic factors that determine how fisheries operate is presented. The use of this framework will result in more complete, reliable, and relevant investigations of the effects of climate change on fisheries. The uncertainty surrounding long-term projections, however, is inherent in the complexity of the system. © 2012 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Retrospective data from the Bering Sea walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) catcher-processer fishery were used to model the impact of climate on spatial and temporal variation in catch and fishing locations and make inferences about harvester behavior in a warmer climate. Models based on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios predict a 40% decrease in sea ice by 2050, resulting in warmer Bering Sea temperatures. We find that differences in the value of catch result in disparate behavior between winter and summer seasons. In winter, warm temperatures and high abundances drive intensive effort early in the season to harvest earlier-maturing roe. In summer, warmer ocean temperatures were associated with lower catch rates and approximately 4% less fishing in the northern fishing grounds, contrary to expectations derived from climate-envelope-type models that suggest fisheries will follow fish poleward. Production-related spatial price differences affected the effort distribution by a similar magnitude. However, warm, low-abundance years have not been historically observed, increasing uncertainty about future fishing conditions. Overall, annual variation in ocean temperatures and economic factors has thus far been more significant than long-term climate change-related shifts in the fishery's distribution of effort.",English,Article,Gold,Scopus,,Berring Sea,Pacific,"10,000-50,000",decade,"10,000-50,000",multidecadal,Fisheries Dependent Data,3,3,3,,,Task 6.2 - climatic and ecological effects on the impact of fisheries management,Other,Other,Single stock,Walley Pollock,,multi-fleet/metier,Demersal,Yes,Not clear,Yes,not clear,Output control ,No,not specified,not specified,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_0577,Batts,M.

The ecology model is a network of coupled ordinary differential equations representing the rates of change in nitrogen mass of organic detritus, dissolved inorganic nutrient and coarse guilds of living biomass spanning microbes to megafauna. The equations include representations of feeding, metabolism, reproduction, active migrations, advection and mixing. Environmental driving data include temperature, irradiance, hydrodynamics and nutrient inputs from rivers, atmosphere and ocean boundaries.

Currently, the minimum mesh size (bar length) for pikeperch gillnet fishing in the Archipelago Sea is 43-45 mm. Enlarging the mesh size has been suggested to ensure the biological sustainability of pikeperch fishing. The impacts of enlarging the minimum allowable mesh size to 50 mm were analysed using a bio-economic simulation model and data based on pikeperch samples from professional catches from 1978 to 1997, and catch statistics. The effect of uncertainty in the variable values was examined by specifying probability distribution functions for the main variables and using Monte Carlo simulation.

One such trade-off is resource competition between fisheries and marine top predators. Managing this trade-off has so far been difficult due to a lack of knowledge regarding the amount and distribution of prey required by top predators. Here, we develop a framework that can be used to address this gap: a bio-energetic model linking top predator breeding biology and foraging ecology with forage fish ecology and fisheries management. We apply the framework to a Baltic Sea colony of common guillemots Uria aalge and razorbills Alca torda, two seabird species sensitive to local prey depletion, and show that densities of forage fish (sprat Sprattus sprattus and herring Clupea harengus) corresponding to the current fisheries management target B-MSY are sufficient for successful breeding. A previously proposed fisheries management target for conserving seabirds, 1/3 of historical maximum prey biomass (B-1/3), was also sufficient. However, the results highlight the importance of maintaining sufficient prey densities in the vicinity of the colony, suggesting that fine-scale spatial fisheries management is necessary to maintain high seabird breeding success. Despite foraging on the same prey, razorbills could breed successfully at lower prey densities than guillemots but needed higher densities for self-maintenance, emphasizing the importance of considering species-specific traits when determining sustainable forage fish densities for top predators. Synthesis and applications. Our bio-energetic modelling framework provides spatially explicit top predator conservation targets that can be readily integrated with current fisheries management.

The highly female-skewed sex ratio can be predicted as a consequence of increased fishing mortality that truncates the age distribution, and raises some concern about the overall fitness of the population. Management efforts may need to be directed toward maintenance of sex ratio as well as stock size, with evaluations of recruitment based on sex ratio or male stock size in addition to the traditional female-based stock-recruitment relationship. We used two stochastic, age-structured models to heuristically compare the effects of reducing fishing mortality on different life history stages and the relative impact of reductions in fertilization rates that may occur with highly skewed sex ratios. Our response variables included population size, sex ratio, lost egg fertility, and female spawning stock biomass. Population growth rates were highest for scenarios that reduced mortality for female gag (nearshore closure), while improved sex ratios were obtained most quickly with spawning reserves. The effect of reduced fertility through sex ratio bias was generally low but depended on the management scenario employed. Our results demonstrate the utility of evaluation of fishery management scenarios through model analysis and simulation, the synergistic interaction of life history and response to changes in mortality rates, and the importance of defining management goals. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.",English,Article,,Scopus,,West Atlantic,North America,">100,000",decade,">100,000",decade,Other (literature),2,2,2,,,Task 6.5 - management strategies,Other (Age and stage based population model),Other (Age and stage based population model),Single stock,Mycteroperca microlepis,Age structured_stage based,Fleet not considered,,No,Spatially implicit,No,,Technical measures_Input control ,Not clear,Biological,population size_sex ratio_lost egg fertility_female spawning stock biomass,no,,"Because males represent such a small

One way in which fish stocks-and their habitats-can be protected is through the establishment of marine reserves, areas that are closed to fishing. Although the potential economic benefits of such reserves have been shown for single-owner fisheries, their implementation quickly becomes complicated when more than one noncooperating harvester is involved in fishery management, which is the case on the high seas. How domultiple self-interested actors distribute their fishing effort to maximize their individual economic gains in the presence of others? Here, we use a game theoretic model to compare the effort distributions of multiple noncooperating harvesters with the effort distributions in the benchmark sole owner and open access cases. In addition to comparing aggregate rent, stock size, and fishing effort, we focus on the occurrence, size, and location of marine reserves. We show that marine reserves are a component of many noncooperative Cournot-Nash equilibria. Furthermore, as the number of harvesters increases, (i) both total unfished area and the size of binding reserves (those that actually constrain behavior) may increase, although the latter eventually asymptotically decreases; (ii) total rents and stock size both decline; and (iii) aggregate effort used (i.e., employment) can either increase or decrease, perhaps nonmonotonically.",English,Article,Green Published,WOS,,Hypothetical,Not relevant,'NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT',Simulated dynamics,'NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT',2,"""Our results are distinct from such analyses in that reserves emerge even in the complete absence of property rightsÉ.it nevertheless suggests that convincing a collection of states to agree to such a closure might be easier than otherwise expected.

These regulations have generated a sizable economics literature focused on the spatial behavior of fishermen. Fundamental to these studies is the consideration set (spatial alternatives) assumed by the researcher to be possessed by the decision agent. Often times this consideration set is assumed to be the entire spatial extent of the fishery. This research proposes the use of finite mixture modeling to endogenously estimate the formation of consideration sets and the method is applied to a unique spatial decision environment, the Atka mackerel fishery in the Aleutian Islands. Consideration sets are modeled using different macro-definitions of spatial regions to focus the micro-level spatial decision making within the fishery and to investigate the sensitivity of the results to alternative macro-level spatial definitions.

Yet, conditions are changing due to climate change. This research evaluates the potential economic consequences of increased seawater temperature on black pearl production. A stochastic-dynamic bioeconomic simulation simulated the growth of oysters and pearl quality under current and projected seawater temperatures in 2035 in the Northern Tuamotu Archipelago. Production strategies, including grafting intensity, grafting timeframe, and overall pearl quality distribution were included in the simulation to identify production strategies which maximized net present value (NPV) over ten-years. Across all simulated management scenarios, production occurring under projected seawater temperatures resulted in an average decline of 29.1% in expected NPV. Overall, the change in expected NPV stemmed from a decline in the quantity of pearls produced, decline in the quality of pearls produced, and an increase in time between production stages. The optimal production strategy for current and projected seawater temperatures across all management scenarios was to graft a whole cohort of oysters in December with the best possible pearl quality distribution. However, with production occurring with other pearl quality distributions, optimal grafting timeframe and intensity differs between temperature regimes. Aligning production strategies with seawater temperatures can ameliorate economic losses. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,,Scopus,,French Polynesia,Australia,5-10,'NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT',month,Physiological Growth Indicators,2,2,3,"The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the potential economic impact of the projected increase in seawater temperatures by 2035 (IPCC, 2019) on black pearl production through alterations in pearl quality, pearl quantity, and production time.

While large reductions in effort would almost certainly be required to maintain fishery profitability, the degree of effort reduction and the optimal seasonal distribution of effort and catch are sensitive to the time series of data used to estimate the production function.

We fit the model to data from 1979 through 2012, with and without trophic interactions and temperature effects, and use projections to derive single- and multi-species biological reference points (BRP and MBRP, respectively) for fisheries management. The multi-species model achieved a higher over-all goodness of fit to the data (i.e. lower negative log-likelihood) for pollock and Pacific cod. Variability from water temperature typically resulted in 5Ð15% changes in spawning, survey, and total biomasses, but did not strongly impact recruitment estimates or mortality. Despite this, inclusion of temperature in projections did have a strong effect on BRPs, including recommended yield, which were higher in single-species models for Pacific cod and arrowtooth flounder that included temperature compared to the same models without temperature effects. While the temperature-driven multi-species model resulted in higher yield MBPRs for arrowtooth flounder than the same model without temperature, we did not observe the same patterns in multi-species models for pollock and Pacific cod, where variability between harvest scenarios and predation greatly exceeded temperature-driven variability in yield MBRPs. Annual predation on juvenile pollock (primarily cannibalism) in the multi-species model was 2Ð5 times the annual harvest of adult fish in the system, thus predation represents a strong control on population dynamics that exceeds temperature-driven changes to growth and is attenuated through harvest-driven reductions in predator populations. Additionally, although we observed differences in spawning biomasses at the accepted biological catch (ABC) proxy between harvest scenarios and single- and multi-species models, discrepancies in spawning stock biomass estimates did not translate to large differences in yield.

Building on past simulations depicting known changes to the region, a suite of future scenarios was constructed to include a variety of climate change and harvest levels. Previously identified ecosystem shifts favoring pelagic species (zooplankton, planktivorous fish) over benthic species (benthos, benthic feeding fish), are further exaggerated under future climate scenarios. Environmental forcing was incorporated to mimic the declines in sea ice, and increases in temperature causing shifts in the food web from an ice algae-benthos-benthic fish pathway to a spring bloom-zooplankton-planktivorous fish dominated ecosystem. Future simulations indicate some stocks are unable to sustain current harvest levels until the end of the future simulations (2069), and may be extirpated (narwhal, eastern Hudson Bay beluga, polar bears, and walrus). Larger populations of marine mammals (ringed seals and western Hudson Bay beluga) are identified to increase in biomass even under extreme harvest and climate scenarios (a high future climate scenario coupled with a doubling in harvest rates).

We investigate the importance of a range of uncertainties with a focus on model structure and life histories when estimating bioeconomic target reference point (TRPs) and assess the policy implications of ignoring these uncertainties. We use three contrasting case studies to investigate the interactions between model, observational and process errors related to life-history parameters: the short-lived Japanese common squid Todarodes pacificus and Pacific saury Cololabis saira, and the slow-growing Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides. We developed a simulation framework to test the harvest strategies resulting from bioeconomic TRPs under various assumptions about model structures and parameters. We found the relative importance of different types of uncertainties affecting precision and accuracy of the model outputs varied according to the life-history traits. Little difference in TRP estimates was found between simple vs. complex population models for saury, while large differences were found for toothfish. The assumptions made about stock structure for squid not only resulted in different TRP estimates (generally, smaller for the multistock models), but also different economic outcomes depending on the balance of effort allocation between stocks. Synthesis and applications. We use models similar to those used in the actual management of three case study species to explore the effects of interacting uncertainties on the management advice. We show that the interactions between structural elements of the models lead to very different management advice, depending on the life history of the species concerned.

We investigate the importance of a range of uncertainties with a focus on model structure and life histories when estimating bioeconomic target reference point (TRPs) and assess the policy implications of ignoring these uncertainties. We use three contrasting case studies to investigate the interactions between model, observational and process errors related to life-history parameters: the short-lived Japanese common squid Todarodes pacificus and Pacific saury Cololabis saira, and the slow-growing Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides. We developed a simulation framework to test the harvest strategies resulting from bioeconomic TRPs under various assumptions about model structures and parameters. We found the relative importance of different types of uncertainties affecting precision and accuracy of the model outputs varied according to the life-history traits. Little difference in TRP estimates was found between simple vs. complex population models for saury, while large differences were found for toothfish. The assumptions made about stock structure for squid not only resulted in different TRP estimates (generally, smaller for the multistock models), but also different economic outcomes depending on the balance of effort allocation between stocks. Synthesis and applications. We use models similar to those used in the actual management of three case study species to explore the effects of interacting uncertainties on the management advice.

Ecosystem linkages may include trophic interactions and climate change effects on productivity for the relevant species within the system. Presently, models are evolving to include a comprehensive set of fishery and ecosystem information to address these broader management considerations. The increased scope of EBFM approaches is accompanied with a greater number of plausible models to describe the systems. This can lead to harvest recommendations and biological reference points that differ considerably among models. Model selection for projections (and specific catch recommendations) often occurs through a process that tends to adopt familiar, often simpler, models without considering those that incorporate more complex ecosystem information. Multi-model inference provides a framework that resolves this dilemma by providing a means of including information from alternative, often divergent models to inform biological reference points and possible catch consequences. We apply an example of this approach to data for three species of groundfish in the Bering Sea: walleye pollock, Pacific cod, and arrowtooth flounder using three models: 1) an age-structured ÒconventionalÓ single-species model, 2) an age-structured single-species model with temperature-specific weight at age, and 3) a temperature-specific multi-species stock assessment model. The latter two approaches also include consideration of alternative future climate scenarios, adding another dimension to evaluate model projection uncertainty. We show how Bayesian model-averaging methods can be used to incorporate such trophic and climate information to broaden single-species stock assessments by using an EBFM approach that may better characterize uncertainty. © 2015",English,Article,,Scopus,,Bering Sea,Pacific,'NOT RELEVANT',multidecadal,'NOT RELEVANT',year,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey_Fisheries Dependent Data,'NOT RELEVANT',2,'NOT RELEVANT',"Model selection for projections (and specific catch recommendations) often occurs through a process that tends to adopt familiar, often simpler models without considering those that incorporate more complex ecosystem information.

Ecosystem-based fisheries management requires an understanding of both the biological and social components, and management failure can occur when either are excluded. Despite the significance of both, most research has focused on characterizing biological uncertainty rather than on better understanding the impacts of human behavior because of the difficulty of incorporating human behavior into simulation models. In this study, we use the fisheries in Narragansett Bay (Rhode Island, USA) as a case study to demonstrate how coupled modeling can be used to represent interactions between the food web and fishers in a social-ecological system. Narragansett Bay holds both a commercial fishery for forage fish, i.e., Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus) and a recreational fishery for their predators, i.e. striped bass (Morone saxatilis) and bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix). To explore trade-offs between these two fisheries, we created a food web model and then coupled it to a recreational fishers' behavior model, creating a dynamic social-ecological representation of the ecosystem. Fish biomass was projected until 2030 in both the stand-alone food web model and the coupled social-ecological model, with results highlighting how the incorporation of fisher behavior in modeling can lead to changes in the ecosystem. We examined how model outputs varied in response to three attributes: (1) the forage fish commercial harvest scenario, (2) the predatory (piscivorous) fish abundance-catch relationship in the recreational fishery, and (3) the rate at which recreational fishers become discouraged (termed satisfaction loss). Higher commercial harvest of forage fish led to lower piscivorous fish biomass but had minimal effects on the number of piscivorous fish caught recreationally or recreational fisher satisfaction. Both the abundancecatch relationship and satisfaction loss rate had notable effects on the fish biomass, the number of fish caught recreationally, and recreational fisher satisfaction. Currently, the lack of spatial and location-specific fisher behavior data limits the predictive use of our model. However, our modeling framework shows that fisher behavior can be successfully incorporated into a coupled social-ecological model through the use of agent-based modeling, and our results highlight that its inclusion can influence ecosystem dynamics. Because fisher decision making and the ecosystem can influence one another, social responses to changing ecosystems should be explicitly integrated into ecosystem modeling to improve ecosystem-based fisheries management efforts.",English,Article,gold,WOS,,"Narragansett Bay (Rhode Island, USA)",North America,">100,000",multidecadal,">100,000",week,Fisheries independent and Dependent Data_data from published and unpublished reports and papers,2,2,2,"By linking a food web model with a fisher behavior model, we have demonstrated a social-ecological method that could be useful for testing social responses to environmental and anthropogenic perturbations.

We explore the possible effects that different exploitation rates may have on eastern Bering Sea groundfish using a multispecies simulation context that incorporates predator-prey relationships. At present, some groundfish species in the eastern Bering Sea are exploited up to the recommended levels of allowable biological catch, whereas others, for economic or bycatch limitation reasons, are only lightly exploited. We explore the possible long-term multispecies implications of different exploitation patterns on the biomass and yield of several groundfish species using predator-prey suitability estimates derived from multispecies virtual population analysis (MSVPA) in a multispecies simulation modeling context and compare those predictions with those from single-species forecasting models. Three different fishing scenarios that included eight species in the eastern Bering Sea were implemented in these models. In one scenario, the present exploitation rates were used for the model simulations; in the second scenario, all exploited species were more evenly exploited by fishing each species at its recommended allowable biological catch levels; and in the third scenario, there was no fishing for all the species. Results from the single-species and multispecies model simulations mostly showed the same direction of population trends. However, the magnitude of change was different for some species, which can be ascribed mainly to predation interactions. Greater differences were seen between the simulations that used the present exploitation rates and those in which no fishing occurred. The multispecies simulations that included predation interactions predicted much lower equilibrium population sizes for prey species populations under conditions of no fishing than did single-species simulations that did not take predator-prey relationships into account. These results show that multispecies models provide new insights into the implications of single-species harvesting strategies, particularly for prey species that are also the target of commercial fisheries.",English,Article,,WOS,,Bering Sea,Pacific,">100,000",multidecadal,">100,000",year,Fisheries Dependent Data,1,2,3,,,Task 6.2 - climatic and ecological effects on the impact of fisheries management,Other (MSVPA),MSVPA,Multi-stock (with species interactions),"walleye pollock_Pacific cod_Greenland turbot (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides)_yellowfin sole (Pleuronectes asper)_Rock

Unlike most of the literature on resource economics, but in line with ecological models, we allow the different biological processes of survival and recruitment to be affected differently by environmental uncertainties. We show that the overall effect of uncertainty on the optimal size of a fish stock is ambiguous, depending on the prudence of the value function. For the case of a risk-neutral fishery manager, the overall effect depends on the relative magnitude of two opposing effects, the 'convex-cost effect' and the 'gambling effect'. We apply the analysis to the Baltic cod and the North Sea herring fisheries, concluding that for risk neutral agents the net effect of environmental uncertainties on the optimal size of these fish stocks is negative, albeit small in absolute value. Under risk aversion, the effect on optimal stock size is positive for sufficiently high coefficients of constant relative risk aversion. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",English,Article,,Scopus,,"Baltic Sea, North Sea",Europe,">100,000",multidecadal,">100,000",year,Fisheries Dependent Data,3,3,3,"Our results suggest that even if fluctuations in environmental conditions would increase, for example due to climate change, there is little need to adapt fishery management recommendations.",,6.2_6.3,Other (bioeconomic model),Other (bioeconomic model),Single stock,Gadus morhua_Clupea harengus,Age structured,Fleet not considered,,Yes,No spatial context,Yes,recruitment,Output control ,No,Biological,stock size,not clear,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_0690,TI-SF,I.

We developed or improved applications of 3 ecosystem modeling approaches: Ecopath, Model of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystem assessment (MICE), and Atlantis. We also used Ecopath diets to predict impacts to predators using a statistical generalization of the dynamic Ecosim model (Predator Response to the Exploitation of Prey [PREP]). Models that included brown pelican Pelecanus occidentalis at the species level (MICE and Ecopath/PREP) both predict moderate to high vulnerability of brown pelicans to low sardine abundance. This vulnerability arises because sardine comprises a large fraction of their diet, and because other important prey (anchovy) also exhibit large population fluctuations. Two of the ecosystem models (MICE and Atlantis) suggest that California sea lions Zalophus californianus exhibit relatively minor responses to sardine depletion, due to having broader diets and lower reliance on another fluctuating species, anchovy. On the other hand, Ecopath/PREP suggests that sardine declines will have a stronger impact on California sea lions. This discrepancy may in part reflect structural differences in the models: Atlantis and MICE explicitly represent density dependence and age-structure, which can mitigate effects of prey depletion in these models. Future work should identify fisheries management strategies that are robust to uncertainties within and among models, rather than relying on single models to assess ecosystem impacts of management and forage fish abundance. © The authors 2019.

Here we couple possible catch scenarios under an IFQ scheme with ocean acidification impacts on shelled benthos and plankton, using an Atlantis ecosystem model for the US West Coast. IFQ harvest scenarios alone, in most cases, did not have strong impacts on the food web, beyond the direct effects on harvested species. However, when we added the impacts of ocean acidification, the abundance of commercially important groundfish such as English sole (Pleuronectes vetulus), arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias), and yellowtail rockfish (Sebastes flavidus) declined up to 20%-80%, owing to the loss of shelled prey items from their diet.

However, it may not be feasible to achieve MSY simultaneously for multiple species because of trade-offs that result from interactions between species, mixed fisheries and the multiple objectives of stakeholders. The premise in this study is that MSY is a concept that needs adaptation, not wholesale replacement. The approach chosen to identify tradeoffs and stakeholder preferences involved a process of consulting and discussing options with stakeholders as well as scenario modelling with bio-economic and multi-species models. It is difficult to intuitively anticipate the consequences of complex trade-offs and it is also complicated to address them from a political point of view. However, scenario modelling showed that the current approach of treating each stock separately and ignoring trade-offs may result in unacceptable ecosystem, economic or social effects in North Sea fisheries. Setting F-MSY as a management target without any flexibility for compromises may lead to disappointment for some of the stakeholders. To treat FMSY no longer as a point estimate but rather as a Pretty Good Yield within sustainable ranges was seen as a promising way forward to avoid unacceptable outcomes when trying to fish all stocks simultaneously at FMSY.

One way to manage these threats is through Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), which safeguard valuable ecosystems within their confines. Despite the ecological and socio-economic benefits they provide (Whittingham et al. 2003), the management of MPAs is often severely constrained by both a lack of funding and a poor relationship with communities living around (or within) them. Although many efforts aimed at coral reef management and conservation within MPAs in Vietnam have been initiated and implemented, policymakers repeatedly face questions such as how do local residents feel they have been affected by the establishment of the MPA? Will active management of an MPA provide greater net economic benefits in the long term? How can these benefits be ÔcapturedÕ, both to fund MPA management and provide socio-economic stability for local communities?. Using the HonMun MPA as an example, this study explores the relationships between (1) the economic value of coral reefs, (2) coastal livelihoods, (3) coral reef degradation and (4) possible policy interventions in Vietnam. We estimated the economic value of coral reefs in the Hon Mun MPA through a focus on reef fisheries and reef-related tourism, as well as non-use values provided by reef ecosystems. Livelihood aspects of reef use were investigated by engaging with different reef stakeholders. We found out how villagers perceived changes in both quality of life and resources, and uncovered their views on resource impacts on human activities. To derive a decision-making framework for the MPA management options, we analysed the costs and benefits of a Ôwith MPA managementÕ scenario and a Ôwithout MPA managementÕ scenario. We also established linkages between economic values of coral reefs, financial sustainability and local socioeconomic issues. © Cambridge University Press 2013.",English,,,Scopus,,"Hon Mun Marine Protected Area, Vietnam",Asia,'NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT',Other (interviews),'NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT',,,Task 6.3 - social and economic effects on the impact of fisheries management,not specified,not specified,"Other (no biological component, only socioeconomic implications are assessed)",,,,,Yes,No spatial context,No,,Spatial management ,No,Economic,consumer surplus (recreational benefits)_producer surplus (recreational benefits)_value-added fishery value (fisheries benefits)_willingness to pay (conservation benefits)_total economic value (overall benefits),no,,"Results show that tourism benefits of coral reefs are the key source of revenue for park management and local livelihood improvements. In the long term, continued MPA management would provide greater net benefits than a Ôwithout MPA managementÕ scenario. To ensure future management, Hon Mun needs to develop an autonomous financing regime, e.g. through a user-fee for ecotourists. Subsequent revenues could be ploughed back into MPA management and support alternative livelihood schemes in the region.

Given the breadth of environmental benefits oysters provide, as well as their commercial and cultural importance, sustainable oyster production has become a priority in several regions, including the Chesapeake Bay. Current strategies include treating restored reefs as permanent sanctuaries, which provide long-term environmental benefits yet removes them from the fishery, or harvesting reefs on a rotational basis, which provides economic value yet decreases environmental benefits. The long term dynamics of these strategies is unknown. Oysters have a complex, biphasic life cycle (i.e., sessile adult and motile larval stages) and their viability is intimately tied to a suite of environmental factors including, but not limited to, flow regime, total suspended solids, temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen. In order to determine how different oyster management strategies affect oyster dynamics, we developed a multi-model approach that integrates a 2-D hydrodynamic model, a larval transport model, and a spatially-explicit, agent-based population dynamics model to simulate long term oyster dynamics. We applied our model to a ten reef system in the Great Wicomico River in the Chesapeake Bay, and simulated six different combinations of sanctuary and/or harvest management scenarios over an 8-year period. We evaluated the environmental and commercial benefits of each strategy. Our results indicated that sanctuary reefs are beneficial, and that the spatial position of sanctuary reefs strongly affected source-sink dynamics and must be considered before implementing a harvest regime. Simulations that did not consider the source/sink dynamics of the reefs yielded larger numbers of oysters for harvest in the short-term, yet resulted in a complete fishery collapse in the long term. Selective, rotational harvest, resulted in lower annual yield, but the fishery persisted throughout the eight year simulation. This integrated modeling approach helped reduce uncertainty within the study system and can help natural resource managers understand ecosystem-level processes leading to more informed decision making across spatial and temporal scales.

We develop a bioeconomic model for the Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) out of Nain, northern Labrador, incorporating climate variability into growth. We derive parameters necessary for the bioeconomic analysis through optimization and identify optimal equilibrium conditions for the model with and without climate variability. Accounting for variability results in a slightly higher optimal harvest, fishing effort and stock. We find an optimal effort of 591 fishing weeks and harvest of 156 920 kg for 2014, suggesting that both were below optimal. We further find that increased temperature leads to higher optimal effort and net benefits at steady state. Despite numerous uncertainties, data and knowledge gaps limiting the accuracy of our estimates, this is the first effort to identify the equilibrium harvesting conditions for this currently uneconomic, yet socially and culturally important fishery. The methodology can be applicable to other data-deficient fisheries with similar challenges and unknowns, to advance the understanding of socially optimal harvesting and interactions with environmental variability. © Canadian Science Publishing.

First, optimization is often assumed for harvester behavior despite system complexity and the often neglected costs associated with information gathering and deliberation. Second, ecosystem interactions are infrequently modeled despite a growing awareness that these interactions are important. This paper develops a simulation model to examine the consequences of harvesting at two trophic levels in a coral-reef food web. The model assumes adaptive rather than optimizing behavior among fishermen. The consequences of changing economic, biological, and social parameters are examined using resilience as an evaluative framework. Three general conclusions are reached. First, the simulated ecosystem is sensitive to small changes in economic, biological, and social parameters. Second, threshold effects are common. Third, as compared to results typical of traditional single-species optimization models, some results are counter-intuitive. Benefits of this approach are that the model affirms and adds to the results of traditional bio-economic harvest models, is empirically operational, and provides a richer selection of policy alternatives.

In addition to defining relatively large population units that are more or less reproductively independent (i.e., stocks), the process of stock identification should also strive to recognize linkages among stocks and finer-scale internal structure within them. Considerable attention has been devoted to documenting spatial patterns and exploring their ecological implications, but less attention has been paid to the full suite of complementary fishery management tools available to account for spatial patterns. We consider different aspects of the quota-setting process through which spatial structure can be addressed, including use of spatially structured stock assessment models, management strategy evaluation, and incorporation of spatial indices into harvest control rules. One common problem is that fishery management remains essentially nonspatial, even if spatial dynamics are considered in models. Conversely, there are also instances in which management is spatially explicit but with little scientific basis, which can be an opportunity for research and adaptive management. Data demands and additional uncertainties impose limitations on the application of spatially structured models and might offset the gains achieved by more detailed model specification. Therefore, we also consider complementary or alternative approaches for spatially explicit management, including distribution of catch among management areas, marine protected areas, and nested scales of governance. We conclude that a more dynamic relationship is needed among empirical researchers, modelers, and fisheries managers to identify and respond to complex spatial structure in both fisheries science and management. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Here we use a generic, spatially explicit, individual-based model to analyze fundamental interrelations and feedback loops relevant for coral reef dynamics, including recruitment, herbivory, benthic interactions, and fisheries. We assess the influence of three different fishing regimes (i.e. no-take, non-destructive and destructive fishing) and larval connectivity on the resilience of a coral reef community and explore respective thresholds. Simulation results show that changes in one of these parameters and a resulting imbalance in one feedback loop can disorder the whole interplay of regulating processes. Under many analyzed conditions alterations of herbivory or recruitment may induce a self-enhancing degradation of a coral dominated ecosystem state. Model results show that reefs can persist under non-destructive fishing with adequate larval connectivity but isolated reef sites are threatened at current modes of perturbations, because low larval recruitment does not allow for sufficient post-disturbance recovery. At high connectivity levels, fast growing species dominate and may displace other species. Often, these species increase three-dimensional structure, and thus, refuges for herbivores. However, this also reduces functional redundancy and if the dominant species (here Acropora muricata) is highly susceptible to thermally induced bleaching an extreme temperature event may cause overall coral extirpation and a regime shift to algal dominance. The model constitutes a virtual laboratory for reef studies, gives insights on how particular effectors may trigger cascades in the coral community, and hence highlights the necessity to analyze mechanisms not only separately, but within the whole system's context to fully grasp complex responses in ecosystems. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,,Scopus,,Not relevant,Not relevant,'NOT RELEVANT',multidecadal,'NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT',Simulated dynamics,'NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT',,,Task 6.2 - climatic and ecological effects on the impact of fisheries management,Not specified,Not specified,Other (no fish stock considered),no fish species (herbivorous fish are represented by means of their grazing rate),"Other (no fish stock modelled, so no population structure)",Fleet not considered,,No,Spatially explicit,Yes,mortality,No management measures,No,Biological,percent coral cover,no,,"The authors use a spatially explicit model to analyze the consequences of  three different fishing regimes (i.e. no-take, non-destructive and destructive fishing) on the structure of a virtual coral reef.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_0742,Batts,T.

The socially optimal policy for maximizing discounted net benefits from the fishery within an uncertain environment is determined using a dynamic programming approach and numerical solution method.

We propose a generic infinite horizon discrete time fisheries management model by modifying existing models and frameworks of analysis to reflect seasonal variation or more general multi-periodicity in parameters, variables, or functional forms. Our model captures such variations via repeated cycles of multiple intervals with differing characteristics. The framework offers a simple and intuitive set up of arbitrary periodicity and seasonality in any feature, which significantly increases model realism. Further, it distances itself from continuous time modeling approaches where uniqueness and solvability of periodic models generally are difficult to assert. In our setting, the governing equations for the time-dependent value function of the management optimization problem are shown to be equivalent to a high-dimensional contraction and hence ensure uniqueness and a feasible solution algorithm. We illustrate our approach using a simple example to demonstrate that accounting for seasonality in fisheries management can improve outcomes considerably. Our framework also provides for analysis of seasonal regulatory measures. Ultimately, our approach applies to renewable resource management more generally and to many infinite-horizon, discrete time optimization problems with periodic features. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The discretization method consists of three steps: first, we estimate a proper growth function for the continuous-time model with the Ensemble Kalman Filter. Second, we use the Runge-Kutta method to discretize the growth function. Third, we use the Bellman approach to analyze the optimal management of seasonal fisheries in a discrete-time setting. We analyze both the case of quarterly harvest and the case of monthly harvest, and we compare these cases with the case of annual harvest. We find that seasonal harvesting is a winÐwin optimal solution that provides higher harvest, higher optimal steady state equilibrium, and higher economic value than annual harvesting. We also demonstrate that the discretization method overcomes the errors and preserves the strengths of both continuous and discrete-time bioeconomic models. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,,Scopus,Not relevant to fisheries management evaluation models,The article is about an assessment model not a simulation model to evaluate management strategies,Australia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_0757,WU_Poos,"Lagarde, A; Doyen, L; Ahad-Cisse, A; Caill-Milly, N; Gourguet, S; Le Pape, O; Macher, C; Morandeau, G; Thebaud, O",How Does MMEY Mitigate the Bioeconomic Effects of Climate Change for Mixed Fisheries,2018,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,154,,317,332,10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.07.001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.07.001,"This paper examines the impact of climate change on the bio-economic performance of Bay of Biscay mixed fisheries and explores the capacity of alternative management strategies to cope with these impacts.

Consequently, decision makers and public typically ask for simple and understandable information with confidence regarding the availability of the services and the probable economic value. Here, we compiled published information on density enhancement and species life-history information to quantify fish and crustacean production and its uncertainty associated with the current extent of oyster (Crassostrea virginica) reefs in Mobile Bay, Alabama. We applied Alabama fishing size limits as a cutoff to exclude the production of non-harvestable size individuals. Fishery landing (2005Ð2015) and Willingness-To-Pay information were used to quantify the economic benefit of the harvestable production enhancement (commercial and recreational production). Sixteen species were found to be production-enhanced in the bay with a mean of 354 ± 182 g m?2 year?1, of which 170 ± 112 g m?2 year?1 was economically quantifiable based on their harvestable production and landing information. The mean economic value was $509,000 year?1 in direct economic value for commercial fishers and $19.59 million year?1 estimated by the willingnesstopay value from recreational anglers. The results demonstrated a substantial positive economic benefit of ecosystem services from oyster reefs associated with fishery production in Mobile Bay, Alabama.

The form and function of management remains a major strategic issue as we approach the next century. Management approaches for the future need to focus on integrating biological, economic, social and political considerations of fisheries systems through new participatory management structures and processes. This requires institutionalizing a new organizational framework operating under an appropriate process for interdisciplinary decision making. There is a need to overcome disciplinary organizational structures which characterize most established management systems throughout the world, to include relevant participants in effective co-management regimes, and to employ suitable methods of problem solving borrowed from the field of management science. The term 'Fisheries Management Science' has been coined to describe the application of the scientific method of problem solving in this more comprehensive fishery management context. It provides an ideal framework for participatory decision making. Implementation requires defining the roles and responsibilities of the participants, the context and methodologies for setting multiple objectives and constraints, the modelling and analysis of alternative management scenarios, and the assessment and management of risk.

Here, the DataReli"" toolbox is proposed to evaluate the quality of the data used during the construction of ecosystem models, their coherence across trophic levels, and whether data limitations prevent the model long-term applications. This toolbox is the combination of three operational and complementary analyses: (i) the pedigree index to determine to what extent a model was calibrated on data of local origin; (ii) the graphical analysis known as PREBAL to assess whether a model respects some basic ecological and fisheries principles; and (iii) a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness of model predictions to small variations in input data. The toolbox is delivered to potential users with main generic recommendations on how interpreting results conjointly and on which decisions to make about parameters' revisions or model uses' restrictions. (i) Corrections of parameters should be preferentially envisaged when modelling data-rich environments. (ii) For those models with an overall pedigree index above 0.4, a closer look at the pedigree routine, i.e. values by parameters and compartments, and the PREBAL analysis would help to prioritize parameters needing improvement. (ii)' For Ecopath models of no overall acceptable quality (overall pedigree index <0.4), we recommend stopping the DataReli procedure at this point. (iii) In terms of sensitivity analysis, marked responses of model predictions to small variations in the input values must preferentially lead to restrictions in the model applications compared to corrections of parameter estimates. A concrete application of the ""DataReli"" toolbox to the pre-existing Ecopath model of the Bay of Biscay continental shelf food web is presented.

Fisheries management is gradually moving away from single-species assessments to more holistic, multi-species approaches that better respond to the reality of ecosystem processes. Quantitative modelling methods such as Ecopath with Ecosim can be useful tools for planning, implementing and evaluating ecosystem-based fisheries management strategies. The aim of this study was therefore to model the energy fluxes within the food web of this highly pressured ecosystem and to extract practical information required in the diagnosis of ecosystem state/health. A well-described model comprising 30 living and two non-living compartments was successfully constructed with data of local origin, for the Bay of Biscay continental shelf. The same level of aggregation was applied to primary producers, mid-trophic-levels and top-predators boxes. The model was even more general as it encompassed the entire continuum of marine habitats, from benthic to pelagic domains. Output values for most ecosystem attributes indicated a relatively mature and stable ecosystem, with a large proportion of its energy flow originating from detritus. Ecological network analysis also provided evidence that bottom-up processes play a significant role in the population dynamics of upper-trophic-levels and in the global structuring of this marine ecosystem. Finally, a novel metric based on ecosystem production depicted an ecosystem not far from being overexploited.

The Tracking and Analysis Framework (TAF) model was originally designed to evaluate the biotic, economic, and health effects of acid deposition. The TAF model developed in our study was used to assess the biotic effects of different levels of sulfate deposition resulting from alternative emissions scenarios. The aquatic portion of the model is based on a lumped-parameter watershed chemistry model, MAGIC (Model of Acidification of Groundwater in Catchments). The original TAF model was built by calibrating MAGIC to 33 lakes in the Adirondack Mountains. We calibrated MAGIC to 78 HELM lakes, and built reduced-form models from these MAGIC predictions. We evaluated TAF predictions of acid neutralizing capacity (ANC), a fish acid stress index (ASI), and the probability of fish presence in 2030 for four different SO 2 emissions-reduction scenarios. The most dramatic emissions reduction scenario produced only modest increases in mean ANC (16.8 ?eq/L ± 7.9 ?eq/L) and slight increases in mean predicted probability of presence of acid-sensitive fish (0.07± 0.09) across all lakes. However, a small number of lakes were predicted to have more substantial increases in ANC and improvements in other conditions for acid-sensitive fish. Our results reflect the reality that many of the high elevation lakes of Maine historically had low ANC and that some were even acidic in pre-industrial times. Thus, 'recovery' for most of the high elevation lakes of Maine will be modest under any scenario of reduced acidic deposition. © Springer 2005.",English,Article,,Scopus,Not relevant to marine ecosystem,"Maine, USA",Europe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_0784,Mildenberger,D.

These policies may not be effective, however, if implemented simultaneously. Domestic management of the swordfish fishery was found to be effective, despite the small share of the international quota. Lastly, producer surpluses earned by the domestic PLL vessel owners are significantly affected by: (1) changes in swordfish demand (due to, for example, the recent chef 's boycott), (2) success at negotiating the swordfish quota share, (3) catch rates, and (4) relative costs of heterogeneous vessels and trip behavior. © 2000 Marine Resources Foundation.",English,Article,,Scopus,,North Atlantic,Europe,">100,000",five year,NOT RELEVANT',snapshot/no repeat sampling,Simulated dynamics,2,2,3,"Results indicated that if a cost-effective means can be implemnted for reducing the catch of undersized fish or increasing the survival rate of discards in the US, the entire North Atlandtic industry would benefit from the resulting stock effect.",,Task 6.3 - social and economic effects on the impact of fisheries management,"Other (bioeconomic model, no name)",Other (bioeconomic model),Multi-stock (without species interactions),Swordfish_tuna_coastal sharks_pelagic sharks_other fish,Age structured,individual vessel based,short vessels_medium vessels_long vessles,Yes,No spatial context,No,,Output control ,International,Social,number of vessels in the fleet,no,,"Results indicated that if a cost-effective means can be implemnted for reducing the catch of undersized fish or increasing the survival rate of discards in the US, the entire North Atlandtic industry would benefit from the resulting stock effect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_0786,Casagrandi,"Lehuta, S; Holland, DS; Pershing, AJ",Investigating interconnected fisheries: a coupled model of the lobster and herring fisheries in New England,2014,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,71,2,272,289,10.1139/cjfas-2013-0185,http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2013-0185,"Ostensibly separate fisheries are often linked through ecological, environmental, and human mediated processes that can impact their productivity, profitability, and resilience; however, managers rarely explicitly account for these linkages.

Removals are simulated as total mortality modulated using a selectivity pattern and a fishing activity coefficient. ALADYM uses the classical equations of population dynamics to create a tool that uses fishery-independent information (e.g. from trawl surveys) as the primary source. The formulation of population dynamics at a small time scale (month) allows to model the effects of harvest controls that evolve through the year, which is particularly useful for fast growing species. The possibility of specifying a vector of natural mortality by age/length makes the model more suitable for situations where stocks are exploited at an early life stage, as in many Mediterranean fisheries, while introducing variations along the time of the harvesting pattern accounts for non-equilibrium situations. Stochastic effects can be added to some key life-history traits to incorporate uncertainty in input parameters and in their relationships.

A Bayesian belief network is used to synthesize the findings from these separate studies and to evaluate the robustness of management decisions to different priorities and various sources of uncertainty.

ITQs allocate to users of a resource a share of a total allowable catch (TAC) which they are free to use, lease, or sell. We outline an approach to modelling the effect of an ITQ system in a multi-species, multi-sector fishery and apply it to the Coral Reef Fin Fish Fishery (CRFFF) in Queensland, Australia. An ITQ model, based on the assumption that operators seek to maximize profits, simulates the use of tradeable quota units by operators in the fishery, taking account of the initial quota allocation to operators, seasonal fish prices and individual operator variable costs, their fishing efficiency and experience, and constraints on vessel movements. Rationalization of the fishery is predicted to occur under an ITQ system for the CRFFF, which will lead to reductions in effort, increases in profits, and changes over time in quota prices. The ecological consequences of transferable quota in the multi-species fishery are seen in the catch and discard levels of the less profitable species, even though a TAC was set. This had flow-on effects on biomass. For example, simulations showed that the TAC for the primary target species, coral trout, was used more fully than that for a less valuable target species, red throat emperor, and that this was achieved through increased discarding of red throat emperor. Catches of both coral trout and red throat emperor that were derived from the model were higher than those recently observed in the fishery. The effort predicted by the model, however, closely approximated the actual effort observed in the fishery following implementation of ITQ management.

Using a Monte Carlo sampling of feasible parameters space, we show that effort regulation has good chances (87% of the cases) of maintaining the end stock ratio near equal levels (1/2 < stock ratio <2) when the initial stock ratio is equal. If the initial stock ratio is not equal, however, there is a high risk (about 50% of the cases) that effort control increases differences in the relative species abundances, rather than diminishing them. The effects depend on whether the key factors determining fishing profitability are counteracting or reinforcing each other, and their relative strength.

A fourth actor, the manager, imposes or modifies the rules, or. in terms of the model, modifies some particular parameters. Thus, the model allows us to simulate and evaluate the mid-term biologic and economic effects of particular management measures. The bio-economic nature of the model is given by the interaction among the three boxes, by the market simulation and, particularly, by the fishermen behaviour.

We first show that optimal selectivity depends negatively on the level of effort cost, but that this relationship is not continuous. Optimal selectivity switches when real effort cost goes beyond a certain level, and this switch induces a non-marginal reduction in the level of fishing effort. In the second part of this article, we show that the current level of real effort cost in the Nephrops fishery of the Bay of Biscay is far below the switch point, which makes high selectivity optimal. The discrepancy between optimal and current selectivity may be explained by the state of the fishery management and also by the fact that selectivity is hardly observable with the type of gear presently used.

Although the ecosystem based management (EBM) focuses on ecosystem equilibria, to provide realistic management measures for important activities at sea such as fisheries and aquaculture, there is a need of quantities; mechanistic approaches are suggested as reliable solutions. Here, a Dynamic Energetic Budget (DEB) application studies the link between environmental change (temperature forecasted increasing scenario in a context of COP 21 [Paris climate conference Agreement] and food density increase) and life-history traits of some Mediterranean fishery and aquaculture target species (Engraulis encrasicolus, Dicentrarchus labrax, Mytilus galloprovincialis, Crassostrea gigas). A sensitivity analysis was applied to simulate the effects of future environmental change on the time needed to reach the commercial size and the length at first maturity. We also explored the efficiency of Integrated Multitrophic Aquaculture (IMTA) as a potential management solution in a context of an adaptive EBM. The worst scenario of rising temperatures (+2 ¡C) seems to reduce the time needed to reach the commercial size in most species and IMTA potentiates the thermal effect on it. A spatial contextualisation of model outcomes allowed disentangling potential conflicts among human activities at sea. The DEB based life history traits approach can provides quantities to inform the management of marine activities at local scale additionally allowing translating complex results into useful figurative representations for stakeholders. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,,Scopus,Not relevant to fisheries management evaluation models,,,,,,,,3,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_0858,Batts,S.

Fisheries for demersal and pelagic species are important, and shared by nationals from both countries. In this study, a trophic model is constructed, and several whole system statistics and network flow indices determined for this ecosystem. Possible impacts of trawling on the biomass of model components, through simulation of the effects of varying fishing mortality rate, were also explored. The model components consist of 15 fish groups, 5 invertebrate groups, seabirds, phytoplankton, detritus and discards. Results indicate that the food web is dominated by the detrital pathway, and that the export of detritus out of the system is significant. Mixed trophic impacts show that detritus and lower trophic levels have a significant positive impact on other groups, i.e. they exert bottom-up control of the food web. Mean transfer efficiency is 12.2%, Finn cycling index 7.2%, path length 6.2, omnivory index 0.2, and system ascendency and overhead 42 and 58%, respectively. Results suggest that, although the Gulf appears to be relatively mature, it may experience some degree of instability due to exploitation and the large seasonal variation in salinity, among other factors. Simulations of different fishing mortality rates show a strong impact on the biomass of system components. Increasing fishing mortality by 50% for 5 years resulted in a marked decrease in biomass of fish groups accompanied by an increase in that of invertebrates, notably penaeids and crabs. Fish biomass recovers after fishing pressure is relaxed, while that of crabs declined further. On the other hand, a reduced fishing mortality rate elicited the opposite response in system components, except for crab of which the biomass again declined significantly when that of fish increased. Biomass of groups at higher trophic levels obtained during trawl surveys conducted in 1945, before trawl fishing was introduced in the Gulf, were significantly higher than current biomass, except for carangids, penaeids, and possibly clupeoids. This may indicate a possible shift towards a system dominated by lower trophic levels. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

We investigate some aspects of the hoki mixed fisheries, consisting of four fleets and nineteen metiers, by considering the technical interactions between hoki and Southern hake (Merluccius australis). The dynamics of effort allocation were modelled using gravity model, using value per unit of effort (VPUE) as attractivity coefficient. Several management scenarios, based on different levels of TACC, effort limits and deemed value have been defined. The impact of these strategies on spawning biomass and catches has been investigated. The results confirm that the deemed value may, in combination with TACC, be an efficient management tool. By increasing the hoki deemed value, we could somehow limit the decrease in the hoki TACC needed to harvest Western hoki sustainably. Constraining hoki fishing also restricts Southern hake fishing in the Chatham Rise and in the West Coast South Island, but leads to increased targeting of this species in the Sub-Antarctic area.

The simulations account for a variety of fleet behaviours (ranging from fixed by tradition to dynamic economics-driven). The modelling framework is applied to the Channel flatfish mixed fisheries. Transferable quota allocation regimes would particularly benefit small netters and beam trawlers, which would achieve a profit of (sic)50-150 million without compromising the conservation of eastern Channel sole, but it could impair the sustainability of other stocks. If quota is owned by fishers, the least fishing-efficient fleet stops fishing, but makes substantial profit from leasing quotas to beam trawlers and to small and large netters, which remain actively fishing.

Ecological and economic indicators substantially improved when the status quo management system based on sustained annual harvesting of the resource at a rate of 8% of the total exploitable biomass was replaced with a rotational harvesting scheme whereby fishing was conducted at a higher exploitation rate (30%), following a four-year closure period. Closures allowed queen conch biomass to recover and accumulate undisturbed, leading to an 11% increase in the average standing density of adult conchs and a 26% increase in the net present value of the fishery, as compared with the status quo scenario. Multiple sources of improvement associated with rotation of fishing areas were identified, such as the harvesting of larger quantities of conch meats and pearls as well as reduced fishing costs. In addition to an informed assessment of the economic potential of the fishery under rotational management, the model provides a useful benchmark to estimate the gains associated with further reductions in illegal, unre-ported, and unregulated fishing, which has brought the fishery to the brink of collapse in recent years. © 2021 MRE Foundation, Inc.

It is clear that in some cases marine protected areas may be crucial to sustaining resources. Most research to date has considered the biological or ecological effects of such reserves. However, little real analysis has been published that takes into account the links between the biology and the economics of the fisheries involved, making the economic benefits to fisheries less clear.

The main source of conflict occurs between the need for stock conservation and the need for fishing community well-being, which is typically measured by employment and income levels. For most fisheries, overexploitation of the stock requires a reduction in the level of fishing activity. While this may lead to long-term benefits (both conservation and economic), it also leads to a short-term reduction in employment and regional incomes. In regions which are heavily dependent on fisheries, short-term consequences of conservation efforts may be considerable. The relatively high degree of scientific uncertainty with respect to the status of the stocks and the relatively short lengths of political terms of office, generally give rise to the short-run view taking the highest priority when defining policy objectives.

In particular, there are three major drivers: (a) the search for human well-being, health and safety, (b) the maintenance of ecological sustainability and environmental equilibrium, and (c) the tolerance of an increasing human population pressure and demand for wealth creation. We propose here the use of a conceptual guidance tool - the ecological sustainability trigon (EST) - as a means of building and testing environmental management scenarios. Although it requires further testing, the EST allows us to (a) address those three major drivers using human society view as a common currency, and (b) describe our behaviour, energetics (economy) and dynamics through ecological theory.

To represent the spatially and temporally constrained, interspecific interactions among reef fishes we employ Atlantis (a spatially explicit, biogeochemical ecosystem model) as our simulation tool. Within Atlantis, we evaluate the performance of a two-point harvest control rule (HCR) that adaptively increases fishing mortality linearly between upper and lower biomass thresholds based on the available biomass of the stocks. This example demonstrated the use of a blanket two-point HCR that assessed the available biomass of several reef fish species (often co-caught in fishing gear) both simultaneously and objectively. To estimate the impact of reef fish fishing on species abundance and biodiversity in the ecosystem, we examined four low and four high fishing mortality (F) scaler scenarios. All model projections are forward looking, representing a 50-year time horizon (2010 to 2060). We evaluated the performance of the two-point HCRs under the eight fishing mortality scenarios using ecosystem metrics that were previously found to robustly track changes in ecosystem function caused by fishing. We found that the lower F scenarios produced an ecologically distinct ecosystem state compared with the higher F scenarios, where relatively higher levels of fishing mortality (particularly on predators such as the deep Serranidae group) resulted in an increase in prey availability in later years of the simulation. This led to an increase in the overall productivity of the ecosystem over time and higher catch and biomass of most other reef fish groups at equilibrium (year 50).

The three alternative management strategies were: i) increase the cost of effort by eliminating the fuel tax exemption currently in place, ii) limit the nominal effort level (days at sea) to current levels, in order to offset the increasing trend observed in the last decade, and iii) change the selectivity patterns of the trawl by increasing mesh size. Our results show that for the two stocks analyzed, any of the three management measures (input controls) would be beneficial both to the stock and the fleets (over the medium and long terms) when compared with the projections over time of the status quo. Improving the selectivity of the fishing gear is more beneficial than limiting nominal effort or increasing the cost of effort. Comparing the performance of the management strategies on two stocks, one heavily fished and the other moderately so, we show that none of these management measures is able to substantially redress the situation of a heavily fished stock, implying that for the full recovery of heavily fished red shrimp stocks, we need to contemplate even stricter measures of management. © EDP Sciences, IFREMER, IRD 2006.",English,Article,,Scopus,,Catalan Sea,Europe,"50,000-100,000",multidecadal,"50,000-100,000",year,Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey_Fisheries  Dependent Data,3,3,3,,,Task 6.4 - targets and limits for indicators in an ecosystem context_Task 6.5 - management strategies,MEFISTO,MEFISTO,Multi-stock (without species interactions),red shrimp (Aristeus antennatus)_Merluccius merluccius_greater fork-beard (Phycis blennoides)_conger eel (Conger conger)_monk fish (Lophius sp.).,Age structured,multi-fleet/metier,demersal,Yes,Spatially implicit,No,,Input  control,No,Biological,SSB_F,yes,VIT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_0895,Romagnoni,F.

The model is composed of two groups of primary producers (coral and algae), herbivores (herbivorous fishes and sea urchins) and carnivores (piscivores and predators of invertebrates). Gross and net primary production are calculated from coral and algal production and respiration parameters, while the calcium carbonate balance is calculated from deposition by coral and algae and erosion by sea urchins and herbivorous fish. Simulation results indicate that fishing affects the coral reef's ecology and the benefits of the fisheries yield must be weighed against impacts on reef structure and processes. The model predicts that removing all fish groups will eventually result in reef dominance by sea urchins once their predators have been removed. This results in a rapid and dramatic drop in fisheries yields and reduced algal and coral biomass and productivity. Net calcium carbonate deposition is particularly sensitive to the effect of sea urchins or fishermen on living coral. Fishing only piscivores results in low fisheries yields but high reef accretion by indirectly releasing coral from competition with algae. A management strategy of fishing only piscivores and herbivorous fishes results in the highest and most stable fisheries yields. However, under this management strategy, high levels of fishing results in increased algae that competitively exclude coral and produces a temporary reduction in calcium carbonate deposition. But, at the highest algal biomass, calcium carbonate deposition is high and solely attributable to algal deposition. Nonetheless, this form of calcium carbonate deposition may not provide the reef structure required for fish habitat and shoreline protection. It may therefore prove beneficial, over the long term, to keep fishing below this level.",English,Article,,WOS,,"General model, tested on Kenyan Reef Lagoons",Africa,'NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT',Other [field data from Kenyan Reef Lagoons],3,2,3,"The model predicts that

However, the difference between theory and practice is substantial, as there are very few actual resource management programs that represent formal applications of decision analysis. We applied the process of structured decision making to Atlantic horseshoe crab harvest decisions in the Delaware Bay region to develop a multispecies adaptive management (AM) plan, which is currently being implemented. Horseshoe crab harvest has been a controversial management issue since the late 1990s. A largely unregulated horseshoe crab harvest caused a decline in crab spawning abundance. That decline coincided with a major decline in migratory shorebird populations that consume horseshoe crab eggs on the sandy beaches of Delaware Bay during spring migration. Our approach incorporated multiple stakeholders, including fishery and shorebird conservation advocates, to account for diverse management objectives and varied opinions on ecosystem function. Through consensus building, we devised an objective statement and quantitative objective function to evaluate alternative crab harvest policies. We developed a set of competing ecological models accounting for the leading hypotheses on the interaction between shorebirds and horseshoe crabs. The models were initially weighted based on stakeholder confidence in these hypotheses, but weights will be adjusted based on monitoring and Bayesian model weight updating. These models were used together to predict the effects of management actions on the crab and shorebird populations. Finally, we used a dynamic optimization routine to identify the state dependent optimal harvest policy for horseshoe crabs, given the possible actions, the stated objectives and our competing hypotheses about system function. The AM plan was reviewed, accepted and implemented by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission in 2012 and 2013. While disagreements among stakeholders persist, structured decision making enabled unprecedented progress towards a transparent and consensus driven management plan for crabs and shorebirds in Delaware Bay. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",English,Article,,Scopus,,Delaware Bay,North America,">100,000",decade,'NOT RELEVANT',year,Fisheries Dependent Data,'NOT RELEVANT',3,3,"A detailed report of the Sructured decision Making adaptive management (SDM-AM) process that has been applied to the management of horseshoe crab in Dalawage Bay, in which large number of stakeholders are involved in the management process from formulating the objective to making management decisions.

Most fisheries assessments focus on the biological capacity of fish stocks to respond to harvesting and few have attempted to estimate the economic efficiency at which ecosystems are exploited. The latter is important as fisheries contribute considerably to the economic development of many coastal communities. Here we estimate the overall potential economic rent for the fishing industry in the North Atlantic to be Be 12.85, compared to current estimated profits of BE 0.63. The difference between the potential and the net profits obtained from North Atlantic fisheries is therefore Be 12.22. In order to increase the profits of North Atlantic fisheries to a maximum, total fish biomass would have to be rebuilt to 108 Mt (2.4 times more than present) by reducing current total fishing effort by 53%. Stochastic simulations were undertaken to estimate the uncertainty associated with the aggregate bioeconomic model that we use and we estimate the economic loss NA fisheries in a range of 2.5 and 32 billion of euro. We provide economic justification for maintaining or restoring fish stocks to above their MSY biomass levels. Our conclusions are consistent with similar global scale studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The use of static gears close to the coast, where seasonal variability and spatial heterogeneity are high, promotes the diversification of fishing practices or metiers. We analyze the seasonal dynamics of the nets used, target species (red and black scorpionfish, red mullet and cuttlefish) exploitation patterns and the socio-economic conditions under which this fishery takes place, based on General Fisheries Directorate daily sale records (2002-2006). Additional personal socioeconomic interviews allowed the characterization of the trammel net fishery, its fishing behaviour, cost structure and conflicts. Catch and effort data and market surveys are used to evaluate the level of exploitation of the target species and allowed describing Majorca trammel net fishery as an activity based on a sustainable resource.

We develop a conceptual model which applies this approach to the mitigation of marine megafauna by-catch in fisheries, going from defining an overarching goal with an associated quantitative target, through avoidance, minimization, remediation to offsetting. We demonstrate the framework's utility as a tool for structuring thinking and exposing uncertainties. We draw comparisons between debates ongoing in terrestrial situations and in by-catch mitigation, to show how insights from each could inform the other; these are the hierarchical nature of mitigation, out-of-kind offsets, research as an offset, incentivizing implementation of mitigation measures, societal limits and uncertainty. We explore how economic incentives could be used throughout the hierarchy to improve the achievement of by-catch goals. We conclude by highlighting the importance of clear agreed goals, of thinking beyond single species and individual jurisdictions to account for complex interactions and policy leakage, of taking uncertainty explicitly into account and of thinking creatively about approaches to by-catch mitigation in order to improve outcomes for conservation and fishers. We suggest that the framework set out here could be helpful in supporting efforts to improve by-catch mitigation efforts and highlight the need for a full empirical application to substantiate this. © 2018 The Authors.

However, few of the models integrate benthic and fish dynamics with the influence of external anthropogenic stressors, and virtually none is available as a user-friendly platform for non-scientist managers to easily access. We propose a new ecological model to assess the effects of simultaneous stressors on coral reef ecosystems which includes a dynamic representation of benthic and fish spatial processes, linked by their ecological feedbacks. SEAMANCORE is a two-dimensional model representing the dynamics of local coral reefs which can be used to explore the influence of bleaching, eutrophication, and fishing, including destructive fishing such as bomb and cyanide fishing. The model is coupled with a menu-based interface that allows users with no programming experience to simulate numerous scenarios in specific contexts that can be customized with depth profile maps and initial coral reef conditions of fish and benthos functional group abundance. This study includes SEAMANCORE's description and shows the model's sensitivity to its parameters by means of sensitivity analyses.

This is especially so for models of natural systems where experimental manipulation of the real-world to provide controlled validation data is not possible. End-to-end ecosystem models (nutrients to birds and mammals) of marine ecosystems fall into this category with applications for evaluating the effects of climate change and fishing on nutrient fluxes and the abundances of flora and fauna. Here we present results of both 'one-at-a-time' (OAT) and variance based global sensitivity analyses (GSA) of the fish and fishery aspects of StrathE2E, an end-to-end ecosystem model of the North Sea. The sensitivity of the model was examined with respect to internal biological parameters, and external drivers related to climate and human activity. The OAT Morris method was first used to screen for factors most influential on model outputs. The Sobol GSA method was then used to calculate quantitative sensitivity indices. The results indicated that the fish and shellfish components of the model (demersal and pelagic fish, filter/deposit and scavenge/carnivore feeding benthos) were influenced by different sets of factors. Harvesting rates were highly influential on demersal and pelagic fish biomasses. Suspension/deposit feeding benthos were directly sensitive to changes in temperature, while the temperature acted indirectly on pelagic fish through the connectivity between model components of the food web. Biomass conversion efficiency was the most important factor for scavenge/carnivorous feeding benthos. The results indicate the primacy of fishing as the most important process affecting total fish biomass, together with varying responses to environmental factors which may be relevant in the context of climate change.

Understanding these trade-offs can help managers reconcile conflicting goals. An example is a set of bycatch reduction measures for the Critically Endangered vaquita porpoise (Phocoena sinus), in the Northern Gulf of California, Mexico. The vaquita is an endemic species threatened with extinction by artisanal net bycatch within its limited range; in this area fisheries are the chief source of economic productivity. Methodology/Principal Findings: We analyze trade-offs between conservation of the vaquita and fisheries, using an end-to-end Atlantis ecosystem model for the Northern Gulf of California. Atlantis is a spatially-explicit model intended as a strategic tool to test alternative management strategies. We simulated increasingly restrictive fisheries regulations contained in the vaquita conservation plan: implementing progressively larger spatial management areas that exclude gillnets, shrimp driftnets and introduce a fishing gear that has no vaquita bycatch. We found that only the most extensive spatial management scenarios recovered the vaquita population above the threshold necessary to downlist the species from Critically Endangered. The scenario that excludes existing net gear from the 2008 area of vaquita distribution led to moderate decrease in net present value (US$ 42 million) relative to the best-performing scenario and a two-fold increase in the abundance of adult vaquita over the course of 30 years. Conclusions/Significance: Extended spatial management resulted in the highest recovery of the vaquita population. The economic cost of proposed management actions was unequally divided between fishing fleets; the loss of value from finfish gillnet fisheries was never recovered.

Mesopelagic fish may be vulnerable to deep entrained oil plumes of the type seen in the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill; even at low concentrations, exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) may cause lethal and sublethal effects, such as endocrine disruption, growth inhibition, and genetic damage. A reduction in the abundance of mesopelagic fish could potentially shift predation pressure by large pelagics to epipelagic forage or other species, with potential fisheries consequences. We explored this hypothesis on the West Florida Shelf using an Atlantis model for the Gulf of Mexico. Atlantis is a 3-dimensional, spatially explicit marine and coastal modeling framework that incorporates multiple submodels integrating biophysical, chemical, ecological, and fisheries dynamics.

This study aims to: (i) analyse the trophic functioning of the Celtic Sea and the Bay of Biscay, (ii) investigate ecosystem changes over the 1980Ð2013 period and, (iii) explore the response to management measures at the food web scale. Ecopath models were built for each ecosystem for years 1980 and 2013, and Ecosim models were fitted to time series data of biomass and catches. EcoTroph diagnosis showed that in both ecosystems, fishing pressure focuses on high trophic levels (TLs) and, to a lesser extent, on intermediate TLs. However, the interplay between local environmental conditions, species composition and ecosystem functioning could explain the different responses to fisheries management observed between these two contiguous ecosystems. Indeed, over the study period, the ecosystem's exploitation status has improved in the Bay of Biscay but not in the Celtic Sea. This improvement does not seem to be sufficient to achieve the objectives of an EAFM, as high trophic levels were still overexploited in 2013 and simulations conducted with Ecosim in the Bay of Biscay indicate that at current fishing effort the biomass will not be rebuilt by 2030. The ecosystem's response to a reduction in fishing mortality depends on which trophic levels receive protection. Reducing fishing mortality on pelagic fish, instead of on demersal fish, appears more efficient at maximising catch and total biomass and at conserving both top-predator and intermediate TLs. Such advice-oriented trophic models should be used on a regular basis to monitor the health status of marine food webs and analyse the trade-offs between multiple objectives in an ecosystem-based fisheries management context. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,,Scopus,,"Celtic Sea, Bay of Biscay",Europe,">100,000",year,'NOT RELEVANT',year,Other (Multiple methods),'NOT RELEVANT',2,3,"In the present study, we showed how trophic models, especially Ecopath with Ecosim as well as EcoTroph, are key tools to implement EAFM.

It is argued that it may be just as important to test the sensitivity of policy recommendations to uncertain assumptions. However, in complex dynamic models, policy recommendations typically have elements of randomness and possibly subjectivity. This problem is avoided by using optimisation to identify unique policies for different model assumptions. The case is a cod fishery for which a quota policy combined with a simple capacity policy is investigated. It is found that the policies are not very sensitive to the choice of biological model (aggregated or age classes), while they are highly sensitive to uncertain assumptions about nonlinear economic relationships.

The Council's EAFM decision framework first uses risk assessment to prioritize fishery-ecosystem interactions for consideration. The Council's 2017 EAFM risk assessment identified a range of ecological, social, and management objectives or risk elements. Development of a conceptual model to identify key environmental, ecological, social, economic, and management linkages for a high-priority fishery is the second step in the framework. The Council identified summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) as a high-risk fishery and finalized an EAFM conceptual model that considers high-risk factors and ecosystem elements in 2019. The Council used the conceptual model to identify three priority summer flounder management questions (recreational data uncertainty, recreational discards, and distribution shifts) to be considered for quantitative management strategy evaluation, the third step in the EAFM framework and set to begin in 2020. Finally, as strategies are implemented, outcomes are monitored and the process is adjusted, and/or other priorities identified in the risk assessment can be addressed.

The fishing sector, in the Alboran Sea, is economically and culturally one of the most important and relies on overexploited target species such as European hake (Merlucius merlucius). Here we identified and quantified the impact of human pressures on the capacity of marine habitats to support the provision of food as an important ecosystem service. We modelled the spatial distribution of nursery areas of European hake in the Alboran Sea, using General Additive Models (GAM) and overlaid those with European Nature Information System (EUNIS) habitats. A sensitivity analysis of hake nursery areas to cumulative human impacts identified the Bay of Malaga as the most sensitive area with trawling frequencies up to 60 times higher than the habitats recovery time. Further, we identified an increased conflict potential among human activities such as trawling and extraction with the presence of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), which provide MPAs a high vulnerability similar to that found in unprotected areas. Future scenarios considering the increase of renewable energy and alternative food production show conflicts between aquaculture and MPAs as well as offshore wind farms and offshore shipping. Hence, our results show strong arguments for an integrated spatial management approach, including benthic trawling. We also suggest restricting trawling activities inside MPAs to safeguard the habitats capacity to support ecosystem services. Our spatially explicit assessment framework is transparent and transferable to other Mediterranean regions.

In response, ecological indicators have been developed to assess the state of reef fisheries and their broader ecosystem-level impacts. To date, use of fisheries indicators for coral reefs has been rather piecemeal, with no overarching understanding of their performance with respect to highlighting fishing effects. Here, we provide a review of multispecies fishery-independent indicators used to evaluate fishing impacts on coral reefs. We investigate the consistency with which indicators highlight fishing effects on coral reefs. We then address questions of statistical power and uncertainty, type of fishing gradient, scale of analysis, the influence of other variables and the need for more work to set reference points for empirical, fisheries-independent indicators on coral reefs.

In this paper, dynamic food web simulations are conducted to evaluate when and why ecological thresholds may be exceeded, and whether bottom-up forcing or fishing is more likely to induce irreversible ecosystem states. Simulations are conducted using a calibrated food web model of the upwelling system off central Chile (33-39 degrees S) and the Ecopath with Ecosim software version 5.1. The effects of fishing scenarios are explored by changing fishing mortality according to trophic level. The effects of bottom-up forcing scenarios are explored by changing phytoplankton biomass, as a function of sea temperature, at El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and decadal scales. Simulations are carried out for 150 years and impacts, system recovery and regime shifts from each scenario are evaluated using trophodynamic indicators and limit reference points for biomass of functional groups as proxies of food web state and ecological thresholds, respectively. Proportionally distributed fishing along trophic levels is the least harmful fishing scenario, resulting in biomass limit reference points rarely being exceeded and high system recovery. Concentrating fishing at higher and lower trophic levels more likely causes reference points to be exceeded and induces ecosystem changes with low-to-medium recovery potential. No limit reference points are exceeded (or regime shift induced) under ENSO-scale bottom-up forcing. Decadal scale bottom-up forcing has different effects on the system depending on the sequence in which the high and low phytoplankton biomass periods are simulated. A shift from low phytoplankton biomass towards high phytoplankton biomass does not result in biomass limit reference points being exceeded, whereas the opposite sequence results in a large number of limit reference points being exceeded with medium recovery. The interplay between fishing and decadal scale bottom-up forcing indicates that bottom-up forcing can dampen the effects of fishing, whereas fishing increases the number of limit reference points exceeded and decreases the recovery observed under decadal scale bottom-up forcing. Results suggest that fishing (especially unsustainable strategies) is more likely to cause ecological thresholds to be exceeded and to induce regime shifts of low recovery than decadal scale bottom-up forcing. We consider these results of relevance for the management of fisheries in their ecosystem context. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

An extended bio-economic model of a fishery is developed to include nutrient enrichment and built into a general model of the polluting and fishery sector with nutrient concentration and fish stock as state variables. The marginal damage function for nutrient enrichment is derived. This function can be compared with the marginal abatement cost and hence it provides a basis for policies that balance the use of nutrients in land-based industries (for example agriculture) with the external cost to the marine environment. The model is empirically applied to the case of the Baltic Sea, where Eastern Baltic cod fisheries are affected by nutrient enrichment. The results indicate that nitrogen loading needs to be reduced slightly (around 1 %) to reach optimal levels.

Model uncertainties grew particularly high in future climate change scenarios. For example, cod fishery recommendations that resulted in viable stocks in the original model failed after data uncertainties were introduced. In addition, addressing the trophic control dynamics produced by the food-web model proved as a useful tool for both model validation, and for studying the food-web function.

The Baltic Sea in Northern Europe is one of the systems most affected. In addition to being exposed to persistent eutrophication, intensive fishing, and one of the world's fastest rates of warming in the last two decades of the 20th century, accelerated climate change including atmospheric warming and changes in precipitation is projected for this region during the 21st century. Here, we used a new multimodel approach to project how the interaction of climate, nutrient loads, and cod fishing may affect the future of the open Central Baltic Sea food web. Regionally downscaled global climate scenarios were, in combination with three nutrient load scenarios, used to drive an ensemble of three regional biogeochemical models (BGMs).

By the end of the 21st century, for example, the combination of intensive cod fishing and high nutrient loads projected a strongly eutrophicated and sprat-dominated ecosystem, whereas low cod fishing in combination with low nutrient loads resulted in a cod-dominated ecosystem with eutrophication levels close to present. Also, nonlinearities were observed in the sensitivity of different trophic groups to nutrient loads or fishing depending on the combination of the two.

This is particularly true in the oceans where spatial scales of management are often mismatched with spatially complex metapopulations. We explore causes, consequences, and potential solutions for spatial mismatches in harvested metapopulations in three ways. First, we generate novel theory illustrating when and how harvesting metapopulations increases spatial variability and in turn masks local-scale volatility. Second, we illustrate why spatial variability in harvested metapopulations leads to negative consequences using an empirical example of a Pacific herring metapopulation. Finally, we construct a numerical management strategy evaluation model to identify and highlight potential solutions for mismatches in spatial scale and spatial variability. Our results highlight that spatial complexity can promote stability at large scales, however, ignoring spatial complexity produces cryptic and negative consequences for people and animals that interact with resources at small scales. Harvesting metapopulations magnifies spatial variability, which creates discrepancies between regional and local trends while increasing risk of local population collapses. Such effects asymmetrically impact locally constrained fishers and predators, which are more exposed to risks of localized collapses. Importantly, we show that dynamically optimizing harvest can minimize local risk without sacrificing yield. Thus, multiple nested scales of management may be necessary to avoid cryptic collapses in metapopulations and the ensuing ecological, social, and economic consequences. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America",English,Article,,Scopus,,British Colombia's Central Coast,South America,"50,000-100,000",'NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT',Physiological Growth Indicators_Fisheries Dependent Data_Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey,2,2,3,"Harvest strategies that appear appropriately prescribed at large spatial scales can, at local scales, lead to declines or even effective extirpation of local populations.

In the California Current, predatory lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus) populations recovered rapidly from fishing exploitation over the past two decades, while recovery of some rockfish species (Sebastes spp.) has been slow, mainly because of low natural productivities. One management tool has been the adoption of rockfish conservation areas (RCAs) that prohibit bottom contact fishing gear. Because lingcod also inhabit RCAs, fishers have been unable to catch their sustainable lingcod quotas. Therefore, we explored the conditions under which opening RCAs to a selective lingcod fishery might permit rockfish recovery despite the potential bycatch. We developed a joint equilibrium model of the two populations and analysed scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the model's predictions to key uncertainties. The model suggests a wide range of fishery and ecological conditions under which a lingcod fishery may not harm rockfish populations. However, a sensitivity analysis indicated that the range of fishing scenarios where rockfish are not harmed is highly sensitive to assumptions regarding the nature of the trophic linkage between lingcod and rockfish. We conclude that consideration of trophic interactions may reveal new fishing opportunities that meet both ecological and human goals, but precise predictions of the outcomes will require more detailed models and adaptive management. © 2016 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2016.

However, users can dampen this variability by harvesting a portfolio of resources. In the context of fisheries, this means targeting multiple populations, though the ability to actually build diverse fishing portfolios is often constrained by the costs and availability of fishing permits. These constraints are generally intended to prevent overcapitalization of the fleet and ensure populations are fished sustainably. As linked human-natural systems, both ecological and fishing dynamics influence the specific advantages and disadvantages of increasing the diversity of fishing portfolios. Specifically, a portfolio of synchronous populations with similar responses to environmental drivers should reduce revenue variability less than a portfolio of asynchronous populations with opposite responses. We built a bioeconomic model based on the Dungeness crab (Metacarcinus magister), Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), and groundfish fisheries in the California Current, and used it to explore the influence of population synchrony and permit access on income patterns. As expected, synchronous populations reduced revenue variability less than asynchronous populations, but only for portfolios including crab and salmon. Synchrony with the longer-lived groundfish population was not important because environmentally driven changes in groundfish recruitment were mediated by growth and natural mortality over the full population age structure, and overall biomass was relatively stable across years. Thus, building a portfolio of diverse life histories can buffer against the impacts of poor environmental conditions over short time scales. Increasing access to all permits generally led to increased revenue stability and decreased inequality of the fleet, but also resulted in less revenue earned by an individual from a given portfolio because more vessels shared the available biomass. This means managers are faced with a trade-off between the average revenue individuals earn and the risk those individuals accept.

Ecosystem models can inform management of human activities in a complex and changing environment, but are these models reliable? Ensuring that models are reliable for addressing management questions requires evaluating their skill in representing real-world processes and dynamics. Skill has been evaluated for just a limited set of some biophysical models. A range of skill assessment methods have been reviewed but skill assessment of full marine ecosystem models has not yet been attempted. Northeast US Atlantis Marine Ecosystem Model We assessed the skill of the Northeast U.S. (NEUS) Atlantis marine ecosystem model by comparing 10-year model forecasts with observed data. Model forecast performance was compared to that obtained from a 40-year hindcast. Multiple metrics (average absolute error, root mean squared error, modeling efficiency, and Spearman rank correlation), and a suite of time-series (species biomass, fisheries landings, and ecosystem indicators) were used to adequately measure model skill. Overall, the NEUS model performed above average and thus better than expected for the key species that had been the focus of the model tuning. Model forecast skill was comparable to the hindcast skill, showing that model performance does not degenerate in a 10-year forecast mode, an important characteristic for an end-to-end ecosystem model to be useful for strategic management purposes. Skill Assessment Is Both Possible and Advisable We identify best-practice approaches for end-to-end ecosystem model skill assessment that would improve both operational use of other ecosystem models and future model development. We show that it is possible to not only assess the skill of a complicated marine ecosystem model, but that it is necessary do so to instill confidence in model results and encourage their use for strategic management. Our methods are applicable to any type of predictive model, and should be considered for use in fields outside ecology (e.g. economics, climate change, and risk assessment).",English,Article,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",WOS,Not relevant to fisheries management evaluation models,,,,,,,,3,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_1020,BIOR,"Olsen, E; Kaplan, IC; Ainsworth, C; Fay, G; Gaichas, S; Gamble, R; Girardin, R; Eide, CH; Ihde, TF; Morzaria-Luna, HN; Johnson, KF; Savina-Rolland, M; Townsend, H; Weijerman, M; Fulton, EA; Link, JS","Ocean Futures Under Ocean Acidification, Marine Protection, and Changing Fishing Pressures Explored Using a Worldwide Suite of Ecosystem Models",2018,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,5,,,,10.3389/fmars.2018.00064,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2018.00064,"Ecosystem-based management (EBM) of the ocean considers all impacts on and uses of marine and coastal systems.

Of the drivers examined in this study, warming had the greatest effect on species biomass, with mainly negative effects. The magnitude of the impacts of warming intensified from the RCP 2.6 to the 8.5 emission scenario. Fishing negatively affected demersal and large pelagic fish, which in turn resulted in a biomass increase of forage fish due to a decrease in predation pressure. Water mixing was found to have minor indirect effects on zooplankton biomass and fish. The responses of species and species groups to the combined effects of fishing and warming were approximately equally divided between additive, synergistic and antagonistic. Interpretation of our model results suggests that the southern Benguela system is likely to be affected by climate change, including substantial changes in the abundance of some species important to the region's fisheries. Future planning for fisheries needs to take this into account, including through management that strives to maintain the resilience of key species and the system as a whole. In line with previous studies on the southern Benguela, the results reinforce the importance of including consideration of the indirect and combined impacts of climate change and fishing in management and planning. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",English,Article,,Scopus,,southern Benguela upwelling system,Africa,">100,000",multidecadal,'NOT RELEVANT',year,Simulated dynamics_other(details of sampling method not provided in this paper),2,1,2,"Notwithstanding uncertainties and other limitations in the model, our simulations provide good evidence that the southern Benguela system is likely to be substantially affected by warming as a result of climate change.

Three fishing strategies were modelled to represent a variety of ways of targeting fishing within an ecosystem: one focused on low trophic levels (i.e. forage species), another on higher trophic levels (i.e. predatory fish) and a third tested fishing pressure across the full range of potentially exploitable species. Two types of environmental change were simulated for each fishing mortality scenario random environmental variability and directional climate change. The specificity of selected ecological indicators (mean trophic level of the community, proportion of predatory fish, biomass/landings, mean intrinsic vulnerability and marine trophic index) was evaluated for different combinations of fishing strategy, fishing mortality and both types of environmental change. While there were mostly large differences in indicator values computed from the Atlantis and Ecosim models, the specificity of the ecological indicators considered under changing climate generally corresponded between the two models.

Despite this harvest pressure, few studies have attempted to establish a more holistic, systems-based management plan. On the contrary, research continues to rely on population models in which the species of interest are isolated from their ecological context. This work offers several keystone indices in order to help multispecies fisheries management. The indices used are: (1) functional indices based on steady-state and dynamic trophic models; (2) structural indices based on bottom-up and top-down control mechanisms; and (3) qualitative keystone species indices using loop models (mixed control). The quantitative trophic models were constructed using Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE; v. 5.0) software, and the qualitative model was analysed using Loop Analysis. All models describe the interactions of the most representative species and functional groups inhabiting the benthic ecosystems of Tongoy Bay, La Rinconada Marine Reserve (Antofagasta Bay), and the kelp forest of Mejillones Peninsula (Antofagasta). Even though our results only represent the short-term dynamics of these systems, we have found keystoneness properties of several species and functional groups, including primary producers, herbivores, and top predators. Despite this wide variability of groups, we detected a different core set of species or functional groups, each of which contained prey-predator and plant-herbivore relationships. Because the traditional keystone concept of a single species is difficult to apply, we suggest shifting away from this view towards a more holistic alternative such as that of a keystone species complex. This kind of approach would facilitate the design and assessment of sustainable management strategies for ecological marine ecosystems. Despite the ecological relevance of our results, further experimental studies and modelling using other theoretical frameworks should be performed. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Levins's loop analysis was used as a methodological framework for assessing the local stability (considered as a component of sustainability) of the modeled management interventions represented by various scenarios. The results provided by models of different complexity (models 1 through 4) showed that a reduction of coral species cover would drive the system to unstable states. In the absence of the alien lionfish, the simultaneous fishing of large benthic epifaunal species, adult herbivorous fish and adult carnivorous fish could be sustainable only if the coral species present high levels of cover (models 2 and 3). Once the lionfish is added to the simulations (models 4 and 5), the analysis suggests that although the exploitation or removal of lionfish from shallow waters may be locally stable, it remains necessary to implement additional and concurrent human interventions that increase the holistic sustainability of the control strategy. The supplementary interventions would require the implementation of programs for: (1) the restoration of corals for increasing their cover, (2) the exploitation or removal of lionfish from deeper waters (decreasing the chance of source/sink meta-population dynamics) and (3) the implementation of bans and re-stocking programs for carnivorous fishes (such as grouper) that increase the predation and competition pressure on lionfish (i.e. biological control). An effective control management for the alien lionfish at Chinchorro bank should not be optimized for a single action plan: instead, we should investigate the concurrent implementation of multiple strategies. © 2015 Ortiz et al.

We use an ecosystem model (Ecopath with Ecosim, EwE) to show that reduced top-down control (seal predation) and increased bottom-up forcing (eutrophication) can largely explain the historical dynamics of the main fish stocks (cod, herring and sprat) in the Baltic Sea between 1900 and 1980. Based on these results and the historical fish stock development we identify two major ecological transitions. A shift from seal to cod domination was caused by a virtual elimination of marine mammals followed by a shift from an oligotrophic to a eutrophic state. A third shift from cod to clupeid domination in the late 1980s has previously been explained by overfishing of cod and climatic changes. We propose that the shift from an oligotrophic to a eutrophic state represents a true regime shift with a stabilizing mechanism for a hysteresis phenomenon. There are also mechanisms that could stabilize the shift from a cod to clupeid dominated ecosystem, but there are no indications that the ecosystem has been pushed that far yet. We argue that the shifts in the Baltic Sea are a consequence of human impacts, although variations in climate may have influenced their timing, magnitude and persistence. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",English,Article,,Scopus,,Baltic Sea,Europe,">100,000",multidecadal,'NOT RELEVANT',year,Other (multiple sources),2,2,3,,,Task 6.2 - climatic and ecological effects on the impact of fisheries management,EwE,EwE,Ecosystem model,Functional groups,Biomass aggregated,multi-fleet/metier,not specified,No,No spatial context,Yes,consumption/biomass rate (Q/B),No management measures,No,Ecosystem based,relative biomass,yes,EwE,We identify two major ecological transitions.

In fisheries, we see transdisciplinary approaches being employed to address a range of challenges, including bycatch where fine-scale data are collected by fishers to help advance spatial approaches in which fishing effort is shifted away from bycatch hotspots. However, the spatio-temporal overlap of morphologically undistinguishable fish stocks, some of which are depleted, is a major concern for some fisheries, including the Pacific Northwest troll Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) fishery. In this study, we develop and evaluate a transdisciplinary approach to avoid bycatch in the commercial Chinook salmon troll fishery off northern and central Oregon. Based on a unique genetic dataset collected by fishers, fine-scale patterns of stock distribution and spatial stock overlap were assessed. Two hotspots of weak Klamath stock in the study region were identified and related to bathymetry. Results were then fed into a simple bioeconomic model to evaluate costs and benefits of reallocating effort under two scenarios of allowable catch of a weak stock (Klamath). The scenarios demonstrate that effort reallocation could lead to a reduction in Klamath catch as well as to increases in net profit, but outcomes depend on the distance from the fleets' home port to the new fishing area. The output of the model at its current stage should be regarded strategically, providing a qualitative understanding of the types of best fleet strategies. Despite some challenges in transdisciplinarity discussed in this study and the present limitations to incorporate fine-scale changes of Chinook salmon stock distributions in management regulations, we contend that this approach to research has the potential to lead to improved management outcomes. © 2016 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2016.

Together they produced a static mass balance model for 1998 when the prey surveys began. The Ecopath-estimated monk seal biomass was 0.0045 t/km2, which was in close agreement with the biomass calculated from monk seal field beach counts (0.0046 t/km2). Model simulations through time were done in Ecosim using the Ecopath balanced model and included fisheries data time series from 1998 to 2008.

Fundamental to Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM) and Ecosystem-Based Fisheries management (EBFM) is the need to engage relevant stakeholder groups. Here we present a Bayesian network (BN) tool developed to describe the snapper population in the Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand, and investigate possible outcomes of alternative management scenarios on snapper abundance. The Hauraki Gulf is a location where the marine environment is both highly valued and in high demand for the goods and services it provides. Snapper are a key component of this social-ecological system. We developed a BN focussed on key snapper life stages, and the consequences of stressors, including fishing, uses of marine space, land use practises (which influence sediment and nutrient yield), biogenic and environmental habitat variables, and upper level drivers such as climate change, human population growth and the global economy. Parameters were populated through a range of information types, from empirical and model analysis to literature review and expert opinion. Parameters for the core of the BN model (i.e. the snapper life stages and fishing methods) were adjusted so that the predicted effects of fishing reflected those seen in model projections from an age structured population model that had recently been used to inform the management of the snapper population in the Hauraki Gulf. The two most influential factors within this BN were fishing and land-use practises. Although there was a strong impact on snapper populations from land-use practises and resulting sedimentation that detrimentally affects biogenic habitats that juvenile snapper depend on, the potential impact of fishery extraction was much stronger. While fishery extraction of snapper is generally well managed, under the existing management set up it is also the only major stressor that would likely be regulated in response to decreases in the snapper population (regardless of the source of any impact).

This has recently become an issue for the Northern Prawn Fishery, in which bioeconomic modelling is used to set management limits. Modelling has focused on the tiger prawn component of the fishery, which mostly occurs in the second half of the year. However, successful management leading to stock recovery has resulted in this fishery now overlapping temporally with the banana prawn fishery, which occurs in the first half of the year. Ideally, an integrated model covering the whole year would be developed, but this is not practical for a number of reasons. In this study, we model the factors driving the level of fishing effort in the banana prawn fishery, which affects, and is affected by, the tiger prawn fishery. As expected, banana prawn fishing effort is driven largely by stock size, fleet size, catch rates, prices, and fuel costs. Effort increases with fleet size, but at a decreasing rate.

This has largely been interpreted as maximising the net economic yield (MEY) in fisheries. More recently, the influence of reducing yields to achieve MEY on prices and the transfer of consumer surplus to producers has been raised as a potential issue, Achieving fishery MEY may result in a reduction in net economic returns in a broader sense if the loss to consumers exceeds the gain to the industry. The transfer of consumer surplus to producers is also potentially undesirable, and may result in a dead weight loss. Similarly, the disutility associated with bycatch in fisheries may also affect our interpretation of optimal yields if non monetary values are considered. These externalities are generally not considered in determining MEY. In this paper, we develop a generic multispecies bioeconomic model that is used to estimate the impact of broadening the consideration of net economic returns to include changes in consumer surplus as well as the inclusion of non market values associated with bycatch.

In many cases, these fish are commercial species that, if not caught, could increase the productivity of other fisheries. In January 2003, European legislation was implemented by Member States requiring all vessels fishing for brown shrimp to use selective trawls in order to minimise the bycatch of other commercial species. In complying with the regulations, however, the catch rate of the target species ( the shrimp) is likely to be reduced. In this paper, we use a bioeconomic model to assess the impact of bycatch reduction devices on fishing effort, catch and profitability in the European Crangon fisheries. The potential benefits ( in terms of higher future yields and consequently higher profits) to the whitefish fisheries are also estimated.

However, an even greater number of fisheries are relatively data poor, and development of traditional bioeconomic models is not feasible. For small-scale fisheries, the cost of data collection and model development may exceed the additional value these models may generate. Fisheries biologists have grappled with similar issues and have developed a range of data-poor methods for estimating reference points related to fishing mortality based on life history characteristics and other indicators. In other cases, catch and effort data may be sufficient to estimate sustainable biomass levels. However, model-derived economic target reference points require robust biological models as well as appropriate economic information, both of which are often unavailable. In this paper, we extend the data-poor work to move from biological to economic target reference points for single-species fisheries. We show that the relationship between economic (maximum economic yield) and biological (maximum sustainable yield) reference points depends primarily on the cost : revenue ratio, and that, where unavailable, these can be inferred from fisheries characteristics. We show that good estimates of biomass- and effort-based economic target reference points can be achieved with limited data.Received September 4, 2013; accepted August 10, 2014",English,Article,"gold, Green Submitted",WOS,Not relevant to fisheries management evaluation models,,,,,,,,,,,,"It is not a simulation model, it is an analysis to estimate the relationship btw MSY and MEY",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_1064,WU_Binch,B.

However, vessel catch rates are predicted fall and economic conditions worsen, which is of particular concern for those smaller-scale fleets within Pacific island countries and territories that rely on this stock for income and employment. We examine candidate target reference points that might achieve wider management objectives integrating across multiple plausible states of nature using a deterministic bio-economic model, and potential implications of those targets for the stock and fisheries through stochastic stock projections. Maximum sustainable yield (MSY), the 'default' reference point within the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, implied a relatively low stock size and more than a 1-in-3 chance of the stock falling below the limit reference point. Minimum target levels, defined by the permissible level of risk (5-20%) of falling below the limit reference point, implied larger stock sizes than at MSY, but a halving in longline catch rates that would lead to increased social and economic hardship.

However, vessel catch rates are predicted fall and economic conditions worsen, which is of particular concern for those smaller-scale fleets within Pacific island countries and territories that rely on this stock for income and employment. We examine candidate target reference points that might achieve wider management objectives integrating across multiple plausible states of nature using a deterministic bio-economic model, and potential implications of those targets for the stock and fisheries through stochastic stock projections. Maximum sustainable yield (MSY), the 'default' reference point within the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, implied a relatively low stock size and more than a 1-in-3 chance of the stock falling below the limit reference point. Minimum target levels, defined by the permissible level of risk (5-20%) of falling below the limit reference point, implied larger stock sizes than at MSY, but a halving in longline catch rates that would lead to increased social and economic hardship. These results suggest that economic, rather than biological, requirements will provide the standards for an albacore target reference point. However, achieving maximum economic yield (MEY) implied severe reductions in effort, likely incompatible with objectives for employment within the local fishery sector or the level of vessel licensing revenue.

An aggregated biomass-based simulation model of a Mediterranean infralittoral zone was developed and used to carry out fishing 'experiments' where fishing intensity and catch selection were varied. The model was constructed for the Bay of Calvi, Corsica, using the Ecopath with Ecosim software, and was composed of 27 compartments, including seabirds, 11 groups of fish, 12 groups of invertebrates, 2 primary producers, bacteria and detritus. Several instances of indirect fishing effects ('trophic cascades' and 'keystone predation') have been proposed from anecdotal evidence in the western Mediterranean. Model outcomes provided little support for the widely accepted paradigm that fishing, by removing invertebrate-feeding fish, allows increases in the biomass of sea urchins and as a consequence the formation of overgrazed 'barrens' of bare substrate. Simulated harvesting of sea urchins by humans did, however, results in an increase of macroalgal biomass as reported previously. Intensified fishing pressure on 'macrocarnivorous' fish resulted in a 'release' of small fish species (e.g. blennies), and as a consequence a decline in the biomass of some small invertebrates on which they feed (e.g. amphipods). Increased fishing on large 'piscivores' resulted in increases in other small fish groups and consequential effects on other benthic invertebrate groups (e.g. polychaetes). Depletion of piscivorous fish resulted in a dramatic increase in the biomass of seabirds, which apparently compete with piscivores for small demersal and pelagic fish. An intensification of fishing pressure overall resulted in an increase in cephalopod biomass. Responses of target species to increased fishing pressure were most marked within the first 5 years of the new fishing regime. Indirect responses exhibited varying degrees of inertia, and biomasses of many groups did not assume a new equilibrium within the first 20 years of the simulation. The Mediterranean infralittoral rocky-bottom ecosystem was predicted to be relatively resilient to pulses of increased fishing and exhibited a high degree of detritus recycling. However, the speed and magnitude of ecosystem responses was shown to depend greatly on the extent of 'top-down' or 'bottom-up' control assumed for components within the system.

This paper analyzes the stability and success of these organizations through a game in partition function form based on the classical Gordon-Schaefer bioeconomic model. Results show that the larger the number of fishing states that compete for the fish stock the higher are the relative gains from full cooperation, but the lower is the likelihood of large RFMOs being stable. It is also shown that new entrants increase the incentives of RFMO members to leave and decrease the incentives of non-members to join it.

These large-scale studies estimated impacts on benthos (particularly removal rates per trawl pass), monitored subsequent recovery rates, measured natural dynamics of tagged megabenthos, mapped the regional distribution of seabed habitats and benthic species, and integrated these results in a dynamic modelling framework together with spatio-temporal fishery effort data and simulated management. Typical impact rates were between 5 and 25% per trawl, recovery times ranged from several years to several decades, and most sessile megabenthos were naturally distributed in areas where little or no trawling occurred and so had low exposure to trawling. The model simulated trawl impact and recovery on the mapped species distributions, and estimated the regional scale cumulative changes due to trawling as a time series of status for megabenthos species. The regional status of these taxa at time of greatest depletion ranged from ?77% relative to pre-trawl abundance for the worst case species, having slow recovery with moderate exposure to trawling, to ?97% for the least affected taxon. The model also evaluated the expected outcomes for sessile megabenthos in response to major management interventions implemented between 1999 and 2006, including closures, effort reductions, and protected areas. As a result of these interventions, all taxa were predicted to recover (by 2-14% at 2025); the most affected species having relatively greater recovery. Effort reductions made the biggest positive contributions to benthos status for all taxa, with closures making smaller contributions for some taxa. The results demonstrated that management actions have arrested and reversed previous unsustainable trends for all taxa assessed, and have led to a prawn trawl fishery with improved environmental sustainability. © 2015 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2015.

The method combines semi-quantitative (e.g. ecological) and qualitative (e.g. social) data via multiple evaluation fields, each of which is assessed through scores assigned to six to 12 attributes or indicators: the scoring method allows user flexibility to adopt a wide range of utility relationships. For assessing sustainability, six evaluation fields have been developed: ecological, technological, economic, social, ethical and institutional. Each field can be assessed directly with a set of scored attributes, or several of the fields can be dealt with in greater detail using nested subfields that themselves comprise multidimensional Rapfish assessments (e.g. the hierarchical institutional field encompasses both governance and management, including a detailed analysis of legality). The user has the choice of including all or only some of the available sustainability fields. For the attributes themselves, there will rarely be quantitative data, but scoring allows these items to be estimated. Indeed, within a normative framework, one important advantage with Rapfish is transparency of the rigour, quality and replicability of the scores. The Rapfish technique employs a constrained multidimensional ordination that is scaled to situate data points within evaluation space.

Krill (Euphausia superba) is a keystone species in the Antarctic, serving as a fundamental forage source for predators and simultaneously being subject to fishing. We developed a spatial multispecies operating model (SMOM) of krill-predator fishery dynamics to help advise on allocation of the total krill catch among 15 small-scale management units (SSMUs) in the Scotia Sea, with a goal to reduce the potential impact of fishing on krill predators. The operating model describes the underlying population dynamics and is used in simulations to compare different management options for adjusting fishing activities (e.g., a different spatial distribution of catches). The numerous uncertainties regarding the choice of parameter values pose a major impediment to constructing reliable ecosystem models. The pragmatic solution proposed here involves the use of operating models that are composed of alternative combinations of parameters that essentially try to bound the uncertainty in, for example, the choice of survival rate estimates as well as the functional relationships between predators and prey. Despite the large uncertainties, it is possible to discriminate the ecosystem impacts of different spatial fishing allocations. The spatial structure of the model is fundamental to addressing concerns of localized depletion of prey in the vicinity of land-based predator breeding colonies. Results of the model have been considered in recent management deliberations for spatial allocations of krill catches in the Scotia Sea and their associated impacts on dependent predator species. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.",English,Article,,Scopus,,Scotia Sea,Europe,">100,000",multidecadal,'NOT RELEVANT',year,Other ( various sources of data collections ),2,2,3,"Despite the large uncertainties, it is possible to discriminate the ecosystem impacts of different spatial fishing allocations.

Vulnerability assessments, in this regard, can be used to support fisheries decision-making by aiding species prioritization. Assessments like Productivity-Susceptibility Analyses are well suited for multispecies fisheries, with low gear selectivity and insufficient fishery-independent and dependent data. Using this method, we assessed local vulnerability of the Galapagos grouper ('bacalao';Mycteroperca olfax) and compared it with other phylogenetically-related species caught in the Galapagos' handline-fishery. Bacalao is an overfished regionally endemic fish species, characterized by low resilience, high market and cultural value and high spatial overlap with the fishery. Our results suggested that bacalao is a species of high management priority, requiring urgent measures to prevent fisheries' collapse. In addition, if current fishing pressure persists, other related species may become threatened in the near future. We also evaluated different management scenarios using this approach. Results suggested that the inclusion of additional no-take zones in the marine reserve, comprising key nursery habitats (such as mangroves) and spawning aggregation sites, would be necessary to reduce species vulnerability and to benefit other related species.

In an output-regulated fishery, this policy might also limit the effort levels as all the catches count against the quota. In both cases, this regulation can reduce the economic performance of the companies, even in single-species fisheries. A possible solution is to increase the mesh size, thus retaining fewer small individuals. To study this option, a bioeconomic simulation of a change in the gear selectivity from 100- to 120-mm minimum mesh size (MMS) was performed. The results show that the private perspective (profits) does not change. Furthermore, due to the lower retention of 120 mm MMS, the efficiency of a fishing day was reduced by 5% and 2.5%, from the point of view of capital and labour productivity, respectively.

Complex ecosystem models are often used to evaluate potential ecosystem consequences of forage fish fisheries, but there is seldom sufficient data to parameterize them, and full consideration of uncertainty is impossible. Models of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystem assessment (MICE) provide a link between full ecosystem models and tactical (usually single-species) models typically used in fisheries management. MICE are ideal tools to form the basis for management strategy evaluations that compare the ability of candidate strategies to achieve goals related to target fisheries and broader ecosystem protection objectives. A MICE model is developed for the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) that focuses on the fishery for the northern subpopulation of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sajax) and the indirect impacts of the fishery on place-based predators, in particular brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis) and California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), in the Southern California Bight. The model includes three forage species (sardine, northern anchovy Engraulis mordax, and Ôother forageÕ), an Ôother preyÕ category, and two predator species (brown pelican and California sea lion) and evaluates the impacts of variable forage availability on adult predator reproductive success and survival. Parameterization of the model is based on available monitoring data and assessment outputs. The model is used to assess the ecosystem and fishery consequences of the current sardine management systems for Mexico, the USA, and Canada, with a focus on identifying which among a long list of sources of uncertainty in the system are most consequential for predictions of fishery impacts on predators. Key sources of uncertainty to consider in ecosystem assessments for the CCE are how prey abundance and availability impact predator demography and the extent to which the dynamics of prey populations are driven by environmental factors. Data are available for some of these sources of uncertainty for CCE sardine management, but much uncertainty remains, necessitating exploration of sensitivity to alternative model formulations and parameter values when providing advice on management strategies to decision makers. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,,Scopus,,West coast of North America,North America,"50,000-100,000",multidecadal,">100,000",year,Simulated dynamics,2,2,3,,,Task 6.2 - climatic and ecological effects on the impact of fisheries management_Task 6.5 - management strategies,MICE,MICE,Multi-stock (with species interactions),sardine_anchovy_other forage species_other prey species_brown pelican_sea lion,Age structured,multi-fleet/metier,coastal pelagic,No,Spatially implicit,Yes,temperature dependent recruitment,Output control ,No,Biological,catch_abundance,not clear,,"A model of intermediate complexity for ecosystem (MICE) assessment to analyze the implications of the harvest control rule for Pacific sardine in the California Current Ecosystem on coastal pelagic species and their predators.

The harvest control rules that are used to provide management advice consequently relate catches to stock biomass levels expressed relative to reference biomass levels. There are, however, additional trade-offs. Ecosystem based fisheries management (EBFM) aims to consider fish and fisheries in their ecological context, taking into account physical, biological, economic, and social factors. However, making EBFM operational remains challenging. It is generally recognized that end-to-end modeling should be a key part of implementing EBFM, along with harvest control rules that use information in addition to estimates of stock biomass to provide recommendations for management actions. Here we outline the process for selecting among alternative management strategies in an ecosystem context and summarize a Field integrated End-To-End modeling program, or FETE, intended to implement this process as part of the Bering Sea Project. A key aspect of this project was that, from the start, the FETE included a management strategy evaluation component to compare management strategies. Effective use of end-to-end modeling requires that the models developed for a system are indeed integrated across climate drivers, lower trophic levels, fish population dynamics, and fisheries and their management. We summarize the steps taken by the program managers to promote integration of modeling efforts by multiple investigators and highlight the lessons learned during the project that can be used to guide future use and design of end-to-end models.

Recently, its spatial routine Ecospace has evolved due to the addition of the Habitat Foraging Capacity Model (HFCM), a spatial-temporal dynamic niche model to drive the foraging capacity to distribute biomass over model grid cells. The HFCM allows for continuous implementation of externally derived habitat preference maps based on single species distribution models. So far, guidelines are lacking on how to best define habitat preferences for inclusion in process-oriented trophic modeling studies. As one of the first studies, we applied the newest Ecospace development to an existing EwE model of the southern North Sea with the aim to identify which definition of habitat preference leads to the best model fit. Another key aim of our study was to test for the sensitivity of implementing externally derived habitat preference maps within Ecospace to different time-scales (seasonal, yearly, multi-year, and static). For this purpose, generalized additive models (GAM) were fit to scientific survey data using either presence/absence or abundance as differing criteria of habitat preference. Our results show that Ecospace runs using habitat preference maps based on presence/absence data compared best to empirical data. The optimal time-scale for habitat updating differed for biomass and catch, but implementing variable habitats was generally superior to a static habitat representation. Our study hence highlights the importance of a sigmoidal representation of habitat (e.g. presence/absence) and variable habitat preferences (e.g. multi-year) when combining species distribution models with an ecosystem model.

Some spatial management approaches are quite blunt, as when marine protected areas (MPAs) are established to restrict fishing in specific locations. Other management tools, such as zoning or spatial user rights, will affect the distribution of fishing effort in a more nuanced manner. Considerable research has focused on the ability of MPAs to increase fishery returns, but the potential for the broader class of spatial management approaches to outperform MPAs has received far less attention. We use bioeconomic models of seven nearshore fisheries in Southern California to explore the value of optimized spatial management in which the distribution of fishing is chosen to maximize profits. We show that fully optimized spatial management can substantially increase fishery profits relative to optimal nonspatial management but that the magnitude of this increase depends on characteristics of the fishing fleet and target species. Strategically placed MPAs can also increase profits substantially compared with nonspatial management, particularly if fishing costs are low, although profit increases available through optimal MPA-based management are roughly half those from fully optimized spatial management. However, if the same total area is protected by randomly placing MPAs, starkly contrasting results emerge: most random MPA designs reduce expected profits. The high value of spatial management estimated here supports continued interest in spatially explicit fisheries regulations but emphasizes that predicted increases in profits can only be achieved if the fishery is well understood and the regulations are strategically designed.",English,Article,"Green Published, Bronze",WOS,,Southern California (nearshore),North America,">100,000",'NOT RELEVANT',"5,000-10,000",'NOT RELEVANT',Other (habitat availability from sonar and aerial surveys.

IQF regulates a limited transfer between stock specific total allowable catches (TAC), the main measure of stock conservation in CFP set in accordance with precautionary or, where possible, analytically estimated levels of maximum sustainable yield (MSY). IQF is intended to mitigate the various potential conflicts in the management of multi-species fisheries resulting from stricter catch limitations, which, in turn, are due to the newly-introduced landing obligation for all catches of TAC-regulated stocks. In this paper, the management implications of inter-species flexibility are evaluated by modelling various scenarios of individual and multiple multi-species fisheries exploiting virtual stocks of different sizes and productivity. The results reveal that IQF is rather ineffectual if sustainable stock-specific management goals are similar in terms of exploitation rate. However, if these goals are modified in response to potential ecological conservation needs or market considerations - which would reflect reality more closely - IQF may offer a frequently applicable and effective tool. Simulations carried out in this study demonstrate that IQF may support the use of quotas by increasing fishing opportunities of by-catch species, which are then subtracted from the target stock allowances. However, multiple and jointly managed multi-species fisheries frequently appear limited due to reduced fishing opportunities of target stocks, which may prevent the progressive application of IQF. As such, IQF is helpful for certain specific fisheries management, rather than as a tool for broader management approaches jointly applied to different fishing strategies. It is concluded that the application of IQF may undermine the politically-agreed and fixed quota-sharing rule among European member states (i.e. the relative stability) and also lacks a reference to F-MSY; i.e., it remains to be clarified whether the application of IQF would result in tolerable levels of short term overfishing of by-catch stocks with regard to MSY.",English,Article,,WOS,,virtual,Not relevant,'NOT RELEVANT',multidecadal,'NOT RELEVANT',year,Simulated dynamics,'NOT RELEVANT',2,'NOT RELEVANT',,,Task 6.5,Other (stochastic medium term prediction of stock and Þshery parameters),Other (stochastic medium term prediction of stock and Þshery parameters),Multi-stock (with species interactions),2 virtual stocks,Age structured,multi-fleet/metier,virtual fisheries,No,No spatial context,No,,Output control ,No,Biological,SSB/Blim_F/Ftarget,not clear,,"In this study, a modelling framework for management strategy evaluations was applied to test the performance of inter-species quota ßexibility (IQF) in multiple-species

It is shown that for overfished stocks, an MPA may yield resource protection, maximize harvests and increase consumer and producer surplus, as well as give higher employment. This, however, is less apparent for moderately overfished as well as highly migratory stocks. Resource protection and enhancement implicitly improves ecosystem services. (C) 2014 The Authors.

We developed an ensemble modeling framework to evaluate the relative importance of different uncertainty sources for food web projections of the eastern Bering Sea (EBS). Specifically, dynamically downscaled projections from Earth System Models (ESM) under different greenhouse gas emission scenarios (GHG) were used to force a multispecies size spectrum model (MSSM) of the EBS food web. In addition to ESM and GHG uncertainty, we incorporated uncertainty from different plausible fisheries management scenarios reflecting shifts in the total allowable catch of flatfish and gadids and different assumptions regarding temperature-dependencies on biological rates in the MSSM. Relative to historical averages (1994-2014), end-of-century (2080-2100 average) ensemble projections of community spawner stock biomass, catches, and mean body size (+/- standard deviation) decreased by 36% (+/- 21%), 61% (+/- 27%), and 38% (+/- 25%), respectively. Long-term trends were, on average, also negative for the majority of species, but the level of trend consistency between ensemble projections was low for most species. Projection uncertainty for model outputs from -2020 to 2040 was driven by inter-annual climate variability for 85% of species and the community as a whole. Thereafter, structural uncertainty (different ESMs, temperature-dependency assumptions) dominated projection uncertainty. Fishery management and GHG emissions scenarios contributed little (<10%) to projection uncertainty, with the exception of catches for a subset of flatfishes which were dominated by fishery management scenarios. Long-term outcomes were improved in most cases under a moderate mitigation relative to a high business-as-usual GHG emissions scenario and we show how inclusion of temperature-dependencies on processes related to body growth and intrinsic (non-predation) natural mortality can strongly influence projections in potentially non-additive ways. Narrowing the spread of long-term projections in future ensemble simulations will depend primarily on whether the set of ESMs and food web models considered behave more or less similarly to one another relative to the present models sets.

We examined how qualitative network models (QNMs) can be deployed to support decision making when data, time, and funding limitations restrict use of more demanding quantitative methods. We used QNMs to evaluate management interventions intended to promote the rebuilding of a collapsed stock of blue king crab (Paralithodes platypus) (BKC) around the Pribilof Islands (eastern Bering Sea) to determine how their potential efficacy may change under climate change. Based on stakeholder input and a literature review, we constructed a QNM that described the life cycle of BKC, key ecological interactions, potential climate-change impacts, relative interaction strengths, and uncertainty in terms of interaction strengths and link presence. We performed sensitivity analyses to identify key sources of prediction uncertainty. Under a scenario of no climate change, predicted increases in BKC were reliable only when stock enhancement was implemented in a BKC hatchery-program scenario. However, when climate change was accounted for, the intervention could not counteract its adverse impacts, which had an overall negative effect on BKC. The remaining management scenarios related to changes in fishing effort on BKC predators. For those scenarios, BKC outcomes were unreliable, but climate change further decreased the probability of observing recovery. Including information on relative interaction strengths increased the likelihood of predicting positive outcomes for BKC approximately 5-50% under the management scenarios. The largest gains in prediction precision will be made by reducing uncertainty associated with ecological interactions between adult BKC and red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus).

We apply the framework to parametric uncertainty in the traditional Gordon-Schaefer model of a fishery to illustrate how performance can be sacrificed (traded-off) for reduced sensitivity and hence increased robustness, with respect to model parameter uncertainty. With sufficient data, our robustness-vulnerability analysis provides tools to discuss policy options. When less data are available, it can be used to inform the early stages of a learning process. Several key insights emerge from this analysis: (1) the classic optimal control policy can be very sensitive to parametric uncertainty, (2) even mild robustness properties are difficult to achieve for the simple Gordon-Schaefer model, and (3) achieving increased robustness with respect to some parameters (e.g., biological parameters) necessarily results in increased sensitivity (decreased robustness) with respect to other parameters (e.g., economic parameters). We thus illustrate fundamental robustness-vulnerability trade-offs and the limits to robust natural resource management. Finally, we use the framework to explore the effects of infrequent sampling and delays on policy performance. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",English,Article,,Scopus,,Generic,Not relevant,'NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT',Other (multiple sources),'NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT',3,,,Task 6.5 - management strategies,Other (Gordon-Schaefer bioeconomic model),Other (Gordon-Schaefer bioeconomic model),Single stock,Generic (partly based on southern horse mackerel),Biomass aggregated,single-fleet /metier,Generic,Yes,No spatial context,No,,Input  control,No,not specified,Sensitivity_Performance,no,,"This paper has presented a framework for quantifying robustness-performance trade-offs associated with parameter uncertainty.

The lack of data concerning the level of theta(j) creates an uncertain context for decision maker to establish duration of moratorium or the need of extending it over time. With the use of a dynamic bioeconomic model on a high value species under moratorium, we calculate how a stock recovery timeline is affected by different states of the nature of possible levels of illegal fishing (theta(j)). This study also calculates the foregone net present value of resource rent when having to extend the moratoria because of existing possible levels of illegal fishing (states of nature theta(j)). Decision matrices without probabilities of occurrence of theta(j) were developed to support decision making concerning recovery timelines.

In this study, we evaluated the sensitivity of an Ecospace model developed for the North Sea ecosystem to some of its key parameters, and we examined this model's capability to reproduce trends in spatial time-series of fish biomass and fishing effort. We measured the fit between the spatiotemporal model predictions and the corresponding data of biomass for 12 species and effort for three fishing fleets. Our results suggest that the Ecospace model for the North Sea can predict quite successfully the species distribution, but not the distribution of fishing effort. We hypothesise that the reason might be that Ecospace assumes spatial effort distribution to be driven mainly by profit, while other factors might be more important in our system at the spatiotemporal scale explored. The model might thus fail to capture fisher's behaviour accurately for this system. Despite the limitations of our ad hoc approach for sensitivity analysis, these results hint that some problems exist in our model, which might extend to other Ecospace models and perhaps to the framework in general. This study highlights the importance of validating Ecospace models with data if their results are used for management advice. We suggest that, in order to make of Ecospace a more robust tool for management advice, some critical improvements are needed: the development of an algorithm for parameter optimisation through fitting the model predictions to data, and advancement of the effort distribution model. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,,Scopus,,North Sea,Europe,">100,000",multidecadal,"50,000-100,000",year,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey_Fisheries Dependent Data,2,2,3,,,Task 6.3 - social and economic effects on the impact of fisheries management,ECOSPACE,ECOSPACE,Ecosystem model,functional groups,Biomass aggregated,multi-fleet/metier,beam/pelagic/otter trawl,Yes,Spatially explicit,No,,Input  control,No,not specified,none,not clear,,"An ecosystem-based model to analyze the North Sea ecosystem.

While integrating economics into catch advice has been identified as key in developing more effective management, few studies investigate how bioeconomic modelling can inform decision-making. At the same time, increasing evidence has been gathered on the occurrence of regime shifts in marine ecosystems, raising greater concerns regarding fish stocks' recovery ability. Policy evaluation methods, however, still resort to compensation population models. As a result, these may overestimate reproductive success, thus jeopardizing the design and evaluation of stock rebuilding policies. This paper addresses those challenges proposing a methodology that approximates a harvest control rule using an age-structured bioeconomic model. As a result, we deliver a policy rule that complies with current advice procedures and endogenously captures economics. Also, we consider concerns on the existence of regime shifts in marine populations and estimate a bioeconomic model with critical depensation. Results from our case study suggest that policies neglecting the existence of critical depensation may compromise stock rebuilding objectives and might even result in fishery collapses.

However, a thorough comparison of derived yield streams between empirical MPs and stock assessment models has not been explored. We first evaluate trade-offs in conservation and yield metrics for data-limited approaches through management strategy evaluation (MSE) of seven data-rich reef fish species in the Gulf of Mexico. We then apply data-limited approaches for each species and compare how catch advice differs from current age-based assessment models. MSEs identified empirical MPs (e.g., using relative abundance) as a compromise between data requirements and the ability to consistently achieve management objectives (e.g., prevent overfishing).

We analyzed seven marine food web models to evaluate the performance of candidate indicators of ecosystem structure and function. The basic approach involved simulating fishing perturbations to each model, measuring the response of ecosystem attributes and candidate indicators to the perturbations, and testing the ability of the indicators to track changes in the values of the attributes. We focused on 22 ecosystem attributes, encompassing structural and functional properties that are relevant to a number of stakeholder groups but are typically difficult to measure directly (for example, food web structure, energy recycling). We tested for correlations between the attributes and 27 empirically tractable candidate indicators (for example, foraging guild biomasses, ratios of community-level groups) within each of the models and quantified consistency in indicator performance across the models. Our analysis suggests that no single indicator is sufficient to describe all of the ecosystem attributes, but at the same time highlights broad, catch-all indicators (for example, detritivores, jellyfish) and distinguishes the strongest attribute-indicator relationships. Ecosystem indicators consisting of lower-trophic level, higher-productivity functional groups tended to perform particularly well. We also identified indicators that showed strong or weak associations with different attributes, but together captured changes in nearly all of them. Examples of such complementary indicators include phytoplankton, zooplanktivorous fish, piscivorous fish, and trophic level of the catch.

Two models of biological interaction are considered. Model A assumes that high levels of FAD fishing effort will not reduce the biological productivity of the underlying fish stock. In Model B, this assumption is relaxed. Results of both models suggest that if harvesting effort in the FAD fishery is unregulated, installation of FAD networks will not generally increase fishermen's aggregate profit position.

Moreover, catch rates used as a proxy of stock abundance in stock assessment, are believed to decline much more slowly than the actual stock abundance. Thus, a quota-based system may not be sufficient to sustain the stock. A bio-economic simulation and optimisation model was used to explore how various area closures in combination with the quota-system affect levels of by-catch, net profit of individual fleet segments from different ports, and stock development in that fishery. Tested area closures differed in duration, size and location relative to major ports and to seasonal movement patterns of species. These closures were tested under variable recruitment. Area closures that were covering the seasonal migration route of saithe revealed almost two times greater increases in spawning stock biomass than closures that were not covering the migration route. Even area closures where a high dispersal rate of individuals was assumed resulted in increased spawning stock biomass of saithe. Benefits of the tested area closures were distributed heterogeneously among individual fleet segments. Increases of saithe stock size were offset by increases in cod by-catch.

Moreover, catch rates used as a proxy of stock abundance in stock assessment, are believed to decline much more slowly than the actual stock abundance. Thus, a quota-based system may not be sufficient to sustain the stock. A bio-economic simulation and optimisation model was used to explore how various area closures in combination with the quota-system affect levels of by-catch, net profit of individual fleet segments from different ports, and stock development in that fishery. Tested area closures differed in duration, size and location relative to major ports and to seasonal movement patterns of species. These closures were tested under variable recruitment. Area closures that were covering the seasonal migration route of saithe revealed almost two times greater increases in spawning stock biomass than closures that were not covering the migration route. Even area closures where a high dispersal rate of individuals was assumed resulted in increased spawning stock biomass of saithe. Benefits of the tested area closures were distributed heterogeneously among individual fleet segments. Increases of saithe stock size were offset by increases in cod by-catch.

In this area, this resource is mainly exploited with rapido trawl and set nets. The stock is not yet depleted and faces a situation of growth overfishing. The comparison between the spatial distribution by age of S. solea and the geographic patterns of the rapido trawl fishing effort evidenced an overlapping of this fishing activity with the area where juveniles concentrate (age groups 0-2). The majority of spawners inhabits specific offshore areas, here defined as 'sole sanctuaries', where high concentrations of debris and benthic communities make difficult trawling with rapido.The aim of this study was to evaluate existing spatial management regimes and potential new spatial and temporal closures in the northern and central Adriatic Sea using a simple modelling tool. Two spatial simulations were carried out in order to verify the effectiveness of complementary methods for the management of fisheries: the ban of rapido trawling from October to December within 6. nautical miles and 9. nautical miles of the Italian coast. The focus of the simulation is that the effort of the rapido trawl is moved far from the coast during key sole recruitment periods, when the juveniles are moving from the inshore nursery area toward the offshore feeding grounds. The management scenarios showed that a change in selectivity would lead to a clear increase in the spawning stock biomass and an increase in landings of S. solea in the medium-term. The rapido trawl activity could be managed by using a different logic, bearing in mind that catches and incomes would increase with small changes in the spatial pattern of the fishing effort.The present study highlights the importance of taking into account spatial dimensions of fishing fleets and the possible interactions that can occur between fleets and target species, facilitating the development of control measures to achieve a healthy balance between stock exploitation and socio-economic factors. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,No,Scopus,,northern and central Adriatic Sea,Europe,">100,000",decade,'NOT RELEVANT',year,Multiple methods,'NOT RELEVANT',2,2,A change in selectivity induced by temporal closure of the coast would lead to an increase in the spawning stock biomass and in landings,Selectivities estimated from spacialised monthly catches at age,Task 6.5 - management strategies,Other (Age-structured single stock model),Other (Age-structured single stock model),Single stock,Common sole,Age structured,multi-fleet/metier,Rapido trawl_Set nets,No,Spatially implicit,No,,Spatial management ,No,Biological,Biomass_Landings,yes,"NOAA

This study presents a modelling framework for management strategy evaluations which takes into account the response of fishers to management schemes. Based on the upcoming discard ban, two discard prevention strategies were tested for the North Sea saithe fishery, where fleet segments have either no or a generally low quota for cod. Costs and benefits were assessed under the current management, a non-flexible system, where fleet segments had to stop fishing once the cod quota was reached and a flexible system where quota of saithe could be used to cover over-quota catch of cod at a ratio 1:5. The flexible scenario was beneficial both in protecting the North Sea saithe and cod stock and in increasing net profits of fleet segments in the long term. The avoidance behaviour of fleet segments to over-quota catch led to a high SSB level of saithe and cod in the long term, ensuring high long-term catches and profits.

These considerations are important for forage fish fisheries, because these species provide ecosystem services as a key prey in food webs and support valuable commercial fisheries. Forage fish stocks fluctuate naturally, and fishing may make these fluctuations more pronounced, yet harvest strategies intended to ameliorate these effects might adversely affect fisheries and communities. Here, we evaluate trade-offs among a diverse suite of management objectives by simulating outcomes from several harvest strategies on forage fish species. We demonstrate that some trade-offs (like those between catches and minimizing collapse length) were universal among forage species and could not be eliminated by the use of different control rules. We also demonstrate that trade-offs vary among forage fish species, with strong trade-offs between stable, high catches and high-biomass periods (bonanzas) for menhaden- and anchovy-like fish, and counterintuitive trade-offs for sardine-like fish between shorter collapses and longer bonanzas. We find that harvest strategies designed to maintain stability in catches will result in more severe collapses. Finally, we show that the ability of assessments to detect rapid changes in population status greatly affects control rule performance and the degree and type of trade-offs, increasing the risk and severity of collapses and reducing catches. Together, these results demonstrate that while default harvest strategies are useful in data-poor situations, management strategy evaluations that are tailored to specific forage fish may better balance trade-offs.",English,Article,,WOS,,general model; not region-specific,Not relevant,'NOT RELEVANT',multidecadal,'NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT',Simulated dynamics,'NOT RELEVANT',2,3,"This analysis highlights the possibility that some trade-offs will consistently emerge among diverse forage fish and fishery types, and resources may be better invested in adapting to these accepted trade-offs than in devising more complex control rules.",,Task 6.2 - climatic and ecological effects on the impact of fisheries management,Other (no name given),Other (no name given),Multi-stock (with species interactions),anchovy_menhaden_sardin ,Age structured,Fleet not considered,,No,No spatial context,No,,Input  control,Not clear,Biological,catch_biomass_catch stability,yes,R,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_1235,Melia,"Siple, MC; Koehn, LE; Johnson, KF; Punt, AE; Canales, TM; Carpi, P; de Moor, CL; De Oliveira, JAA; Gao, J; Jacobsen, NS; Lam, ME; Licandeo, R; Lindegren, M; Ma, SY; Oskarsson, GJ; Sanchez-Marono, S; Smolinski, S; Surma, S; Tian, YJ; Tommasi, D; Gutierrez, TM; Trenkel, V; Zador, SG; Zimmermann, F",Considerations for management strategy evaluation for small pelagic fishes,2021,FISH AND FISHERIES,22,6,1167,1186,10.1111/faf.12579,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/faf.12579,"Management strategy evaluation (MSE) is the state-of-the-art approach for testing and comparing management strategies in a way that accounts for multiple sources of uncertainty (e.g. monitoring, estimation, and implementation). Management strategy evaluation can help identify management strategies that are robust to uncertainty about the life history of the target species and its relationship to other species in the food web. Small pelagic fish (e.g. anchovy, herring and sardine) fulfil an important ecological role in marine food webs and present challenges to the use of MSE and other simulation-based evaluation approaches. This is due to considerable stochastic variation in their ecology and life history, which leads to substantial observation and process uncertainty. Here, we summarize the current state of MSE for small pelagic fishes worldwide. We leverage expert input from ecologists and modellers to draw attention to sources of process and observation uncertainty for small pelagic species, providing examples from geographical regions where these species are ecologically, economically and culturally important. Temporal variation in recruitment and other life-history rates, spatial structure and movement, and species interactions are key considerations for small pelagic fishes. We discuss tools for building these into the MSE process, with examples from existing fisheries.

As part of that evaluation, adaptive policies can be compared with alternative nonadaptive management scenarios. Also, the value of reducing structural (ecological) uncertainty to achieving management objectives can be quantified. A multispecies adaptive management framework was recently adopted by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission for sustainable harvest of Delaware Bay horseshoe crabs Limulus polyphemus, while maintaining adequate stopover habitat for migrating red knots Calidris canutus rufa, the focal shorebird species. The predictive model set encompassed the structural uncertainty in the relationships between horseshoe crab spawning, red knot weight gain and red knot vital rates. Stochastic dynamic programming was used to generate a state-dependent strategy for harvest decisions given that uncertainty. In this paper, we employed a management strategy evaluation approach to evaluate the performance of this adaptive management framework. Active adaptive management was used by including model weights as state variables in the optimization and reducing structural uncertainty by model weight updating. We found that the value of information for reducing structural uncertainty is expected to be low, because the uncertainty does not appear to impede effective management. Harvest policy responded to abundance levels of both species regardless of uncertainty in the specific relationship that generated those abundances. Thus, the expected horseshoe crab harvest and red knot abundance were similar when the population generating model was uncertain or known, and harvest policy was robust to structural uncertainty as specified. Synthesis and applications.The combination of management strategy evaluation with state-dependent strategies from stochastic dynamic programming was an informative approach to evaluate adaptive management performance and value of learning. Although natural resource decisions are characterized by uncertainty, not all uncertainty will cause decisions to be altered substantially, as we found in this case.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of bio-economic models to represent and analyze the short-term dynamics of fishing effort in response to regulation in the fisheries management literature. In this literature, fishing firms are usually modeled as autonomous decision-making units determining their harvest strategies so as to maximize profit, given technical and institutional constraints. The overall dynamics of a fishery is modeled as the result of these individual choices, and of interactions between individual choices due to the impacts of harvesting on the fish stock and/or problems of congestion. Applications have, for example, been related to the discussion of closed areas as fisheries management tools. A multi-agent model of a fishery targeting different species in different areas was developed to analyze the implications of taking into account the response of fishing fleets to such regulatory controls. The model is based on the Cormas platform developed for the simulation of the dynamics of common resource systems. An advantage of the multi-agent approach is that it allows a greater degree of complexity than standard bioeconomic modeling tools, by focusing on local, rather than global, interactions. Simulation results are presented to illustrate how the model can be used to analyze the consequences of regulatory measures such as temporary fishing bans on the allocation of fishing effort between target species and areas, and the ensuing economic impacts of these measures.

Quantitative modelling tools can be used to explore how ecosystems might respond to potential management measures, but no one model can reliably forecast all aspects of future change. To build a robust basis for management advice, a suite of models can be used, but the interpretation of the joint output of multiple models can be difficult. We employ a newly developed ensemble approach to integrate 5 different ecosystem models and estimate changes in ecosystem state within a single probabilistic forecast. We provide evidence on the response of ecosystem state (measured using ecological indicators relating to plankton, fish and top predators) to potential fisheries management scenarios. We demonstrate that if future fishing mortality is consistent with maximum sustainable yield policy, the North Sea fish community will recover in terms of its size structure and species composition. However, there is currently large uncertainty in trends of future fish biomass, plankton and top predators. We conclude that (1) this ensemble approach can be applied directly to policy-relevant questions and add value for decision makers, as multiple aspects of uncertainty are considered; (2) future research should prioritise improvements in model skill via a reduction in uncertainty surrounding biomass estimates; and (3) fisheries management that leads to sustainable fishing levels can be considered appropriate for 2 crucial aspects of fish biodiversity: species composition and size structure.",English,Article,,WOS,,North Sea,Europe,">100,000",multidecadal,'NOT RELEVANT',year,'NOT RELEVANT',2,2,3,,,Task 6.2 - climatic and ecological effects on the impact of fisheries management_Task 6.4_Task 6.5,EwE_Other (mizer)_Other(FishSUMS)_StrathE2E_LeMans,EwE_mizer_FishSUMS_StrathE2E_LeMans,Ecosystem model,Functional groups,Other (biomass aggregated for most models; a few of them describing only materials flows across functional groups),multi-fleet/metier,demersal,No,Spatially implicit,No,,,No,Biological,total biomass of marine birds and mammals_total biomass of demersal fish community_LFI_typical length indicator_mean maximum length indicator,yes,EwE_mizer_FishSUMS_StrathE2E_LeMans,The authors employ an ensemble approach to integrate 5 ecosystem models and estimate changes in ecosystem state within a single probabilistic forecast.

Many of these models are based upon statistical techniques and are good at assessing the current state and making short-term predictions; however, as they do not model interactions between stocks, they lack predictive power on longer timescales. Additionally, there are size-based multi-species models that represent key biological processes and consider interactions between stocks such as predation and competition for resources. Due to the complexity of these models, they are difficult to fit to data, and so many size-based multi-species models depend upon single-species models where they exist, or ad hoc assumptions when they do not, for parameters such as annual fishing mortality. In this paper, we demonstrate that by taking a state-space approach, many of the uncertain parameters can be treated dynamically, allowing us to fit, with quantifiable uncertainty, size-based multi-species models directly to data. We demonstrate this by fitting uncertain parameters, including annual fishing mortality, of a size-based multi-species model of the Celtic Sea, for species with and without single-species stock assessments. Consequently, errors in the single-species models no longer propagate through the multi-species model and underlying assumptions are more transparent. Building size-based multi-species models that are internally consistent, with quantifiable uncertainty, will improve their credibility and utility for management. This may lead to their uptake by being either used to corroborate single-species models; directly in the advice process to make predictions into the future; or used to provide a new way of managing data-limited stocks. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",English,Article,,Scopus,Not relevant to fisheries management evaluation models,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_1262,Politikos,M.

To expose trade-offs between the fleets' objectives and to explore what a possible variant of a multispecies maximum sustainable yield (MSY) could look like, we parameterized an ecosystem model and subjected it to a range of different fishing effort levels of the three fleets. Long-term projections highlighted multiple fishing regimes that lead to catches of at least 30% of all focal stocks' single species MSYs at the same time. Trade-offs between the yields of shrimp fishers and demersal trawlers made higher simultaneous yields impossible. Besides optimizing multispecies catches, we identified effort regimes that satisfied a set of descriptors of good environmental status (GES). We found that GES can only be obtained through low efforts of beam and demersal trawlers, which cannot be aligned with our multispecies MSY variant without accepting trade-offs in fishing yields and/or conservation goals. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,,Scopus,,North Sea,Europe,'NOT RELEVANT',multidecadal,'NOT RELEVANT',NOT RELEVANT',Simulated dynamics,'NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT',1,,,Task 6.4 - targets and limits for indicators in an ecosystem context ,EwE,EwE,Ecosystem model,Sole_Plaice_Cod_Crangon,Biomass aggregated,multi-fleet/metier,trawler_demersal purser and seiner,No,No spatial context,Yes,not clear,Output control ,No,Biological,MSY,yes,Ewe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_1264,Sys,"Stafford, R","A computational approach to ecological and economic sustainable harvest management strategies in a multi-species context, with implications for cod recovery plans",2008,ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS,3,1,105,110,10.1016/j.ecoinf.2007.12.001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2007.12.001,"Multi-species models consider interactions, particularly predation, between and within species.

First, it is shown that if the harvest of one species has impact on the price of another species, then this has a positive effect on its steady-state stock. The effect increases with the stock-elasticity in the cost function. Further, in the case of linear demand functions, the steady state outcome depends solely on the sum of the cross-price parameters and not their individual values. Secondly, in the investigation of optimal paths, it is shown that if the harvest of one species has impact on the price of the other, optimal trajectories reach steady state faster for itself and slower for the other species.

Uncertainties in annual stock size and run timing, fleet dynamics, and both preseason and in-season forecasts were accounted for explicitly in this simulation. The simulation model was applied to evaluating four kinds of management strategies with different fishing opening schedules and decision rules. The ranking of the management strategies is apparently determined by the evaluation criteria applied. When only flesh quality is concerned, both the current and a more aggressive strategy, as long as they adapted themselves to the run strength, were able to provide higher quality fish without compromising the escapement objectives. When the value of the eggs is also a concern, the management strategies that have more intensive late opening schedules might be preferable.

The analysis is based on a bio-economic model which is examined as a dynamic control system in continuous time. A target point is obtained that maximizes yield while minimizing the impact of fishing on population biomass and that reduces the risk. A new approach using neural network is developed as a tool to produce a formula for forecasting fish stock recruitment.

Based on previous research, a set of improved mass-balanced models was constructed in Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) to represent ecosystem states existing circa 1900, 1950, and currently. These models feature increased taxonomic and ecological resolution relative to their predecessors across trophic levels and size classes from zooplankton to whales. A more detailed representation of Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), including its age structure, predators, and prey, was introduced to permit modeling of the ecosystem role of herring as a forage fish, as well as the ecological impacts of herring fisheries. Gross ecosystem structure and herring trophodynamics were compared across ecosystem states using size spectra and ecological indicators, including mixed trophic impacts (MTIs). The 1950 model was fitted to a comprehensive set of biomass and catch time series. Dynamic ecosystem simulations evaluated the influence of fishing, predation, other natural mortality, and primary productivity trends on ecosystem behavior since 1950, as well as the relative importance of top-down versus bottom-up forcing. Size spectra and ecosystem indicators suggest that the Haida Gwaii ecosystem has not undergone a radical structural shift since 1900, despite heavy exploitation of numerous marine mammals and fish. Moreover, MTIs show that herring constitutes an important mid-trophic level node in the food web, participating in complex interactions with many predators, prey, and competitors. Dynamic ecosystem simulations demonstrate that trends in fishing mortality, trophic interactions, and primary productivity (correlated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) are all necessary to explain historical Haida Gwaii ecosystem behavior. These interacting drivers yield a mosaic of top-down and bottom-up trophic control for trophic interactions involving herring and throughout the food web. Simulation results also suggest that production of several herring, salmon, and groundfish stocks may have recently become partially decoupled from primary productivity, perhaps due to changes in copepod guild composition. These results also indicate that a biodiversity decline and ?fishing down the food web? occurred off Haida Gwaii since 1950.

This paper aimed to determine whether Pacific herring serves as a key forage fish (i.e. strongly supports predator populations) in the southeastern Gulf of Alaska. All analyses were conducted using mass- and energy-balanced ecosystem models constructed in Ecopath with Ecosim. Supportive Role to Fishery (SURF) index values were computed using predator diets and food web structure encoded in static ecosystem models. Ecosystem impacts of herring stock depletion and collapse were evaluated using quantitative criteria (thresholds) applied to dynamic ecosystem simulations. SURF index values from mass-balanced models lay below the threshold required to designate herring as a key forage fish. However, values from an energy-balanced model supported the key status of herring. Dynamic ecosystem simulations in mass- and energy-balanced models revealed strong negative effects of herring depletion on several predators. In most energy-balanced models, simulation results designated herring as a key forage fish despite indications of functional redundancy in the forage fish guild. Impacts of herring depletion on predators were stronger and more numerous in energybalanced models, suggesting that the high energy content of herring enhances its importance to predators. Simulation results also demonstrated positive impacts of herring depletion on two zooplankton groups due to release from predation pressure. The status of Pacific herring as a key forage fish apparently depends on its energy content relative to other forage fish.

Firstly, Pacific herring may function as a key forage fish in the southeastern Gulf of Alaska when its energy content is high relative to those of other forage fish. Secondly, herring biomass supports numerous predators, including piscivorous fish, marine mammals, and seabirds. Thirdly, bottom-up impacts of herring availability on these predators may be partly damped by functional redundancy within the forage fish guild. Fourthly, however, these bottom-up effects of herring on many predators are likely intensified by the high energy content of herring relative to other prey in the Gulf of Alaska.

We used an Ecopath with Ecosim ecosystem model parameterized for northern British Columbia (Canada), employing Ecosim to simulate ecosystem effects of herring stock collapse. The ecological impacts of various herring fishing strategies were investigated with a Management Strategy Evaluation algorithm within Ecosim, accounting for variability in climatic drivers and stock assessment errors. Ecosim results suggest that herring stock collapse would have cascading impacts on much of the pelagic food web. Management Strategy Evaluation results indicate that herring and their predators suffer moderate impacts from the existing British Columbia harvest control rule, although more precautionary management strategies could substantially reduce these impacts. The non-capture spawn-on-kelp fishery, traditionally practiced by many British Columbia and Alaska indigenous peoples, apparently has extremely limited ecological impacts. Our simulations also suggest that adopting a maximum sustainable yield management strategy in Northeast Pacific herring fisheries could generate strong, cascading food web effects. Furthermore, climate shifts, especially when combined with herring stock assessment errors, could strongly reduce the biomasses and resilience of herring and its predators.

Our results showed that the Portuguese continental shelf ecosystem model is a good predictor of biomass and catch time-series trends for many species. Moreover, our results suggested that the main factors that drove the ecosystem dynamics were trophic interactions, fishing and environmental forcing (sea surface temperature). The same drivers were important in explaining sardine decline among which the largest contribution was observed when incorporating sea surface temperature forcing on adult sardine, followed by fishing. Moreover, sardine eggs predators (i.e., chub mackerel, horse mackerel and bogue) were emphasised as the most important among trophic interactions in explaining sardine trend between 1986 and 2017. Furthermore, a flow control hypothesis test, showed that model parametrization allows explaining sardine behaviour through wasp-waist control mechanism, characteristic for upwelling systems.

Turnbull,Can spawning closures allow more fishing capacity in the torres strait prawn fishery?: A simulation study,2009,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086252464&partnerID=40&md5=a3f9b19575803aa4e8ddf25c0b918ff4,"The Torres Strait Prawn fishery is a multi-species fishery harvesting in the order of 1300t of brown tiger prawns (Penaeus esculentus) and blue endeavour prawns (Metapenaeus endeavouri) annually. The fishery is primarily controlled by total allowable effort. This was recently reduced from 13570 vessel nights to 9200, 75% of which is allocated to Australian vessels (6867 nights). With recent economic downturns the size of the active fleet has dropped from 74 to 37 vessels and the observed fishing effort from ~10000 to ~4000 nights. Industry has raised an urgent need for new spatial management to allow more fishing capacity without compromising biological as well as economical sustainability of the fishery. A multi-species monthly spatially explicit simulation model (TSPFsim) was developed in order to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of an alternate management strategy: a closure designed to protect spawning tiger prawns. This would close fishing in the deeper eastern sector of the trawl ground when effort reaches a trigger level of nights fished. The model divided the stock into multiple spatial regions and tracked the regional population dynamics by applying growth, mortality, recruitment and movement among these regions. Movement was implemented using a spatial transition matrix. The transition probabilities were estimated from tag-recapture data. Temporal and spatial levels of fishing effort were simulated based on a weighted combination of the historical fishing pattern and attractiveness ($ value per unit of effort) of fishing in each region. A number of key uncertainties were considered including: temporal and spatial variations in recruitment and fishing pattern (process error); and less-than-certain likelihood that fishers use up their allocated nights. The latter, known as implementation error, was related to simple economic indicators of fuel cost and prawn market prices. The performance of the management scenarios was evaluated in terms of the risk that biomass is reduced below the level that can support MSY (i.e. BMSY). Results showed that the tiger spawner closure would have a minimal impact on reducing this risk. Possible reasons for this are: 1) the proportion of spawners protected by this closure was relatively small; 2) the additional effort re-allocated into other regions after the closure was introduced countered the number of spawners protected in closed region; and 3) the effort trigger points were only activated in the latter part of the fishing season when the fishing pressure was relatively low. The results also showed that the effort trigger points were unlikely to be activated unless 100% usage of total allocated effort was assumed (no implementation error; fishers use up all their nights). Fishers do not currently fully utilize all their allocated nights due to the current general market conditions of low prawn prices and high fuel costs. Unless this situation changes, the triggers will unlikely be activated. The results inform the long-term harvest strategy for the prawn fishery by providing stakeholders with estimates of the risk of the stock biomass falling below sustainable level for a range of fishing effort. © MODSIM 2009.All rights reserved.",English,Conference Paper,,Scopus,,Torres Strait Protected Zone (TSPZ) between Australia and Papua New Guinea (PNG),Australia,">100,000",multidecadal,'NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT',Fisheries Dependent Data,2,2,3,"We conclude that the proposed tiger spawner closure would have a minimum benefit for the fishery in terms of reducing the risk of overfishing the tiger prawn stock and maximising the productivity of the fishery.

Deep-water habitats are limited by primary productivity and are mainly dependent on the vertical input of organic matter from the surface. Global change over the latest decades is imparting variations in primary productivity levels across oceans, and thus it has an impact on the amount of organic matter landing on the deep seafloor. In addition, anthropogenic impacts are now reaching the deep ocean. The Mediterranean Sea, the largest enclosed basin on the planet, is not an exception. However, ecosystem-level studies of response to varying food input and anthropogenic stressors on deep-sea ecosystems are still scant. We present here a comparative ecological network analysis of three food webs of the deep Mediterranean Sea, with contrasting trophic structure. After modelling the flows of these food webs with the Ecopath with Ecosim approach, we compared indicators of network structure and functioning. We then developed temporal dynamic simulations varying the organic matter input to evaluate its potential effect. Results show that, following the west-to-east gradient in the Mediterranean Sea of marine snow input, organic matter recycling increases, net production decreases to negative values and trophic organisation is overall reduced. The levels of food-web activity followed the gradient of organic matter availability at the seafloor, confirming that deep-water ecosystems directly depend on marine snow and are therefore influenced by variations of energy input, such as climate-driven changes. In addition, simulations of varying marine snow arrival at the seafloor, combined with the hypothesis of a possible fishery expansion on the lower continental slope in the western basin, evidence that the trawling fishery may pose an impact which could be an order of magnitude stronger than a climate-driven reduction of marine snow.

Here, we develop, and apply to North Sea fisheries, a method for collectively assessing the effects of, and interplay between, technical interactions, multispecies interactions, and the environmental effects of fishing. Ecological interactions involving 21 species are characterized with an ensemble of 188 plausible parameterizations of size-based multispecies models, and four fleets (beam trawl, otter trawl, industrial, and pelagic) characterized with catch composition data. We use the method to evaluate biomass and economic yields, alongside the risk of stock depletion and changes in the value of community indicators, for 10 000 alternate fishing scenarios (combinations of rates of fishing mortality F and fleet configuration) and present the risk vs. reward trade-offs. Technical and multispecies interactions linked to the beam and otter trawl fleets were predicted to have the strongest effects on fisheries yield and value, risk of stock collapse and fish community indicators. Increasing beam trawl effort led to greater increases in beam trawl yield when otter trawl effort was low. If otter trawl effort was high, increases in beam trawl effort led to reduced overall yield. Given the high value of demersal species, permutations of fleet effort leading to high total yield (generated primarily by pelagic species) were not the same as permutations leading to high catch values. A transition from F for 1990 to 2010 to FMSY, but without changes in fleet configuration, reduced risk of stock collapse without affecting long-term weight or value of yield.

Maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and FMSY for 21 modelled speciesÕ populations in the North Sea were defined at the Nash equilibrium, where any independent change in F for any species would not increase that speciesÕ MSY. Fishing mortality ranges leading to ÒPretty Good YieldÓ (F-PGY), by species, were defined as ranges yielding 0.95 MSY.

Autocorrelated recruitment will occur whenever average recruitment levels change between oceanographic regimes or due to predator release, but may also indicate persistent environmental and biological effects on shorter time-scales. Here, we use estimates of recruitment variability and autocorrelation to simulate the stationary distribution of spawning biomass for 100 real-world stocks when unfished, fished at FMSY, or fished following a harvest control rule where fishing mortality decreases as a function of spawning biomass. Results show that unfished stocks have spawning biomass (SB) below its deterministic equilibrium value (SB0) 58% of the time, and below 0.5SB0 5% of the time on average across all stocks. Similarly, stocks fished at the level producing deterministic maximum sustainable yield (FMSY) are below its deterministic prediction of spawning biomass (SBMSY) 60% of the time and below 0.5SBMSY 8% of the time. These probabilities are greater for stocks with high recruitment variability, positive autocorrelation, and high natural mortality-traits that are particularly associated with clupeids and scombrids. An elevated probability of stochastic depletion, i.e. biomass below the deterministic equilibrium expectation, implies that management actions required when biomass drops below a threshold may be triggered more frequently than expected. Therefore, we conclude by suggesting that fisheries scientists routinely calculate these probabilities during stock assessments as a decision support tool for fisheries managers. © 2014 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2014.

The model design combines elements of age-structured population and harvest yield models with economics of the silver hake fishery. The analysis evaluates both biological and economic effects of interest to managers, such as future yields or rebuilding of parental stock, as well as future revenues and net returns to vessels. The bioeconomic model is used to evaluate the economic implications of tradeoffs between alternative selection patterns in the U.S. Atlantic silver hake fishery. Throughout the study, a selection pattern is defined as the suite of age-specific selection coefficients that are applied to a fish population over time. The results indicate that shifting fishing pressure to younger age classes could result in short-run gains in economic value that may not be sustainable due to longer run declines in biomass, hence lowered fishery yield and value. By contrast, strategies to delay age at first capture may improve economic value over current levels with only modest reductions in short-run fishery yield. © 1998 Marine Resources Foundation.",English,Article,,Scopus,,Area between Nova Scotia and New York Bight,North America,"50,000-100,000",decade,NOT RELEVANT',quarter,Fisheries Dependent Data,2,2,2,,"Bioeconomic model based on a Leslie matrix, with F values detremining  catches per day fished, leading to yields, and prices that are dependent on market dynamics.

The abundance of many fish stocks has declined because too much fishing capacity has been utilised on healthy fish stocks. Today, this decline in fish stocks has led to overcapacity in many fisheries, leading to incentives for overfishing. Recent research has shown that the allocation of effort among fleets can play an important role in mitigating overfishing when the targeting covers a range of species (multi-species i.e., so-called mixed fisheries), while simultaneously optimising the overall economic performance of the fleets. The so-called FcubEcon model, in particular, has elucidated both the biologically and economically optimal method for allocating catches and thus effort between fishing fleets, while ensuring that the quotas are not exceeded. Until now, the FcubEcon modelling approach has assumed that there is a simplified linear relationship between effort and fishing mortality. The present study introduces an extension of the FcubEcon model, the so-called SOMER model, that allows this relationship to be non-linear by linking the biological catch equation with the economic production function. Furthermore, the SOMER model relaxes the assumption of the joint production of fishing metiers, unique and separately defined sub-fleets, to allow for more detail regarding the flexibility to target specific groups of species. Thereby, the SOMER model enables the managers to assess the alternative management scenarios more accurately than the existing models. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

It is shown that climate change may have severe biological and economic consequences under the current cod management plan and that the negative effects on the economic performance of the fishermen as well as on the abundance of cod can be mitigated by reducing the target fishing mortality rate of cod.

Here, we develop an end-to-end model by coupling existing models that describe the dynamics of low (ROMS-N(2)P(2)Z(2)D(2)) and high trophic levels(OSMOSE). ROMS-N(2)P(2)Z(2)D(2) is a biogeochemical model representing phytoplankton and zooplankton seasonal dynamics forced by hydrodynamics in the Benguela upwelling ecosystem. OSMOSE is an individual-based model representing the dynamics of several species of fish, linked through opportunistic and size-based trophic interactions. The models are coupled through a two-way size-based predation process. Plankton provides prey for fish, and the effects of predation by fish on the plankton are described by a plankton mortality term that is variable in space and time. Using the end-to-end model, we compare the effects of two-way coupling versus one-way forcing of the fish model with the plankton biomass field. The fish-induced mortality on plankton is temporally variable, in part explained by seasonal changes in fish biomass. Inclusion of two-way feedback affects the seasonal dynamics of plankton groups and usually reduces the amplitude of variation in abundance (top-down effect). Forcing and coupling lead to different predicted food web structures owing to changes in the dominant food chain which is supported by plankton (bottom-up effect). Our comparisons of one-way forcing and two-way coupling show how feedbacks may affect abundance, food web structure and food web function and emphasise the need to critically examine the consequences of different model architectures when seeking to predict the effects of fishing and climate change.

However, MSY and its associated fishing mortality rate F-MSY are sensitive to both stock characteristics and environment conditions. In parallel, climate change impacts are increasingly affecting fish stocks directly and indirectly but might also change the exploitation reference points and the associated level of catch. Here we explored the variability of MSY reference points under climate change by using a multi-species model applied to the Eastern English Channel, a highly exploited semi-continental sea. The spatial individual-based OSMOSE explicitly represents the entire fish life cycle of 14 species interacting through size-based opportunistic predation. The model was first parameterized and run to fit the historical situation (2000-2009) and then used to assess the ecosystem state for the 2050-2059 period, using two contrasting climate change scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). For each condition, a monospecific MSY estimation routine was performed by varying species fishing mortality independently and allowed estimation of reference points for each species. The F-MSY estimated with OSMOSE were mostly in accordance with available values derived from stock assessment and used for fishing advice. Evolution of reference points with climate change was compared across species and highlighted that overexploited cold-water species are likely to have both MSY and F-MSY declining with climate warming. Considering all species together, MSY under RCP scenarios was expected to be higher than historical MSY for half of them, with no clear link with species temperature preferences, exploitation status or trophic level, but in relation with expected change of species biomass under climate change. By contrast, for 80% of cases F-MSY projections showed consistent decreasing pattern as climate conditions changed from historical to RCP scenarios in the Eastern English Channel. This result constitutes a risk for fisheries management, and anticipation of climate change impacts on fish community would require targeting a smaller fishing mortality than F-MSY to ensure sustainable exploitation of marine stocks.",English,Article,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",WOS,,Eastern English Channel (7d),Europe,">100,000",multidecadal,'NOT RELEVANT',day,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey,2,2,3,,,Task 6.2 - climatic and ecological effects on the impact of fisheries management,OSMOSE,OSMOSE,Multi-stock (with species interactions),lesser spotted dogfish_red mullet_pouting_whiting_poor cod_cod_dragonet_sole_plaice_horse mackerel_mackerel_herring_sardinge_squids,Size structured,Fleet not considered,none,No,No spatial context,Yes,growth_reproduction phenology_spatial distribution,No management measures,No,Biological,Yield_MSY,yes,OSMOSE,"Evaluation of changing temperatures under climate change scenarios (RPC4.5/RCP8.5) in a multi-species model could show that both MSY and FMSY are likely declining for overexploited cold-water species, whereas for others MSY did increase due to expected changes of projected biomass.

We used an Ecopath with Ecosim. model to integrate known aspects of the ecosystem and its inhabitants into a single framework, with the aim to gain a better insight into the structure and functioning of the ecosystem and to assess the impacts of fishing in these data-limited fisheries. Model outputs indicate that most of the primary productivity in the system is recycled through a detritus based food web, implying a bottom-up energy flow control. Ecotrophic efficiencies were nevertheless higher at higher trophic levels, suggesting that top-down control mechanisms are also ecologically important. Notwithstanding a high degree of primary productivity, the fishery yields estimated for the coral reef ecosystem were relatively low, apparently because of lower ecotrophic efficiencies at the lower trophic levels. A retrospective simulation of trends in these fisheries using Ecosim showed that, given the existing fishing intensity as suggested by official statistics (0.114 tonnes km(-2) year(-1)), fishery-induced decline in abundance and yield of reef-associated demersals of the magnitude (ca. 25%) suggested by a previous study are unlikely. However, the decline in yield observed in these fisheries could be reproduced in the simulation when the existing fishing level was assumed to be five-fold the official estimate, as suggested by anecdotal evidence on unreported catches. The simulation results show that an optimal fishing strategy could be achieved through a slight reduction in the annual catch of reef-associated fish (to 0.32 tonnes km(-2) year(-1)) and an increase in the capture of near-reef pelagics and large pelagics (to 0.19 and 0.39 tonnes km(-2) year(-1), respectively) from the putative levels. We explored optimal fishing scenarios in view of both direct effects of fishing on target species and indirect effects of fishing on non-target organisms. Finally, this study demonstrates that, even if modeling is no substitute for rigorous assessment of individual fish stocks with more detailed data, it could improve our understanding of the impacts of fishing on the structure and functioning of coral reef ecosystems in such newly developing fisheries, particularly on groups that would otherwise be difficult to monitor.

The BOB model encompassed an area of 24,000 km(2) and had 14 functional ecological groups of which 13 were living groups and one dead group (detritus). The model assessed the trophic relationship, energy flow and interactions between ecological groups. Trophic levels of the compartments varied between 1.0 (for primary producers and detritus) to 3.85 (for shark). The producers particularly phytoplankton and detritus are exploited considerably; hence energy transfer from lower trophic levels was found to be high. Furthermore, all consumers had ecotrophic efficiency (EE) >0.90 indicating that the consumers are heavily exploited in the system. The overall transfer efficiency of the system is 5.9%. The primary production/respiration (Pp/R) ratio was found to be 1.351, which indicated that BOB ecosystem is in the developmental stage and has some sorts of system maturity. The BOB ecosystem showed low ecological efficiency with a value of 0.001547 for the gross efficiency of the fisheries. Mixed trophic impact analysis indicated both phytoplankton and zooplankton to have a positive effect on most of the fish functional groups. The values of ascendancy (38.7) and overhead (61.3) showed the stability of the ecosystem. Findings obtained from the present model confirm that coastal ecosystem of BOB is an exploited ecosystem.

Assessing these technical interactions is of great importance for fishery management, as any control applied to one fishing unit may have positive or negative effects on others. The magnitude and direction of these effects cannot be easily measured, unless all fishing units and species in the fishery are considered simultaneously. Technical interactions are particularly important in the complex artisanal fisheries of the English Channel. Using a bioeconomic model of the English Channel that incorporates all the major fishing units (the BECHAMEL model), we describe a method for measuring and classifying the technical interactions due to the competition for resource (stock externalities). The results are used to develop a typology of mtiers and fleets based on their overall level of interaction for the resource.

A large amount of biological and economic data have been preliminarily gathered, leading to a substantial increase of the quantitative knowledge available. The main purpose of the model is to study the long-term consequences of various management alternatives on the economic situation of the English and French fleets fishing in the area and on exploited resources. The model describes this feature through the links between three entities on the one hand (stocks, fleets and mtiers"", i.e. gear x target species x fishing area), and three modules on the other hand (activity, biological production and economics). The model is described and some simulation results are presented.

An increasingly common strategy to mitigate bycatch of harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena), a small and protected marine top predator, involves the use of pingers (acoustic alarms that emit underwater noise) and time-area fishing closures. Although these mitigation measures can reduce harbor porpoise bycatch in gillnet fisheries considerably, inference about the long-term population-level consequences is currently lacking. We developed a spatially explicit individual-based simulation model (IBM) with the aim to evaluate the effectiveness of these two bycatch mitigation measures. We quantified both the direct positive effects (i.e., reduced bycatch) and any indirect negative effects (i.e., reduced foraging efficiency) on the population size using the inner Danish waters as a biological system. The model incorporated empirical data on gillnet fishing effort and noise avoidance behavior by free-ranging harbor porpoises exposed to randomized high-frequency (20- to 160-kHz) pinger signals. The IBM simulations revealed a synergistic relationship between the implementation of time-area fishing closures and pinger deployment. Time-area fishing closures reduced bycatch rates substantially but not completely. In contrast, widespread pinger deployment resulted in total mitigation of bycatch but frequent and recurrent noise avoidance behavior in high-quality foraging habitat negatively affected individual survival and the total population size. When both bycatch mitigation measures were implemented simultaneously, the negative impact of pinger noise-induced sub-lethal behavioral effects on the population was largely eliminated with a positive effect on the population size that was larger than when the mitigation measures were used independently. Our study highlights that conservationists and policy makers need to consider and balance both the direct and indirect effects of harbor porpoise bycatch mitigation measures before enforcing their widespread implementation.

Control strategies are evaluated with a delay-difference simulation model representing three hypotheses about sardine stock-recruitment relationship, involving the effect of spawning stock size, depensation and cyclic environmental regimes. Strategies are compared by the predicted average catches, catch variability, and probability of stock collapse. Results from simulations are also used to evaluate the relative merits of different types of policies and to evaluate the relative values of reducing the uncertainties about sardine recruitment dynamics. Better understanding of the processes controlling recruitment is mostly needed if the fishery is to continue being managed by effort control. Constant harvest rate policies provide better trade-off among the performance indicators and appears more robust to uncertainties on the prevailing ecological processes controlling recruitment. Results from this analysis are used to discuss the type of research that would most likely provide the information needed to improve the quality of decisions in the purse seine fishery. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In such situations, a single TURF cannot be designed to encompass natural scales of movement while also being small enough to maintain favorable conditions for collective action. A bioeconomic model is used to investigate whether TURF networks have the potential to address this challenge.

Although a full enforcement of the landing obligation has a direct impact on discard reduction through more responsible and selective fishing, fishers argue that it will prompt both a decrease in incomes and an increase in working time onboard. Thus, the measure is in a hold in south-western waters due to the difficulties to implement the ban in mixed fisheries This paper analyzes some possible scenarios which fishers could face under the landing obligation. It is shown the construction of a spatial bio-economic model to infer average costs, incomes and gross profits by fishing ground. We illustrate its use using a coastal trawling fleet based in the northwestern Iberian Peninsula as case study. Results show how fishing ground selection will remain the key factor affecting gross profits, well above the selection of closer fishing grounds, the improvement of fuel efficiency, or extending the length of the fishing trip. Increasing the number of crew members to overcome the expected excess of work time onboard would also be a cost-benefit balanced measure.

It is commonly agreed that marine conservation should expand considerably around the world. However, most countries have not yet implemented large-scale no-take Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). When a country closes a large fraction of its waters to fishing, it stands to lose a considerable level of fishery revenue. Although biodiversity and spillover fishing benefits may far exceed these losses, benefits from large-scale MPAs typically accrue to other countries or to the high seas. Here, to overcome this dilemma, we simulate and test an international fisheries management scheme with transferable fishing rights that incentivizes, rather than hinders, large-scale marine conservation.

In this paper, we develop a dynamic bioeconomic model to analyze the ecological and economic interactions between fisheries and renewable habitat where the habitat provides multiple ecosystem services. Specifically, a single resource manager seeks to maximize co-benefits of fishery-habitat interactions when the habitat is an exploitable marine resource, but also a dwelling place for commercial fish, enhancing the growth of the fish stock and providing regulating ecosystem services in the form of carbon sink for climate change mitigation. The optimal management rules for both fishery and habitat are derived and discussed.

Selective fisheries may impact non-target species as well as limit the productivity of target species if their predators are not harvested. The outcomes of multi-species harvest strategies that include targeting predators depend on ecological and economic constraints, although the development of ecosystem-based management plans has typically focused on ecological constraints. 2. In Chignik, Alaska, sockeye salmon support a valuable commercial fishery and, as juveniles, are preyed upon by coho salmon, a species not subject to a targeted harvest. Whether exploitation of coho salmon would enhance overall fishery value by releasing sockeye salmon from predation constraints is not understood. We employ simulation models to examine the ecological and economic conditions necessary for directly targeting coho salmon to benefit fishers and seafood processors, two distinct but inter-dependent stakeholders in this ecosystem. 3. Model results indicate fishers are likely to experience increased value regardless of economic constraints, as long as coho salmon predation negatively affects sockeye salmon productivity. However, seafood processors are much more limited in the conditions which produce increased economic value, constrained by greater operation costs required to process harvested coho salmon. 4. Synthesis and applications. The unique economic constraints and opportunities of different stakeholders can present contrasting outlooks on the potential benefits of alternative harvest strategies, even if the alternative strategies are predicted to increase yield. The findings herein demonstrate the importance of considering multiple stakeholders when considering alternative management strategies. Depending on the level of risk stakeholders are willing to accept, an active adaptive management strategy reducing coho salmon escapement to low levels could provide valuable information about ecosystem structure as well as potentially providing the greatest economic benefit to the fishery.",English,Article,,,,"Chignik, Alaska",North America,">100,000",multidecadal,'NOT RELEVANT',year,Fisheries Dependent Data_irregular fisheries independent data,'NOT RELEVANT',3,3,"Had we only considered the economics of the harvesting

Higher escapements increase average runs toward biological maximum sustainable yield, but this is driven by infrequent years of very abundant runs. Our economic model shows processors do not add capacity in response to infrequent abundant runs. Therefore, interannual variance in district-specific catch increases because years with little or no fishing become more frequent to meet higher escapement in low-run years, but industry cannot capture greater value in the high-run years. In abundant runs, processors shift available labor to focus on high-volume, lower-margin products; in very abundant years, insufficient processing capacity allows additional fish to escape.

Fisheries' stock assessments have shown a declining population and have led to the implementation of a number of management measures, including a fishing moratorium. This study evaluated the effect of a fishing moratorium on the sustainability of PRE fisheries through an ecosystem approach. Two Ecopath models of the PRE coastal ecosystem in 1998 and 2008 were applied to obtain snapshots of the ecosystem in different periods. An dynamic simulation of the period from 1998 to 2008 was developed using Ecosim based on the assumption that the seasonal moratorium was never applied to the PRE fisheries from 1999 onward, which resulted in the predicted ecosystem of 2008* (the so-called 2008* ecosystem). Then, the attribute indices of the 2008* ecosystem were compared with those of the actual 2008 ecosystem to investigate the effect of the fishing moratorium. Finally, a series of 100 years dynamics simulations was examined according to five scenarios based on the 1998 Ecopath model to explore better strategies for the fishing moratorium. The results show that the 2008* ecosystem was not supposed to feature a seasonal moratorium, as the system in 1999 was more deteriorated, immature and fragile than the actual ecosystem in 2008. The seasonal fishing moratorium did benefit ecosystem protection, although its effect on ecosystem recovery was limited. A comparative analysis of different scenarios indicates that most functional groups will decrease without executing a fishing moratorium (S1). The prolonged moratorium (S2) seemed to be slightly more beneficial to stocks recovery than S0, during which fishing operations were carried out following the present fishing moratorium policy. However, banning all fishing operations during the moratorium season (S3) has little effect on the recovery of fishing stocks from overexploitation. Moreover, reducing the fishing effort by 50% (S4) led to the largest increase in both fish stocks (28.0%) and total landings (43%). © 2015.",English,Article,,Scopus,,Pearl River Estuary,Asia,">100,000",decade,'NOT RELEVANT',year,Fisheries Dependent Data_other (unknown),'NOT RELEVANT',2,2,"All of these factors indicated that the summer moratorium was only play a minor positive role in the restoration process of fish community structure and function in the PRE ecosystem.

Around the UK, scientific assessments have shown a rapid eight-year decline in spawning stock biomass since 2010 attributed to poor recruitment; this was likely driven by environmental factors and high fishing mortality. Management of the stock is informed by scientific assessments in which a population model is fitted to the available data and used to forecast the possible consequences of various catch options. However, the model currently used cannot represent the spatial distribution of the stock or any effects of environmental variability. One approach that may be used to represent the effects of spatial and temporal variation in environmental drivers is with Individual based models (IBMs). In IBMs populations are represented by their constituent individuals that interact with their environment and each other. The mechanistic nature of IBMs is often advantageous as a management tool for complex systems including fisheries. Here we add to an existing IBM to produce a spatio-temporally explicit IBM of the northern stock of sea bass in which individual fish respond to local food supply and sea surface temperature. All life stages (i.e., pelagic stages, juvenile and mature fish) are modelled and individual fish have their own realistic energy budgets driven by observed dynamic maps of phytoplankton density and sea surface temperature. The model is calibrated using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). After calibration by ABC the model gives good fits to key population parameters including spawning stock biomass. The model provides a mechanistic link between observed local food supplies and sea surface temperatures and overall population dynamics. Plots of spatial biomass distribution show how the model uses the energy budget to predict spatial and temporal change in sea bass biomass distribution in response to environmental variability. Our results indicate that the IBM is a promising approach that could be used to support stock assessment with scope for testing a range of spatially and temporally explicit management scenarios in addition to testing stock responses to novel environmental change. © 2022",English,Article,,Scopus,,Around UK: the area from 9?E to 9?W and 48?N to 57.5?N,Europe,">100,000",decade,">100,000",year,Simulated dynamics,2,2,2,"The SS3 model takes all the available data from surveys and literature to assess the state of the stock (ICES, 2021) and outputs modelled ÔdataÕ, so we are fitting the IBM model outputs to another modelÕs outputs.

Such predictions are inherently uncertain, and this can be a barrier to decision-making. The Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources requires managers of Southern Ocean fisheries to sustain the productivity of target stocks, the health and resilience of the ecosystem, and the performance of the fisheries themselves. The managers of the Antarctic krill fishery in the Scotia Sea and southern Drake Passage have requested advice on candidate management measures consisting of a regional catch limit and options for subdividing this among smaller areas. We developed a spatially resolved model that simulates krill-predator-fishery interactions and reproduces a plausible representation of past dynamics. We worked with experts and stakeholders to identify (1) key uncertainties affecting our ability to predict ecosystem state; (2) illustrative reference points that represent the management objectives; and (3) a clear and simple way of conveying our results to decision-makers. We developed four scenarios that bracket the key uncertainties and evaluated candidate management measures in each of these scenarios using multiple stochastic simulations. The model emphasizes uncertainty and simulates multiple ecosystem components relating to diverse objectives. We summarize the potentially complex results as estimates of the risk that each illustrative objective will not be achieved (i.e., of the state being outside the range specified by the reference point). This approach allows direct comparisons between objectives. It also demonstrates that a candid appraisal of uncertainty, in the form of risk estimates, can be an aid, rather than a barrier, to understanding and using ecosystem model predictions. Management measures that reduce coastal fishing, relative to oceanic fishing, apparently reduce risks to both the fishery and the ecosystem.

While static approaches to spatial management rely on one-time assessments of biological, environmental, economic, and/or social conditions, dynamic approaches repeatedly assess conditions to produce regularly updated management recommendations. Owing to this complexity, particularly regarding operational challenges, examples of applied DM are rare. To implement DM, scientific methodologies are operationalized into tools, i.e., self-contained workflows that run automatically at a prescribed temporal frequency (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly). Here we present a start-to-finish framework for operationalizing DM tools, consisting of four stages: Acquisition, Prediction, Dissemination, and Automation. We illustrate this operationalization framework using an applied DM tool as a case study. Our DM tool operates in near real-time and was designed to maximize target catch and minimize bycatch of non-target and protected species in a US-based commercial fishery. It is important to quantify the sensitivity of DM tools to missing data, because dissemination streams for observed (i.e., remotely sensed or directly sampled) data can experience delays or gaps. To address this issue, we perform a detailed example sensitivity analysis using our case study tool. Synthesis and applications. Dynamic management (DM) tools are emerging as viable management solutions to accommodate the biological, environmental, economic, and social variability in our fundamentally dynamic world. Our four-stage operationalization framework and case study can facilitate the implementation of DM tools for a wide array of resource and disturbance management objectives. © 2018 The Authors.

Historically, this resource has been exploited by foreign distant water fleets; however, there is growing interest among United States fishermen and processors to enter this fishery. Several management strategies have been proposed to facilitate increased domestic participation in this fishery. A bioeconomic simulation was conducted to evaluate the alternative management strategies. The simulation model was an age-structured population model to which economic functions were added. Four alternative fishing regimes were evaluated in the analysis: the current fishery, a fishery directed toward pollock >36 cm (small fillet), a fishery directed toward pollock 46 cm (large fillet), and a fishery directed primarily toward small (20-36 cm) pollock for fish paste (surimi). Each fishing regime was simulated over a 20-year period. To account for stochastic variation in the recruitment function, each fishing regime was repeated five times. Results of the simulations indicated that maximum yields of 2.1-2.5 million t can be harvested from the eastern Bering Sea, nearly twice the current level of harvest. The greatest yield was from the fishery for pollock 2:46 cm at 2.5 million t and the least, 2.1 million t, from the surimi fishery. The fishing effort required to harvest at these levels was 60-767% greater than current levels.

Historically, this resource has been exploited by foreign distant water fleets; however, there is growing interest among United States fishermen and processors to enter this fishery. Several management strategies have been proposed to facilitate increased domestic participation in this fishery. A bioeconomic simulation was conducted to evaluate the alternative management strategies. The simulation model was an age-structured population model to which economic functions were added. Four alternative fishing regimes were evaluated in the analysis: the current fishery, a fishery directed toward pollock >36 cm (small fillet), a fishery directed toward pollock 46 cm (large fillet), and a fishery directed primarily toward small (20-36 cm) pollock for fish paste (surimi). Each fishing regime was simulated over a 20-year period. To account for stochastic variation in the recruitment function, each fishing regime was repeated five times. Results of the simulations indicated that maximum yields of 2.1-2.5 million t can be harvested from the eastern Bering Sea, nearly twice the current level of harvest. The greatest yield was from the fishery for pollock 2:46 cm at 2.5 million t and the least, 2.1 million t, from the surimi fishery. The fishing effort required to harvest at these levels was 60-767% greater than current levels.

We constructed an analytical framework for explicitly calculating how coordination affects management decisions, ecosystem state and the provision of ecosystem services in relation to ecosystem dynamics and socio-economic objectives. The central insight is that the appropriate comparison strategy to optimal coordinated management is optimal uncoordinated management, which can be identified at the game theoretic Nash equilibrium. Using this insight we can calculate coordination's effects in relation to uncoordinated management and other reference scenarios. To illustrate how this framework can help identify ecosystem and socio-economic conditions under which coordination is most influential and valuable, we applied it to a heuristic case study and a simulation model for the California Current Marine Ecosystem. Results indicate that coordinated management can more than double an ecosystem's societal value, especially when sectors can effectively manipulate resources that interact strongly. However, societal gains from coordination will need to be reconciled with observations that it also leads to strategic simplification of the ecological food web, and generates both positive and negative impacts on individual sectors and non-target species. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.",English,Article,,Scopus,,Northern Californian,North America,'NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT',Simulated dynamics,'NOT RELEVANT','NOT RELEVANT',2,,,Task 6.5 - management strategies,Other (Ecosystem model),Other (Ecosystem model),Multi-stock (with species interactions),NOT RELEVANT,Biomass aggregated,Fleet not considered,,Yes,No spatial context,No,,Output control ,No,Biological,Prey growth rate,no,NOT RELEVANT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_1427,Despoti,C.

We investigate the impacts of forecasted climate change on the eastern Bering Sea food web through the end of the century under mediumand high emissions climate scenarios in combination with a selection of fisheries management strategies by conducting simulations using a dynamic food web model. The outputs from three global earth system models run under two greenhouse gas emission scenarios were dynamically downscaled using a regional ocean and biogeochemical model to project ecosystem dynamics at the base of the food web. Four fishing scenarios were explored: status quo, no fishing, and two scenarios that alternatively assume increased fishing emphasis on either gadids or flatfishes. Annual fishery quotas were dynamically simulated by combining harvest control rules based on model-simulated stock biomass, while incorporating social and economic tradeoffs induced by the Bering Sea's combined groundfish harvest cap. There was little predicted difference between the status quo and no fishing scenario for most managed groundfish species biomasses at the end of the century, regardless of emission scenario. Under the status quo fishing scenario, biomass projections for most species and functional groups across trophic levels showed a slow but steady decline toward the end of the century, and most groups were near or below recent historical (1991-2017) biomass levels by 2080. The bottom-up effects of declines in biomass at lower trophic levels as forecasted by the climate-enhanced lower trophic level modeling, drove the biomass trends at higher trophic levels. By 2080, the biomass projections for species and trophic guilds showed very little difference between emission scenarios.

In this paper, we want to take a critical look at the reasons behind this situation and propose steps that need to be taken to change it. We investigate a number of good practice examples from fields where models have influenced policy-making and management to identify the main aspects that promote or impede the application of these models. Specifically, we compare examples that differ in their extent to how explicitly they represent human behaviour as part of the model, ranging from purely environmental systems (including models for river management, honeybee colonies and animal diseases), where modelling techniques have long been established, to coupled socio-environmental systems (including models for land use, fishery management and sustainable water use). We use these examples to synthesise four key factors for successful modelling for policy and management support in socio-environmental systems. They cover (a) the specific requirements caused by modelling the human dimension, (b) the importance of data availability and accessibility, (c) essential elements of the partnership between modellers and decision-makers and (d) insights related to characteristics of the decision process. For each of these aspects, we give recommendations specifically to modellers, decision-makers or both to make the use of models for practice more effective. We argue that if all parties involved in the modelling and decision-making process take into account these suggestions during their collaboration, the full potential that socio-environmental modelling bears can increasingly unfold.

However, legal constraints or differing management objectives may not permit such coordinated decision making and policy development. This study introduces a framework for effectively simulating fleet dynamics, fishery quota allocation, and the implications of alternative management strategies while allowing for determination of economically optimal management approaches at the community level. As a case study, an agent-based model (ABM) was developed to examine the interplay between transboundary management scenarios on the economic viability of a nascent Alaska state-waters trawl fishery for walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) in the Gulf of Alaska, given a longstanding federally managed fishery. Under conditions characteristic of the recent past, the management strategy that produced the best overall improvements, relative to status quo, involved a scenario that allows for community-based cooperatives in federal-waters and an open access strategy in state-waters.

Key challenges of ecosystem modeling lie in the insufficient quantity and quality of data, which is unfortunately common in the marine ecosystems of many developing countries. In this study, we aim to model the dynamics of multispecies fisheries under data-limited circumstances, using a multispecies size-spectrum model (MSSM) implemented in the coastal ecosystem of North Yellow Sea, China. To make most of available data, we incorporated a range of data-limited methods for estimating the life-history parameters and conducted model validation according to empirical data. Additionally, sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the impacts of input parameters on model predictions regarding the uncertainty of data and estimating methods. Our results showed that MSSM could provide reasonable predictions of community size spectra and appropriately reflect the community composition in the studied area, whereas the predictions of fisheries yields were biased for certain species. Errors in recruitment parameters were most influential on the prediction of species abundance, and errors in fishing efforts substantially affected community-level indicators. This study built a framework to integrate parameter estimation, model validation, and sensitivity analyses altogether, which could guide model development in similar mixed and data-limited fisheries and promote the use of size-spectrum model for ecosystem-based fisheries management. © Copyright © 2020 Wo, Zhang, Pan, Xu, Xue and Ren.",English,Article,,Scopus,,"North Yellow Sea, China",Asia,">100,000",multidecadal,'NOT RELEVANT',multidecadal,,'NOT RELEVANT',2,,"Our results showed that Multispecies Size Spectrum Models could provide reasonable predictions of community size spectra and appropriately reflect the community composition in the studied area, whereas the predictions of fisheries yields were biased for certain species.",,Task 6.2 - climatic and ecological effects on the impact of fisheries management,Other (Multispecies Size-spectrum Model (MSSM)),Other (Multispecies Size-spectrum Model (MSSM)),Multi-stock (with species interactions),Many species of fish and other organisms,Size structured,Fleet not considered,,No,Spatially implicit,No,,Input  control,Not clear,Ecosystem based,Biomass_mortality_predation mortality,yes,"Trophic fish-R, to use ELFAN (lenght-frequency)","Our results showed that Multispecies Size Spectrum Models could provide reasonable predictions of community size spectra and appropriately reflect the community composition in the studied area, whereas the predictions of fisheries yields were biased for certain species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_1439,Savina,M.

Through its three decades of evolution, the approach became increasingly popular, with over three hundred Ecopath models being published to date. During its first 10-15 years, the approach was mainly used as a tool to integrate ecological and fisheries data to understand and visualize the trophic flow structure of ecosystems, thereby allowing for the meaningful comparisons between systems. Later (since the mid-1990s) it was increasingly used to explore ecosystem changes under the impact of management or climate impact scenarios. This evolution from a more descriptive mass-balance to a simulation modelling tool was enabled through fundamental changes in the mathematical architecture: the original version of Ecopath was based on linear algebra for input-output analysis to investigate the properties of steady state networks, while in the recent version, coupled differential equations are used for each of the defined system compartments. The new model architecture thus allows the magnitude of flows in and out of compartments to change over time, which makes simulations of changes possible. Foraging arena theory was also taken into account and prey biomass was allowed to vary in its availability (vulnerability) to predators. If the predators consumption is mainly determined by prey availability (bottom-up control, low vulnerability), predator biomass would greatly respond to changes in prey biomass, while under a situation of strong predator (top-down) control, changes in predator biomass would greatly impact its prey (high vulnerability). Since EwE also allows for specifying different resource use types (e.g. types of fisheries or other resource uses) and economic variables associated to them (operational costs, number of people employed etc.), different management regimes can also be explored in terms of their socio-economic outcome. If spatially explicit data on biomass distribution of model groups and dispersal rate values are available, the Ecospace module of the EwE package may be used to derive at a spatially explicit, dynamic trophic model able to simulate how the management of one part of the system area may affect other parts. The incorporation of these spatial dynamics is of particular interest in the exploration of management questions, such as in the size and placement of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) (this application is not further described in this chapter). © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",English,,,Scopus,Article type (book chapter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SW6_1440,Tsoukali,H.

These provisions, along with other catch-quota balancing mechanisms, are meant to aid fishers in matching available quota to actual catch so that incentives to discard are reduced. In this paper, we use a bioeconomic model to examine how species-transformation provisions affect sustainability and profitability of a multispecies fishery. We base parameterization of the model loosely on management of the Icelandic demersal fishery, which currently employs one of the broadest implementations of species transformations. To represent fisher behaviour in each year, effort is allocated among two or three mtiers, such that total profit for that year is maximized. Each mtier represents a combination of three species' catchability rates that define which species are targeted by each mtier and how independent a species' catch rate is from that of other species. Assumptions regarding the degree to which fishers can target specific species by shifting effort between mtiers, as well as how relative profitability among mtiers varies, are paramount to understanding more generally how fishing regulations such as species transformations can be expected to change fishing patterns. This constraint depends not only on how strongly associated species catches are within a mtier but also on relative species abundance and what alternate mtiers are available. © 2016 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2016.

This impedes the implementation of SSFM in an ecosystem context and reduces our ability to understand the possible ecological impacts of fishing activities. This study focuses on two economically important species in the Jiaozhou Bay, China: the short-lived, fast-growing, and relatively abundant Japanese mantis shrimp (Oratosquilla oratoria) and the long-lived, slow-growing, and less abundant Korean rockfish (Sebastes schlegelii). We evaluated how varying trophic interactions influenced O. oratoria and S. schlegelii (i.e., target-species) who were managed under constant fishing pressure. The increase of fishing pressure to other species (i.e., non-target species) was beneficial to O. oratoria and S. schlegelii. O. oratoria was more sensitive to the decrease of fishing pressure to other species. The predation mortality of age-0 O. oratoria increased with the increased fishing pressure to other species. The predation mortality of age-1 O. oratoria and age-0 S. schlegelii had negative relationships with the fishing pressure to other species. Age-1 S. schlegelii seemed not to be sensitive to the changes in trophic interactions. The predation mortality of O. oratoria and S. schlegelii had bigger changes than the starvation mortality after fishing changed. It suggested the prey-predator relationship had a bigger impact than the food competition. The increase of high-trophic-level fish Johnius belangerii fishery positively impacted O. oratoria, but negatively impacted S. schlegelii.

We implemented an end-to-end model OSMOSE-JZB (Object-oriented Simulator of Marine ecOSystem Exploitation OSMOSE) modelling ecosystem in the Jiaozhou Bay located in China to evaluate the impact of pulse fishing on the effectiveness of seasonal closure at levels of fish community, population, and individual.

However, the use of ecosystem models is still limited in tactical fisheries management due to large uncertainties that undermine the confidence of stakeholders. Using a Monte Carlo simulation approach, this study quantified the impact of imprecise parameters on performance of a multi-species individual-based model OSMOSE (Object-oriented Simulator of Marine Ecosystems Exploitation) in evaluating the status of fish community, population, and individual. Uncertainties associated with the following five parameters were considered: fishing mortality (M-fishing), additional natural mortality (M-natural), larval mortality (M-larval), species-specific relative fecundity (RF), and the proportion of available low trophic level (LTL) biomass to high trophic level (HTL) groups (Plank access). The imprecise value of M-larval had the highest relative influence on model outputs. The imprecision of model outputs were sharply increased when the imprecisions of RF and Plank access were high. The compound sources resulted in a greater imprecision of model predictions, confirming that the hierarchical model structure of OSMOSE facilitated the error diffusion. We also investigated the synergetic and antagonistic effects of aforementioned parameter uncertainty on the total biomass of the community (Bio(com)) and mean trophic level of the community (mTL(com)). Both Bio(com) and mTL(com) seemed not sensitive to the changes in M-natural. The M-fishing and M10,,,,1 had negative effects on mTL(com), and there was a positive relationship between two ecological indicators and last two parameters (RF and Plank.access). The M-larval had a dominant impact on Bioco, and mTLcom. Increasing Mftthing and could result in a larger decline of Bio(com) and mTL(com) compared to that caused by a single parameter. Similarly, there was a larger increase of Bio(com) and mTL(com) after increasing RF and Plank access. There was a small variation of Bio(com) and mTL(com) when both M-fishing and RF changed, suggesting M-fishing could offset the effect of RF on Bio(com) and mTL(com).

However, the implementation of such integrated models has been limited due to lack of data, and their performance in advising fisheries management has been rarely evaluated. We developed an end-to-end model (OSMOSE-JZB) representing organisms of high and low trophic levels in the Jiaozhou Bay, a temperate bay in China with limited available data. We evaluated the performance of the model for simulating the ecosystem dynamics by comparing the model-predicted species biomass, size structure, trophic level, and mortality with relevant data derived from scientific surveys and literature. In general, the model-predicted species biomass and size ranges were consistent with observations. However, the size structure of the two dominant fish species showed some discrepancies between the model simulations and observations. The predicted mean trophic levels from OSMOSE-JZB were closer to the values derived from an Ecopath model of the same region, compared to the values derived from empirical isotope analysis. The model's output suggested that predation mortality appeared to be the main source of mortality for younger individuals compared to starvation and fishing mortality.

The parameterized model shows that, for a wide range of scenarios, the fishery will be better off in terms of both conservation and economic objectives when the no-take reserve is established in conjunction with the B-MEY target rather than with the B-MSY target. Model results further show that the opportunity cost of securing additional fish biomass, in both deterministic and stochastic environments, is lower when the reserve size is increased under the B-MEY target.

We assessed the global stock status and found that 68% were at or above the MSY level in 2008 and that the 2015 target is unlikely to be met. We compiled data for eight indicators to evaluate the sustainability of fisheries and the gap to meet the WSSD target.

This management system was introduced relatively recently (mid-1990s). Given the importance of fishing to the Faroe economy and culture, considerable interest has been expressed in the evaluation of these new management measures at the ecosystem level. We used Ecopath with Ecosim to examine alternative management options for the Faroe Islands fisheries and compared these options with the status quo. Spatially explicit simulations were carried out using the Ecospace routine. Simulations suggest that current area closures could be considered beneficial in conserving major stocks of demersal species, with biomass for cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and other demersal species increasing over the 10-year simulation period. Simulated removal of the closure system reduced the effect of the projected stock increases considerably. Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), one of the major deep-water species, and blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou), one of the main pelagic species, did not benefit from the existing spatial management. Simulated additional offshore closures of at least 20% of habitats deeper than 200 m benefited Greenland halibut only. Both, Greenland halibut and blue whiting stocks benefited from drastic reductions in fishing effort (between 20 and 50% reductions from 1997 effort levels).

In addition, the quality of coastal ecosystems has been degraded. Although a variety of approaches has been applied to improve the management of fisheries and to facilitate the recovery of depleted fisheries resources in Korea, they have not been wholly successful due to a lack of information on the history of fishing, exploitable biomass, and the current state of fisheries, compared to reference points, such as exploitable carrying capacity (ECC) and potential biomass yield (PBY). In this study, we reviewed the ECC and PBY of sectors in the East China Sea, Yellow Sea, and East Sea/Sea of Japan LMEs using the ecosystem modeling method (EMM) and holistic production method (HPM). EMM uses a mass-balanced ecosystem model, Ecopath with Ecosim, together with fishery catch and ecological data for each species group. HPM utilizes time-series catch and fishing effort data for all species combined. Estimates of the ECC for sectors in the East China Sea, Yellow Sea, and East Sea/Sea of Japan LMEs from these two approaches were similar with values 5.49Ð6.42 million metric tons (mmt), 1.35Ð1.36 mmt, and 1.42Ð1.81 mmt, respectively. Estimates of PBY were also similar for the two approaches with values 1.02Ð1.03 mmt for the East China Sea, 0.18Ð0.26 mmt for the Yellow Sea, and 0.27Ð0.34 mmt for the East Sea/Sea of Japan. The exploitable biomass began to decline from the early 1970s in the Yellow Sea and the mid-1970s in the East Sea/Sea of Japan and East China Sea, when over-fishing commenced. The current exploitable biomass for the LMEs are about 30Ð40% of those of the late 1960s. The ecosystem risk index (ERI) was highest for the Yellow Sea at 2.17, while the ERI was 1.95 for the East China Sea and 1.87 for the East Sea/Sea of Japan. Finally, we introduce a practical approach to achieve sustainable ecosystem-based fisheries assessment and management in LMEs, since most commercially important fisheries include species that migrate seasonally across the national boundaries of Korea, Japan, and China. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,,Scopus,,"East China Sea, Yellow Sea, and East Sea/Sea of Japan LMEs",Asia,">100,000",multidecadal,"50,000-100,000",snapshot/no repeat sampling,Fisheries Dependent Data,2,2,2,,"This seems to take Ecosim results, but the ytexy is not extremely clear",Task 6.4 - targets and limits for indicators in an ecosystem context ,EwE,EwE,Ecosystem model,functional groups,Biomass aggregated,Fleet not considered,,No,No spatial context,No,,No management measures,No,Biological,catches_biomass,yes,EwE,"While the model discusses several areas, these are described by individual EwEs.

The uncertainty was assumed to result from errors in fish life-history and metabolic scale parameters, environmental variability, fishing variability, and sampling errors.

Size-spectrum models that explicitly account for trophic interactions are used to simulate community dynamics under different levels of fishing pressure, including a specific model of the fish community in Haizhou Bay, China, and trait-based models of generalised fishery systems. The sensitivity of EIs is characterised by (1) responsiveness, which refers to the dynamics of EI values with respect to the magnitude of changes in fishing effort, and (2) detectability, which measures the relative changes of EI with respect to reference baselines. The response of EIs is substantially non-linear over time. Most EIs are responsive to the reduction of fishing effort and have low detectability under high fishing pressure. Both characteristics of sensitivity tend to increase in the early years and level off in 2 decades, suggesting transient behaviours in EI dynamics. The results suggested the essential non-linear dynamics of EIs resulting from underlying trophic interactions and the potential misinterpretation of the temporal EIs dynamics.

This paper presents the framework for the bioeconomic model and risk assessment for all components of a stock enhancement operation, i.e. hatchery, grow-out, releasing, population dynamics, fishery, and monitoring, for a commercial scale enhancement of about 100 metric tonnes, a 25% increase in average annual catch in Exmouth Gulf. The model incorporates uncertainty in estimates of parameters by using a distribution for the parameter over a certain range, based on experiments, published data, or similar studies. Monte Carlo simulation was then used to quantify the effects of these uncertainties on the model-output and on the economic potential of a particular production target. The model incorporates density-dependent effects in the nursery grounds of brown tiger prawns.

This paper presents the framework for the bioeconomic model and risk assessment for all components of a stock enhancement operation, i.e. hatchery, grow-out, releasing, population dynamics, fishery, and monitoring, for a commercial scale enhancement of about 100 metric tonnes, a 25% increase in average annual catch in Exmouth Gulf. The model incorporates uncertainty in estimates of parameters by using a distribution for the parameter over a certain range, based on experiments, published data, or similar studies. Monte Carlo simulation was then used to quantify the effects of these uncertainties on the model-output and on the economic potential of a particular production target.

We developed such a general risk-assessment framework and applied it to chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) stocks in the Arctic-Yukon-Kuskokwim region of Alaska, USA. These stocks experienced low abundance in the 1990s, which led to declarations of economic disaster and calls for changes in harvest strategies. Our stochastic model provides decision makers with quantitative information about trade-offs among commercial harvest, subsistence harvest, and spawner abundance. The model included outcome uncertainty (the difference between target and realized spawner abundances) in the subsistence and commercial catch modules. We also used closed-loop simulations to investigate the utility of time-varying management policies in which target spawner abundance changed in response to changes in the Ricker productivity parameter (a), as estimated with a Kalman filter. Time-varying policies resulted in higher escapements and catches and reduced risk across a range of harvest rates.

Standing stocks were quantified and population parameters (growth, mortality and recruitment) determined for both species. These data were used to derive empirical estimates of maximum sustainable yield (MSY) for P. granutina and P. argenvillei (7,4 and 1,5 tons wet foot mass respectively). The population parameters were also used in the development of a length-based simulation model to provide a second estimate of MSY for P. granatina (up to 12,9 tons). Small-scale experimental harvesting showed that both species recovered extremely slowly if all limpets were removed (total clearance). When the harvest was size-selective (partial clearance), with P. granatina >60 mm and P. argenvillei > 75 mm being removed, P. granatina failed to recover after 13 months but P. argenvillei recovered within 15 months. Partial and total clearance led to enhanced growth and survival of the remaining limpets. Partial clearance of P. granatina had no effect on other species in the community, but partial and total removal of P. argenvillei resulted in increased cover of sessile filter-feeders and macroalgae as well as a decrease in the cover of encrusting coralline algae It is concluded that the potential exists for the development of an economically viable and ecologically sustainable fishery. Empirically derived quotas and minimum size limits of 60 mm for P. granatina and 75 mm for P. argenvillei are suggested as the chief mechanisms for regulating a potential fishery.

Here, we explore available approaches for estimating the vulnerabilities to simulate the effects of a dragnet prohibition with and without reallocation of fishing effort. Simulations suggest that banning dragnets would be beneficial for the fishing community judged by the increase in biomass of functional groups and fishers' profits, but not if dragnet fishers were to continue fishing in the bay by reallocating to other gears, indicated by the reduced fish biomass and fishers' profits. The overall trend (decreasing or increasing) in the changes of functional groups, ecosystem indicators, and profits were relatively consistent across vulnerability settings, illustrating that an unfitted EwE model can be used for qualitative management strategy exploration.",English,Article; Early Access,,WOS,,"Chwaka Bay (Zanzibar, Western Indian Ocean)",Asia,"5,000-10,000",multidecadal,'NOT RELEVANT',year,Simulated dynamics,2,2,3,"The overall trend (decreasing or increasing) in the changes of functional groups, ecosystem indicators, and profits were relatively consistent across vulnerability settings, illustrating that an unfitted EwE model can be used for qualitative management strategy exploration.","Here, we explore available approaches for estimating the vulnerabilities to simulate the effects of a dragnet prohibition with and

MSE has become a key method to evaluate trade-offs between management objectives and to communicate with decision makers. Here we describe how and why MSE is continuing to grow from a single species approach to one relevant to multi-species and ecosystem based management. In particular, different ecosystem modeling approaches can fit within the MSE process to meet particular natural resource management needs. We present four case studies that illustrate how MSE is expanding to include ecosystem considerations and ecosystem models as 'operating models' (i.e., virtual test worlds), to simulate monitoring, assessment, and harvest control rules, and to evaluate tradeoffs via performance metrics. We highlight United States case studies related to fisheries regulations and climate, which support NOAA's policy goals related to the Ecosystem Based Fishery Roadmap and Climate Science Strategy but vary in the complexity of population, ecosystem, and assessment representation. We emphasize methods, tool development, and lessons learned that are relevant beyond the United States, and the additional benefits relative to single-species MSE approaches.",English,Article,gold,WOS,Article type,,,,,,,,,,,,A summary of 4-different case studies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
