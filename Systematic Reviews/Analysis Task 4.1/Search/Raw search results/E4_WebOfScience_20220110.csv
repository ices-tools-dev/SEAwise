Knowledge about the repeatability of the results of a given sampling tool is an important part of planning sample collection schedules. The aim of this research was to evaluate the variance in the abundance and length of herring larvae (6.9-24.4 mm SL) collected with 505 bongo nets during 12 cruises conducted during April-June at 6-9 stations in the Pomeranian Bay, Baltic Sea, from 2015 to 2018. The differences (mean value of % deviation from the mean) between the left and right bongo nets (compared during 17 tows) were 21.6% for larval abundance and 3.6% for the SL measurement. When three tows were subsequently conducted at the same station (compared at 6 stations), the differences were 19.7% and 10.1% for abundance and the SL assessment, respectively. When samples were collected at the same stations on consecutive days (compared for 75 paired days), the error was 33.4% for abundance and 6.1% for SL. Several factors (filtered-water volume, larval abundance, larval size, wind strength, and station location) were tested for their effect on the magnitude of the variations, but only sampled larvae abundance was found to be significant with lower precision for low abundance. Although the above low precision level did not significantly affect the overall assessment of larval abundance and SL within the investigated geographical area within a given year, it should be considered that differences of ca. +/- 10% (for SL) and ca. +/- 33% (for abundance) are within the sampling method errors, which correspond to ca. thirteen percent (for SL) and 200% (for abundance) of the absolute differences expressed as % of the lower value. While the present results were obtained for herring, we believe that the conclusions are also applicable to early life stages of other fish species, especially clupeids such as sprat, menhaden, and smelt.;"[Fey, Dariusz P.] Natl Marine Fisheries Res Inst, Dept Fisheries Oceanog & Marine Ecol, Ul Kollataja 1, PL-81332 Gdynia, Poland; [Szkudlarek-Pawelczyk, Agnieszka] Natl Marine Fisheries Res Inst, Dept Fisheries Oceanog & Marine Ecol, Res Stn Swinoujscie, Gdynia, Poland";;Fey, DP (corresponding author), Natl Marine Fisheries Res Inst, Dept Fisheries Oceanog & Marine Ecol, Ul Kollataja 1, PL-81332 Gdynia, Poland.;dfey@mir.gdynia.pl;;;;;48;0;0;1;1;ELSEVIER;AMSTERDAM;RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0165-7836;1872-6763;FISH RES;Fish Res.;FEB;2022;246;;;;;;;106165;10.1016/j.fishres.2021.106165;;;10;Fisheries;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Fisheries;XA8VY;WOS:000720919400006;;hybrid;;;10/01/2022

Bycatch events are one of the major sources of anthropogenic mortality of species of conservation interest in the world. T. truncatus is a plastic species and the more frequently observed species in the Adriatic Sea owing to the natural tendency to interact with the fishing activities in the area. This case report describes the acoustic parameters detected in whistle spectral contours associated with low-frequency signals recorded with a passive acoustic monitoring device in an exceptional event of bycatch that involved three individuals during a midwater commercial trawling in the Adriatic Sea. Marine mammal vocal elements have been investigated for decades to assess whether they correlate with stress levels or stress indicators. Due to their acoustic plasticity, the interpretation of dolphins' acoustic signals of has been studied most extensively. This work describes the acoustic parameters detected in whistle spectral contours, collected using passive acoustic monitoring (PAM), in a bycatch event that involved three Bottlenose dolphins during midwater commercial trawling. The results indicate a total number of 23 upsweep whistles recorded during the bycatch event, that were analyzed based on the acoustic parameters as follows: (Median; 25th percentile; 75th percentile) D-r (second), total duration (1.09; 0.88; 1.24); f(min) (HZ), minimum frequency (5836.4; 5635.3; 5967.1); f(max) (HZ), maximum frequency, (11,610 +/- 11,293; 11,810); f(c) (HZ), central frequency; (8665.2; 8492.9; 8982.8); BW (HZ), bandwidth (5836.4; 5635.3; 5967.1); Step, number of step (5; 4; 6). Furthermore, our data show that vocal production during the capture event was characterized by an undescribed to date combination of two signals, an ascending whistle (upsweep), and a pulsed signal that we called low-frequency signal in the frequency band between 4.5 and 7 kHz. This capture event reveals a novel aspect of T. truncatus acoustic communication, it confirms their acoustic plasticity, and suggests that states of discomfort are conveyed through their acoustic repertoire.";"[Corrias, Valentina; Sciacca, Virginia; Filiciotto, Francesco] Natl Res Council CNR ISP, Inst Polar Sci, I-98122 Messina, Italy; [Corrias, Valentina] Univ Tuscia, Dept Ecol & Biol DEB, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy; [Corrias, Valentina; de Lucia, Giuseppe Andrea] Natl Res Council CNR IAS, Inst Anthrop Impact & Sustainabil Marine Environm, I-09170 Oristano, Italy; [de Vincenzi, Giovanni; Sciacca, Virginia] eConsci Art Soundscape, Via Provinciale 610, I-90046 Palermo, Italy; [Ceraulo, Maria] Natl Res Council CNR IAS, Inst Anthrop Impact & Sustainabil Marine Environm, I-91021 Trapani, Italy; [Sala, Antonello] Natl Res Council CNR IRBIM, Inst Marine Biol Resources & Biotechnol, I-60125 Ancona, Italy";;"Corrias, V (corresponding author), Natl Res Council CNR ISP, Inst Polar Sci, I-98122 Messina, Italy.; Corrias, V (corresponding author), Univ Tuscia, Dept Ecol & Biol DEB, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy.; Corrias, V (corresponding author), Natl Res Council CNR IAS, Inst Anthrop Impact & Sustainabil Marine Environm, I-09170 Oristano, Italy.";"virg.sciacca@gmail.com; gioggio.devincenzi@gmail.com; ceraulo.maria@gmail.com; virg.sciacca@gmail.com; antonello.sala@cnr.it; giuseppe.delucia@cnr.it; francesco.filiciotto@cnr.it";"; Sala, Antonello/B-8517-2016";"Ceraulo, Maria/0000-0003-2140-1367; Sala, Antonello/0000-0001-7066-1152";;;34;0;0;0;0;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;2076-2615;;ANIMALS-BASEL;Animals;DEC;2021;11;12;;;;;;3593;10.3390/ani11123593;;;7;"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology";XV9EC;WOS:000735234900001;34944368;Green Published;;;10/01/2022

Purse-seine fishery, as one of the biggest marine fishery sub-sectors, has a pioneering socioecological influence within the marine fisheries sector of Turkey. In this study, we examined the technical efficiencies of the Turkish purse-seine vessels along the Aegean coasts of Turkey. To implement this analysis, we first collected a data set of technical and economic dimensions of active Turkish purse-seine vessels in the Aegean Sea. Then, we used two-stage Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approaches, including input-oriented bootstrapped DEA under constant and various returns-to-scale technologies. In the first stage, we calculated bootstrapped efficiencies across vessels by using technical factors of fisheries production and harvest value as input/ output factors. At the second stage, we performed an in-depth analysis of the endogenous determinants of the efficiency scores by using the statistical models under various statistical specifications. We found that most of the purse seine vessels in fleet segment 1 (<24 m) got low-efficiency scores (<0.30) while efficiency scores of fleet segment 2 (>= 24 m) emerged to have scores that were homogeneously distributed between 0 and 1. Landing amounts and landing values of fleet segment 1 appeared to have superior efficient frontier levels compared with fleet segment 2 although fleet segment 2 had substantially positive relationships with the predicted efficiency scores. Higher engine power, as well as higher numbers of crew onboard, did not statistically explain neither desired efficiency scores nor expected landings and market values. Overall, various excess production inputs, including gross tonnage, engine power, total generator power, lamp boat generator power, were predicted to be in excess use. To conclude, fisheries managers should account for the operational performance of the fishing vessels to better design optimal fisheries policies in the future.;"[Tunca, Sezgin; Gulec, Ozlem; Tosunoglu, Zafer] Ege Univ, Fac Fisheries, Izmir, Turkey";;Tunca, S (corresponding author), Ege Univ, Fac Fisheries, Izmir, Turkey.;sezgin.tunca@gmail.com;;;Ege University Scientific Research Project Coordination UnitEge University [FYL-2019-20581];The present study was funded by the Ege University Scientific Research Project Coordination Unit (Project No. FYL-2019-20581).

Forty-three percent of a subsample of 1000 pots contained snow crabs, with an average of three crabs per pot. Most of the crabs were alive (~98%) and dominated by large males. Pinch injuries and limb loss were common and tended to decline with increasing crab size. Reflex testing showed that the crabs were vital (i.e. the crabs moved their legs, chelipeds and maxillipeds when stimulated), which was supported by a relatively high meat content. However, energy reserves in the digestive glands (hepatopancreas reserves) were low, indicating overall energy deficiencies. Our results indicate considerable unaccounted mortality due to self-baiting, continued catch and cannibalism. The findings demonstrate that snow crab pots which are lost or abandoned in the Barents Sea fishery maintain huge potential for ghostfishing impacts.;"[Humborstad, Odd-Borre; Lokkeborg, Svein; Ingolfsson, Olafur Arnar] Inst Marine Res, POB 1870, N-5817 Bergen, Norway; [Eliassen, Lasse Kroger] Univ Oslo, POB 1072, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Siikavuopio, Sten Ivar] Norwegian Inst Fisheries & Aquaculture Res, N-9291 Tromso, Norway; [Hjelset, Ann Merete] Inst Marine Res, POB 6066, N-9296 Tromso, Norway";;Humborstad, OB (corresponding author), Inst Marine Res, POB 1870, N-5817 Bergen, Norway.;oddb@hi.no;;;;;28;0;0;1;1;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0025-326X;1879-3363;MAR POLLUT BULL;Mar.

J;Maynou, F;Maynou, Francesc;Trade-offs between employment and profitability in a Mediterranean Sea mixed bottom trawl fishery;REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE;English;Article;;;;;;"Effort allocation; Mixed fisheries; Trawl fisheries; Optimization; Mediterranean sea";MANAGEMENT;The exploitation of mixed fisheries leads to trade-offs between fisheries rent, production (landings) and resource conservation because harvest rent cannot be optimized simultaneously for all species. Additionally, the exploitation of mixed fisheries by heterogeneous fleets complicates their management because of the necessity to allocate catch or effort quotas, under some criterion of efficiency or equitability. The allocation of fishing opportunities impacts directly on the availability of jobs in fisheries. To analyse the trade-offs between employment and profits in mixed fisheries, an optimization bioeconomic model was built for the three bottom-trawl fleet segments operating in the Catalonia demersal fishery (NW Mediterranean Sea). The fishery is subject to a multiannual management plan to align fishing effort with the fisheries mortality that would produce the maximum sustainable yield. The optimal effort allocation among the three fleet segments were compared subject to alternative fisheries management policies: (i) maximum sustainable yield, (ii) maximum economic yield, (iii) maximum labour remuneration, (iv) pretty good yield, and (v) equilibrium biomass larger than biomass at maximum sustainable yield, taking into account the multispecies nature of the fishery. The results show that all management policies provide higher profits than current. In the first three scenarios, high profitability can be made compatible with a lower number of better paid jobs, because the optimal allocation of effort in most scenarios would imply a reduction in the number of vessels. The results also show that the current number of vessels and effort distribution (which are the result of a historical process, rather than the results of a management strategy) are far from any optimum.

This negative trend has been particularly severe along the Mediterranean coast of Spain, where most clam stocks have collapsed in the last decades. Management responses to reconcile declining fisheries typically include closing areas to fishing. This study evaluated the effect of fishing closure on the Callista chione bed on the Maresme coast, which was among the most productive fishing grounds. At the same time, this study examined the direct impact of mechanized clam dredges on the megabenthic assemblages. The same locations were surveyed in 2005 (regular fishing activity) and 2020 (5 years after the official fishing closure). The closure of the clam fishing area has not helped in the recovery of the C. chione stock. Changes in C. chione biology and population dynamics were found. However, the diversity in the macrobenthic community has increased. Species with fragile shells or vermiform soft bodies have become more abundant or have appeared. These species are also among those most affected by mechanized clam dredging activity. The data suggest that active management actions are required (e.g. restocking) to recover the C. chione population in the medium term. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

In quota-regulated fisheries, intra- and inter-temporal substitutions of fishing effort is regarded as a key mechanisms that influences the profitability of the fishing portfolio. The feeding and spawning migration patterns of the available fish species in the fishing portfolio alter the bio-economic conditions of the different fishing areas. In addition, the spatial heterogeneity among different fishing areas in terms of the fuel costs and travel distance, accessibility to other fishing fleets, and sea ice extent affects the relative attractiveness of the fishing areas and further complicates the decisions underlying the effort allocation, such as when and where to fish what and how much to fish to maximize the profit. In this regard, the aim of this article is to identify the key drivers of intra- and inter-temporal effort allocation in a multi-species trawl fishery consisting of 61 Norwegian trawl vessels targeting cod, saithe, and haddock, the aim being to maximize the fishing profit within the quota constraints. We adopted a two-step Heckman estimator that incorporates the relative attractiveness of three heavily trawled areas, the southern and northern parts of the west coast of Norway and the high sea areas of the Arctic. The relative attractiveness is specified by the fish availability, measured using the catch per unit of effort, prices of the target species, fuel cost, intensity of the coastal fleet's participation in winter fishery, and seasonal sea ice extent in the Barents Sea during the period 2011-2016. Our results show that region-specific attributes and spatial margins have a profound impact on the intra-temporal and inter-temporal allocation of fishing effort to maximize the seasonal profit. Furthermore, we found evidence of economically rational behaviour of the Norwegian trawlers in constantly reallocating their fishing effort in response to the changes in the relative attractiveness of the selected fishing areas over the course of a fishing year.;"[Ashrafi, Tannaz Alizadeh] Arctic Univ Norway UiT, Norwegian Coll Fishery Sci, N-9019 Tromso, Norway; [Abe, Keita] Norwegian Sch Econ NHH, Dept Econ, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway";;Ashrafi, TA (corresponding author), Arctic Univ Norway UiT, Norwegian Coll Fishery Sci, N-9019 Tromso, Norway.;tannaz.alizadeh@uit.no;;;;;43;0;0;0;0;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;1054-3139;1095-9289;ICES J MAR SCI;ICES J.

The biological submodel was parameterized with age-structured population parameters for the five target stocks in the WM MAP (European hake, red mullet, deep-water rose shrimp, Nephrops and red shrimp) with a sixth stock combining the remaining commercial by catch and following a biomass dynamics model. The trawl fleet was composed of three fleet segments, according to Vessel Length class (VL1218, VL1824, VL2440), practicing two metiers: coastal mixed demersal fishery and deep-water crustacean fishery. The technological solutions analyzed are two simple technical modifications to the otter bottom trawl and based on i) using a panel of meshes turned 90 degrees (T90) in the extension of the trawl net, and ii) inserting a selective grid built from 40 mm square mesh (SM40) netting into the extension of the trawl net. The Results show that, in terms of policy objectives, the reduction in the values of fishing mortality achieved with these selectivity modifications would be insufficient to reach the target fishing mortality at maximum sustainable yield (Fmsy) prescribed in the WM MAP by 2025. However, model results project a substantial recovery of hake and red mullet stock biomass. The recovery of these two important stocks would help improve the evolution of the economic indicators, resulting generally in higher income, profits and salaries in the short (2025) and mid term (2030).;"[Maynou, Francesc; Garcia-de-Vinuesa, Alfredo; Sanchez, Pilar; Demestre, Montserrat] CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, Psg Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, Barcelona 08003, Spain";;Maynou, F (corresponding author), CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, Psg Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, Barcelona 08003, Spain.;maynouf@icm.csic.es;Maynou, Francesc/A-6433-2011;Maynou, Francesc/0000-0001-7200-6485;"Spanish Scientific Research Council; Spanish Ministry for Science and InnovationSpanish Government [RTI2018-095770-B-I00]; Adessium Foundation [351/2018/9E204550/AD17-39-44]; Spanish government through the 'Severo Ochoa Centre of Excel-lence' accreditation [CEX2019-000928-S]; Mediterranean Marine Initiative of WWF";"The authors declare the following financial interests/personal re-lationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Francesc Maynou reports financial support, administrative support, and article publishing charges were provided by Spanish Scientific Research Council.; Funding was provided by the research projects CriMa (Spanish Ministry for Science and Innovation, RTI2018-095770-B-I00) and theMediterranean Marine Initiative of WWF and the Adessium Foundation (contract no: 351/2018/9E204550/AD17-39-44) .

Such events typically increase the risk of stranding. Rescue Centers offer a unique opportunity to report animals in distress and satellite track rehabilitated individuals to identify potential new habitats and support an effective conservation of these endangered species. By combining sightings (1988-2020) and tracking data (2008-2020) collected along the French Atlantic and English Channel coasts, our study assessed if the Bay of Biscay is an ecological trap or a favorable habitat for immature sea turtles. The largest tracked individuals migrated westward to pelagic waters, likely toward their natal beaches, while smaller individuals remained within the Bay of Biscay (BoB) and crossed colder (mean: 17.8 +/- 3.0 degrees C) but more productive waters. The turtles' directions differed from the ones of ocean currents, excluding a passive advection to these unexpected habitats. Although the BoB might be thermally unsuitable in winter, the higher micronekton biomass predicted in this region could offer a productive foraging habitat for immature turtles. However, the majority of the sightings referred to individuals stranded alive (75%), suggesting this area could also act as an ecological trap for the smallest individuals that are mostly reported in winter suffering cold-stunning. Assumed to be outside the species range, our results reveal a potential foraging ground in the North-East Atlantic for these young turtles, confirming the crucial role of the rehabilitation centers and the need to continue prioritizing conservation of these endangered species, particularly vulnerable at this stage and at such temperate latitudes.</p>;"[Chambault, Philippine; Dell'Amico, Florence] Ctr Etud & Soins Tortues Marines, Aquarium La Rochelle, La Rochelle, France; [Gaspar, Philippe] MERCATOR Ocean Int MOI, Toulouse, France";;Chambault, P (corresponding author), Ctr Etud & Soins Tortues Marines, Aquarium La Rochelle, La Rochelle, France.;Philippine.Chambault@gmail.com;;;;;100;0;0;2;2;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND;;2296-7745;FRONT MAR SCI;Front.

Among the most biologically diverse but SLR-threatened coastal ecosystems are rocky shores, especially in regions with a small tidal range. Nonetheless, the impacts of SLR on rocky shore biodiversity, community structure and ecosystem functions have rarely been studied. Here, we use the biogenic intertidal ecosystem, Mediterranean vermetid reefs on the Israeli coast, as case study for testing the potential impact of SLR on reef communities, with surveys, 3D topographic mapping plus SLR simulations, and a manipulative community translocation experiment. We show that: (1) biodiversity is much lower on very shallow, permanently submerged, horizontal rocky surfaces compared to that on intertidal reef platforms, (2) the extensive intertidal platforms will permanently drown under even modest SLR scenarios, (3) the rich intertidal community will transform, when permanently submerged, either to a very different but still rich community when protected from grazing by highly abundant invasive fish (rabbitfish), or to a much poorer turf community when exposed to such fish grazing, and (4) the reef community net production will drastically drop under permanent submersion. Because the main ecosystem engineer of the vermetid reefs, Dendropoma anguliferum (Monterosato, 1878), is nearly extinct in the southeast Levant, it is unlikely that new reefs will be formed higher on the shore in the future, presumably resulting in extensive coastal ecological shifts. Considerable coastal community shifts are forecasted for many regions globally due to SLR, as many shorelines are predicted to suffer from coastal squeeze. Hence, similar manipulative experiments are encouraged in other regions to test for generality vs. context dependency in SLR ecological impacts. We suggest that in cases where essential/unique intertidal habitats like vermetid reefs are expected to vanish by SLR, constructing carefully-planned, ecologically friendly, artificial alternatives should be considered .

Approaches using multiple traits are being developed, but their generic relevance across faunal components and geographic locations remains poorly tested, and the importance of confounding effects are poorly recognised. This study integrates biological traits of benthic species that are responsive to instantaneous effects of trawling (i.e. sensitivity) and traits expressing recoverability over the longer term (i.e. years). We highlight the functional independence between these 2 components in response to trawling, test the behaviours of single and combined traits and account for potential confounding effects of environment and trawling intensity on benthic communities through variation partitioning. Two case studies are considered: epibenthos from the Bay of Biscay and endobenthos of the Dutch sector of the North Sea. The response to trawling is most pronounced when multiple traits covering different aspects that determine population dynamics (i.e. sensitivity and recoverability) are combined, despite confounding effects between gradients of benthic production and trawling intensity, especially for endobenthos. The integration of traits reflecting both sensitivity and recoverability provides complementary information on the faunal response to trawling, bridging the gap between fishing impact assessments and benthic community status assessments.;"[Beauchard, Olivier] Nelherlands Inst Sea Res, Korringaweg 7,POB 140, NL-4401 NT Yerseke, Netherlands; [Beauchard, Olivier] Univ Utrecht, Dept Estuarine & Delta Syst, Korringaweg 7,POB 140, NL-4401 NT Yerseke, Netherlands; [Beauchard, Olivier] Univ Antwerp, Ecosyst Management Res Grp, Univ Pl 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Brind'Amour, Anik; Laffargue, Pascal] IFREMER, Unite Ecol & Modeles Halieut, Rue Ile dYeu,BP 21105, F-44311 Nantes 3, France; [Schratzberger, Michaela] Lowestoft Lab, Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Pakefield Rd, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England; [Hintzen, Niels T.; Piet, Gerjan] Wageningen UR, Wageningen Marine Res, NL-1970 AB Ijmuiden, Netherlands; [Somerfield, Paul J.] Plymouth Marine Lab, Prospect Pl, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England";;"Beauchard, O (corresponding author), Nelherlands Inst Sea Res, Korringaweg 7,POB 140, NL-4401 NT Yerseke, Netherlands.; Beauchard, O (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Dept Estuarine & Delta Syst, Korringaweg 7,POB 140, NL-4401 NT Yerseke, Netherlands.; Beauchard, O (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Ecosyst Management Res Grp, Univ Pl 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium.";olivier.beauchard@nioz.nl;;Laffargue, Pascal/0000-0003-2126-9773;"Gieskes Strijbis Fonds, DISCLOSE project; UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural AffairsDepartment for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) [SLA44, NE/L003279/1]; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); UK Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/L003279/1, NE/R015953/1]; Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality [BO-43-021.02-002]";"O.B. acknowledges funding from the Gieskes Strijbis Fonds as part of the DISCLOSE project (https://discloseweb.webhosting.rug.nl/).

As part of purse seine fishing for small pelagic fish in northern European waters, excess and/or unwanted catches are routinely released fromthe net in aprocess called slipping. Due to excessive crowding in the net prior to release, post-slipping mortality rates can be unacceptably high. Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) support large and economically important purse seine fisheries but are known to be particularly vulnerable to such crowding-induced mortality. Developing management advice to promote post-slipping survival for this species is currently challenging, due to a lack of understanding of how crowding influences their physiology. Here we examine the physiological response, recovery and survival of wild caught mackerel exposed to various degrees and durations of simulated crowding stress in a series of sea cage trials. The magnitude of the physiological response and its time to recovery was positively correlated with crowding density and duration andwas characterized by cortisol elevation, energy mobilization and anaerobic metabolite accumulation. There were also indications of osmoregulatory disturbance. Skin injury and mortality rates showed a similar positive relationship to crowding density. The physiological disturbance was recoverable for most fish. Instead, the rate at which mortalities developed and the physiological profile of moribund fish indicated that skin injury, likely arising from abrasive contact with netting and other fish during crowding, was the probable cause of mortality. Injured fish also exhibited a loss of allometric condition relative to non-injured survivors. Crowding treatments were potentially confounded by differences in ambient oxygen reduction, water temperature and pre-treatment fish condition between trials, and densities were replicated only once. These results contribute to the development of welfare conscious fishing practices that aim to reduce post-slipping mortality.;"[Anders, Neil; Breen, Mike] Inst Marine Res IMR, Fish Capture Div, N-5817 Bergen, Norway; [Roth, Bjorn] NOFIMA, Dept Proc Technol, N-4068 Stavanger, Norway";;Anders, N (corresponding author), Inst Marine Res IMR, Fish Capture Div, N-5817 Bergen, Norway.;neil.anders@hi.no;;;Norwegian Seafood Research Fund (Fiskeri-og Havbruksnaeringens Forskningsfond) [901350];This work was supported by the Norwegian Seafood Research Fund (Fiskeri-og Havbruksnaeringens Forskningsfond, Project No. 901350).;78;0;0;4;4;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;2051-1434;;CONSERV PHYSIOL;Conserv.

The present work analyzes data from 22 bottom trawls, carried out in parallel by two commercial trawlers between 70 and 90 m depth on mae center dot rl beds off eastern Menorca (Balearic Islands). One vessel used an experimental trawl gear (EXP) equipped with a lighter and smaller groundrope in the mouth of the net, leaving a gap without net between the main groundrope and the secondary one. The other vessel used a trawl gear traditionally used by the fleet operating in the area (TRA), without that modification. Catches, discards and commercial yields between both gears were compared. Discarded biomass of non-commercial benthic species with EXP was reduced by half when compared to TRA, particularly for rhodoliths (54%) and ascidians (51%). The reduction of discarded rhodoliths is especially relevant in the Balearic Islands where sensitive habitats, such as mae center dot rl beds, are an important part of the benthic communities. The modification of the net, at the same time, does not imply a reduction of yields of commercial captures and can easily be implemented in any bottom trawl net. It is concluded that this could be an appropriate and plausible technical measure to improve the ecological efficiency and the sustainability of the Mediterranean bottom trawl fishery.;"[Farriols, M.

The adoption of alternative fishing gears is an appealing solution to ensure a more sustainable exploitation of resources. We discuss the pros and cons of pots as alternative gears by reviewing their main designs, spatial distribution and target species in the Mediterranean basin. We assessed the technical factors affecting the catch efficiency of the different pot designs for four target species: spiny lobster, Palinurus elephas; Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus; common octopus, Octopus vulgaris and pandalid shrimps, Plesionika spp. We found that pot volume is important to catch Octopus; mesh size to catch Nephrops and Plesionika; entrance surface to catch Octopus, Nephrops and Plesionika; pot shape/colour and entrance shape/position to catch Octopus and Plesionika; and bait type to catch Octopus and Nephrops. The literature review shows that pot fisheries have several considerable advantages over conventional gears, especially in terms of discards, bycatch, seabed impacts (particularly compared with bottom trawls and passive set nets), size and species selectivity, gear depredation, catch quality and gear cost, besides saving time and labour. Disadvantages hampering their wider diffusion include ghost fishing, a low catch of finfish species, the narrow range of species targeted by each pot design and the current early stage of research. These data make a clear case for using pots as alternative gears to traditional ones in the Mediterranean Sea in some areas and seasons to catch certain target species.";"[Petetta, Andrea] Univ Bologna UNIBO, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci BIGEA, Bologna, Italy; [Petetta, Andrea; Virgili, Massimo; Guicciardi, Stefano; Lucchetti, Alessandro] Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Biol Resources & Marine Biotechnol IRBIM, Ancona, Italy";;"Petetta, A (corresponding author), Univ Bologna UNIBO, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci BIGEA, Bologna, Italy.; Petetta, A (corresponding author), Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Biol Resources & Marine Biotechnol IRBIM, Ancona, Italy.";andrea.petetta@irbim.cnr.it;;Petetta, Andrea/0000-0003-1976-8995;LIFE Financial Instrument of the European Community, Life Delfi Project - Dolphin Experience: Lowering Fishing Interactions [LIFE18NAT/IT/000942];This study was conducted with the contribution of the LIFE Financial Instrument of the European Community, Life Delfi Project - Dolphin Experience: Lowering Fishing Interactions (LIFE18NAT/IT/000942).;148;1;1;5;5;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0960-3166;1573-5184;REV FISH BIOL FISHER;Rev.

Although an ecosystem approach to fisheries management aims to conserve marine biodiversity and ecosystem function, there remains a lack of empirical evidence regarding the effects of trawling on benthic functional properties. Here, we examined the sensitivity of benthic macrofauna communities to trawling using their biological traits, and compared trait responses across size-categories and survey types. We collected 84 benthic soft-sediment samples by Van Veen grab (0.1 m(2)) in the Kattegat in 2016, complemented with 827 Haps cores (0.0143 m(2)) gathered over a long-term monitoring programme between 2006 and 2013. By analysing trait response in 3 size categories (small: 1-4 mm fraction; large: >= 4 mm fraction; full community: all individuals combined), we demonstrate a size-dependent effect of trawling on benthic trait composition, where the traits of large-bodied fauna (>= 4 mm) were more sensitive. Specifically, larger sessile, deep-living, suspension-feeding, tube-dwelling, subsurface deposit-feeding, burrow-dwelling, and long-lived (>= 10 yr) individuals were among the most affected. Our results based on large fauna were largely in agreement with trait responses observed in the multi-year monitoring data, suggesting that trait data gathered from a targeted one-time sampling event can convey information on both acute (short-term) and chronic (long-term) trawling impacts. Given that most trawling impact assessments do not consider size-based effects, we outline how size-separating the community can be used to improve the detectability of trawling impacts, and provide new insights into the functional impacts of fishing on the seabed.";"[McLaverty, Ciaran; Dinesen, Grete E.; Gislason, Henrik; Brooks, Mollie E.; Eigaard, Ole R.] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, DTU Aqua, Kemitorvet, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark";;McLaverty, C (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, DTU Aqua, Kemitorvet, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.;cimc@aqua.dtu.dk;Brooks, Mollie Elizabeth/AAM-5509-2021;"Brooks, Mollie Elizabeth/0000-0001-6963-8326; Eigaard, Ole Ritzau/0000-0003-4213-2397; Dinesen, Grete E./0000-0002-6385-1238";"Danish Fisheries Agency; Ministry of Environment and Food of Denmark; European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) [33113-B16-024, 33113-B-17-107]; DTU Aqua";We thank the captains and crew of the RV 'Havfisken' and the DTU Aqua laboratory technicians and students for assistance in sediment analysis, biomass estimation, and sorting benthic samples.

However, although genetics can reveal mismatches between biological and management units and other relevant but hidden information such as species misidentification or hybridization, the uptake of genetic methods by the fisheries management process is far from having been consolidated. Here, we have assessed the power of genetics to better understand the population connectivity of white (Lophius piscatorius) and its interaction with its sister species, the black anglerfish (Lophius budegassa). Our analyses, based on thousands of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms, show three findings that are crucial for white anglerfish management. We found (i) that white anglerfish is likely composed of a single panmictic population throughout the Northeast Atlantic, challenging the three-stock based management, (ii) that a fraction of specimens classified as white anglerfish using morphological characteristics are genetically identified as black anglerfish (L. budegassa), and iii) that the two Lophius species naturally hybridize leading to a population of hybrids of up to 20% in certain areas. Our results set the basics for a genetics-informed white anglerfish assessment framework that accounts for stock connectivity, revises and establishes new diagnostic characters for Lophius species identification, and evaluates the effect of hybrids in the current and future assessments of the white anglerfish. Furthermore, our study contributes to provide additional evidence of the potentially negative consequences of ignoring genetic data for assessing fisheries resources.;"[Aguirre-Sarabia, Imanol; Diaz-Arce, Natalia; Pereda-Agirre, Iker; Mendibil, Inaki; Urtizberea, Agurtzane; Quinconces, Inaki; Santurtun, Marina; Rodriguez-Ezpeleta, Naiara] AZTI Basque Res & Technol Alliance BRTA, Marine Res, Sukarrieta, Bizkaia, Spain; [Gerritsen, Hans D.] Marine Inst, Fisheries Ecosyst Advisory Serv, Galway, Ireland; [Burns, Finlay] Marine Scotland Sci, Marine Lab, Aberdeen, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Holmes, Ian] Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Lowestoft Lab, Lowestoft, Suffolk, England; [Landa, Jorge] Inst Espanol Oceanog IEO, Ctr Oceanog Santander, Santander, Spain; [Coscia, Ilaria] Univ Salford, Sch Sci Engn & Environm, Salford, Lancs, England; [Zanzi, Antonella; Martinsohn, Jann T.] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr JRC, Ispra, Italy";;Rodriguez-Ezpeleta, N (corresponding author), AZTI, Basque Res & Technol Alliance BRTA, Marine Res, Txatxarramendi Ugartea Z-G, Sukarrieta 48395, Bizkaia, Spain.;nrodriguez@azti.es;"Rodriguez-Ezpeleta, Naiara/B-7138-2014; Diaz-Arce, Natalia/AAY-8593-2021";"Rodriguez-Ezpeleta, Naiara/0000-0001-6735-6755; Diaz-Arce, Natalia/0000-0003-3196-4737; Quincoces, Inaki/0000-0003-4177-5497; Zanzi, Antonella/0000-0002-3567-9709";"Joint Research Centre [JRC/IPR/2017/D.2/0016/NC]; Department of Education (Basque Government)Basque Government; Department of Environment, Planning, Agriculture and Fisheries (Basque Government)";"Joint Research Centre, Grant/Award Number: Contract JRC/IPR/2017/D.2/0016/NC; Department of Education (Basque Government), Grant/Award Number: Predoctoral grant; Department of Environment, Planning, Agriculture and Fisheries (Basque Government), Grant/Award Number: GENGES";64;0;0;4;4;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1752-4571;;EVOL APPL;Evol.

One of the direct physical impacts is the mobilization of sediment in the wake of trawl gear components that are in contact with or are close to the seabed. The quantity of sediment mobilized is related to the hydrodynamic drag of the gear components and the type of sediment over which they are trawled. Here we present a methodology to estimate the sediment mobilization from hydrodynamic drag. The hydrodynamic drag of individual gear components is estimated using empirical measurements of similarly shaped objects, including cylinders, cubes, and nets. The method is applied to beam trawls used in the Dutch North Sea flatfish fishery and validated using measurements of beam trawl drag from the literature. Netting contributes most to the hydrodynamic drag of pulse trawls, while the tickler chains and chain mat comprise most of the hydrodynamic drag of conventional beam trawls. Taking account of the silt content of the areas trawled and the number of different beam trawl types used by the fleet, sediment mobilization is estimated as 9.2 and 5.3 kg m(-2) for conventional 12 m beam and pulse trawls, respectively, and 4.2 and 4.3 kg m(-2) for conventional 4.5 m beam and pulse trawls.;"[Rijnsdorp, A.

The benthic data collected by scientific trawl surveys in all European waters, in the frame of the Common Fishery Policy Data Collection Multiannual Program, can be used to study the impact of large-scale fisheries such as trawling. However, the catchability of trawls is very dependent on the nature of the seabed as well as resulting ground-gear adaptations. Due to its non-destructive nature and its ability to focus on benthic macro-epifauna, towed video sampling appears to be a good alternative to monitor the impact of trawling on benthic communities. In the present work, we studied the influence of fishery induced seabed abrasion and video characteristics on nine indices, which can be used to monitor the effect of trawling on benthic communities, was studied. Among them, three indices specific to fishery effect detection based on biological traits appeared to be the best performing benthic indices with video data: modified-Trawling Disturbance Index, partial-Trawling Disturbance Index, and modified sensitivity index. The effectiveness of these indices to monitor the effect of trawling was evaluated and compared between trawl and video sampling. This work has highlighted that video sampling could be a good alternative, or at least a complementary method, to scientific trawling to monitor the effect of trawling on benthic communities in European waters.;"[Jac, Cyrielle; Vaz, Sandrine] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, IRD, Sete,Ifremer,MARBEC, Montpellier, France; [Desroy, Nicolas; Foveau, Aurelie] IFREMER, Lab Environm & Ressource Bretagne Nord, F-35800 Dinard, France; [Duchene, Jean-Claude] Univ Bordeaux 1, CNRS, UMR 5805 EPOC, Stn Marine Arcachon, 2 Rue Pr Jolyet, F-33120 Arcachon, France; [Labrune, Celine; Lescure, Lyvia] Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, Lab Ecogeochim Environm Benth, LECOB UMR 8222, F-66650 Banyuls Sur Mer, France";;Jac, C (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, CNRS, IRD, Sete,Ifremer,MARBEC, Montpellier, France.;cyrielle.jac@ifremer.fr;;"Nicolas, Desroy/0000-0002-9047-5637; Vaz, Sandrine/0000-0002-7365-8335; Foveau, Aurelie/0000-0001-6283-2214; JAC, Cyrielle/0000-0003-1567-2072";"EC2CO National Program on Coastal Environments (Bentchal); DG ENV project IDEM (Implementation of the MSFD to the Deep Mediterranean Sea) [11.0661/2017/750680/SUB/EN V.C]; National Research Agency under the program Investissements d'AvenirFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-10-IEED-0006-25]; Occitanie region through its PhD research funding program";"This study was supported by the EC2CO National Program on Coastal Environments (Bentchal), the DG ENV project IDEM (Implementation of the MSFD to the Deep Mediterranean Sea; contract EU No 11.0661/2017/750680/SUB/EN V.C2) and French State Funding managed by France Energies Marines and the National Research Agency under the program Investissements d'Avenir (ANR-10-IEED-0006-25).

Nevertheless, little research has been conducted on its spatio-temporal dimensions. This study extends the knowledge about marine angling tourism by investigating activity hot spots and travel distances of 8429 German Baltic Sea anglers using data obtained from an on-site survey which was conducted from 2015 to 2019. Fishing from shores, small boats, and charter vessels, the anglers targeted primarily Atlantic cod and to a lesser extent sea trout, salmon, and herring. Angling effort clustered along the coast primarily according to the available infrastructure and the spatial distribution of the target species. The medians of travel distances differed among the target species and decreased from salmon (261 km), cod (194 km), sea trout (63 km) to herring (44 km). The high percentage of non-resident anglers, most of whom travelled more than 200 km to the coast, suggested that particularly cod and salmonid anglers conducted multiple-day trips and contributed to local economies. The period 2016/17 was characterised by a severe decline of the western Baltic cod stock and the first-time implementation of harvest limitations. The number and travel distances of cod charter vessel anglers decreased after the implementation, whereas the numbers and travel distances of boat and shore anglers targeting cod remained constant despite overall decreasing catch rates. The delineation of areas where marine recreational fishing concentrates may help to define areas relevant for tourism development and destination branding and equally those that require a risk assessment to evaluate the potential extent and consequences of MRF on local environments. The travel distances underlined the heterogeneity of the MRF and may be used as tool to identify stakeholder groups, to estimate the species-specific attractiveness for resident and non-resident anglers, and to evaluate the outcome of management actions.;"[Lewin, W. -C.; Weltersbach, M.

Damage was assessed by quantifying shell and foot damage on commercial clams caught with mechanical dredges. Survival experiments were carried out to assess their survival capacity after 24h purification treatment and 72h cold storage, which represents an issue of great interest for fisheries research, management and marketing. Overall, 2.4% of wedge clams suffered any type of damage, including chipped edges and scratched valves. Higher proportions of shell-damaged individuals were positively correlated to bottom features (e.g. gravel content in sediment). Moreover, higher towing speed significantly increased shell damage. Analyses of shell damage areas revealed that the anterior dorsal and ventral parts of the shell are the most vulnerable to dredging. A total of 15.9% of individuals showed damage on the foot, which seems not to affect their survival. The incidence of foot damage was mostly linked to sublethal predation, reflected in a positive correlation between the proportion of foot-damaged individuals and biomass of decapod crustaceans in the fishing ground. Finally, D. trunculus exhibited very low mortality rates after 24h purification treatment (0.2-0.4%) and 72h cold storage (0.3-3.2%). The survival rate at the end of the experiment was high (>96%), with the highest mortality observed 96h after the fishing day.

However, the ability of marine managers to assess, monitor and mitigate impacts to sea pens at national scales has been constrained by a limited understanding of their environmental requirements, geographical distribution and responses to trawling. In this study, we used random forest species distribution modelling (SDM) to predict the distribution of suitable habitat for 3 sea pen species (tall sea pen Funiculina quadrangularis, slender sea pen Virgularia mirabilis and phosphorescent sea pen Pennatula phosphorea) on the UK continental shelf, exploring the results relative to the distribution of fishing activity. Occurrence of all 3 species corresponded to areas of low current and wave velocity, where suspended matter in the water column was also low. However, for F. quadrangularis, the largest species, the models indicated substantially different drivers of distribution between the Greater North Sea and Celtic Seas ICES Ecoregions. This disparity appears to reflect modification to the range and realised niche of this species in the Greater North Sea, due to trawling impacts. P. phosphorea and V. mirabilis appear to be more resilient to trawling, with no clear negative relationships observed. Our findings illustrate the value of broadscale qualitative comparisons between SDMs and human activity data for insights on pressure-state relationships. When combined with robust distribution maps, this improved understanding of vulnerability will enable marine managers to make ecologically sound, defensible decisions and deliver tangible conservation outcomes for sea pen communities.;"[Downie, Anna-Leena; Noble-James, Tamsyn; Chaverra, Ana] Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Pakefield Rd, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England; [Chaverra, Ana; Howell, Kerry L.] Plymouth Univ, Marine Biol & Ecol Res Ctr, Marine Inst, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England";;Downie, AL (corresponding author), Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Pakefield Rd, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England.;anna.downie@cefas.co.uk;;Howell, Kerry/0000-0003-3359-1778;;;86;1;1;2;2;INTER-RESEARCH;OLDENDORF LUHE;NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY;0171-8630;1616-1599;MAR ECOL PROG SER;Mar.

Sensitivity to fishing increases along a fast-to-slow gradient of life history strategies, and the slow species (large, long-lived, late-maturing, giving birth to few large offspring) require the most time to recover from fishing. In the North East Atlantic, after having reached extreme levels, fishing pressure has decreased since the 1980's due to management measures such as total allowable catch (TAC) or area closure. An effect on the distribution of species as well as a potential recovery could be expected. However, temporal patterns of life history strategies are rarely linked to management measures. In addition, a larger emphasis is often put on exploited or emblematic sensitive species but rarely on assembly processes at the ecosystem scale (both commercial and non-commercial species). Based on a 17-year time series of 101 taxa (fishes, elasmobranchs, bivalves, cephalopods and crustaceans), we observed a negative relationship between the biomass of taxa sensitive to fishing and bottom trawling pressure, as well as an increase in their total biomass in the Celtic Sea. Over the whole area, stochasticity appeared as the dominant assembly process. Deterministic assembly processes were at play in the centre of the area where significant overdispersion (caused by the presence of both slow and fast taxa) were observed. The absence of sensitive taxa from the rest of the Celtic Sea appeared to be caused mainly by a historical effect of environmental filtering when fishing was high. At the local scale, we related the decrease in fishing pressure to the increase in biomass of five of the most sensitive taxa. This local decrease in fishing pressure, resulting from the implementation of an area closure, highlights the positive effect of such management measures in less than two decades.;"[Merillet, Laurene; Pavoine, Sandrine; Mouchet, Maud] UPMC, CNRS, MNHN, Ctr Ecol & Sci COnservat,UMR 7204, 43 Rue Buffon,CP135, F-75005 Paris, France; [Merillet, Laurene; Kopp, Dorothee; Robert, Marianne] IFREMER, Unite Sci & Technol Halieut, Lab Technol & Biol Halieut, 8 Rue Francois Toullec, F-56100 Lorient, France; [Merillet, Laurene] Inst Marine Res Havforskningsinst, Ecosyst Proc Team, Nordnesgaten 33, N-5005 Bergen, Norway";;Merillet, L (corresponding author), UPMC, CNRS, MNHN, Ctr Ecol & Sci COnservat,UMR 7204, 43 Rue Buffon,CP135, F-75005 Paris, France.;laurene.merillet@gmail.com;Robert, Marianne/V-6221-2018;"Robert, Marianne/0000-0002-4727-5509; Kopp, Dorothee/0000-0002-8767-2736; Pavoine, Sandrine/0000-0003-2767-6484";"French Institute for the Exploitation of the Sea (IFREMER); National Museum of Natural History (MNHN)";We thank all those who made data sampling possible during the EVHOE surveys.

Therefore, it is of great importance to characterize the impacts of bottom trawling on bentho-demersal communities, which can be done through the study of indicators sensitive to trawling pressure. Using a functional indicator applied to 54 underwater video transects, we mapped the sensitivity to trawling of epibenthic invertebrates and fish communities in the Celtic Sea. We determined the relative influence of environmental and fishing variables on sensitivity and traits distribution. Our results suggest that community sensitivity to trawling is mainly driven by a spatial gradient of depth and primary productivity that separates the area into two main regions: a shallow, productive area, with low sensitivity and a higher abundance of swimming and crawling organisms, and a deeper, less productive area, with higher sensitivity due to a higher abundance of fixed, filter-feeding organisms. Fishing intensity also drives the sensitivity of communities confirming that they have already been shaped by a long history of mixed fisheries. The methodology used here provides a valuable monitoring tool and could be used to predict communities' response to changes in fishing intensity and climate change.;"[Dupaix, Amael; Merillet, Laurene; Kopp, Dorothee; Robert, Marianne] IFREMER, Lab Technol & Biol Halieut, STH Unite Sci & Technol Halieut, F-56100 Lorient, France; [Dupaix, Amael] ENS Lyon, Dept Biol, 46 Allee Italie, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Merillet, Laurene; Mouchet, Maud] MNHN SU CNRS, Ctr Ecol & Sci COnservat, UMR 7204, 43 Rue Buffon,CP135, F-75005 Paris, France";;"Dupaix, A (corresponding author), IFREMER, Lab Technol & Biol Halieut, STH Unite Sci & Technol Halieut, F-56100 Lorient, France.; Dupaix, A (corresponding author), ENS Lyon, Dept Biol, 46 Allee Italie, F-69007 Lyon, France.";amael.dupaix@ens-lyon.fr;Robert, Marianne/V-6221-2018;"Robert, Marianne/0000-0002-4727-5509; Kopp, Dorothee/0000-0002-8767-2736";;;69;0;0;0;0;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;1054-3139;1095-9289;ICES J MAR SCI;ICES J.

Sediment cores were taken on the track and compared to undisturbed controls. Benthic fluxes were immediately affected and an upward shift in pore water DIC profiles was detected. The time needed for the sediment to readjust to a new biogeochemical state seemed to be nutrient-specific. Sediment properties (profiles of chlorophyll, organic carbon and water content) were found to change significantly. Macrofauna was removed completely by the dredge pointing out the potential loss of highly valuable functions that are associated with them. In the Baltic Sea, in areas which were previously the most heavily fished, the frequency of trawling may have left little time for readjustment and potentially kept the seabed in a permanent state of transient biogeochemical cycling.;"[Morys, Claudia; Bradshaw, Clare] Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, Svante Arrhenius Vag 20 A, S-11418 Stockholm, Sweden; [Bruchert, Volker] Stockholm Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Svante Arrhenius Vag 8 C, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden";;Morys, C (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, Svante Arrhenius Vag 20 A, S-11418 Stockholm, Sweden.;"Claudia.Morys@su.se; Volker.Bruchert@geo.su.se; Clare.Bradshaw@su.se";;;Swedish Research Council FormasSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas [2017-00866];This study was funded by the Swedish Research Council Formas (grant number: 2017-00866) .

Studies of catch profiles of target and bycatch species for different fleets and metiers are necessary for successful management of target species. Such studies are also needed for the assessment of the interactions and evaluation of the impact on the ecosystems. This paper presents a study of the Spanish purse-seine fleet operating in the Bay of Biscay during the years 2016?2019. It considers the species selectivity and the effect of fishing activities on the pelagic community by assessing the interactions with the endangered, threatened and protected (ETP) species and estimating the discard sizes. For the purpose of this study, the metiers were defined by grouping similar catch profiles, using hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis. This definition of metier goes beyond the Data Collection Framework (DCF) concepts; it includes specific target species, thus increasing the accuracy. Sampling conducted at sea during the four years of the study demonstrated that; 1) the discards were scarce both in terms of overall values and the proportion of the catch (below 1% for almost all metiers and years); 2) The studied purse-seine fishery is one of the most selective among those harvesting the pelagic domain in the Bay of Biscay; 3) The results also showed that the fleet avoided the unwanted catches, mostly by practising slipping;4) The interaction with the ETPs was almost non-existent. Only a single case of a yellow-legged gull entanglement was recorded, and the bird was released alive. Notably, more than 7500 individuals of 16 species of seabirds and marine mammals were recorded in the vicinity of the fishing grounds. Thus, we conclude that this purse-seine fishery has only a slight impact on the main species of the pelagic ecosystem, due to the purse-seine slipping practices.";"[Ruiz, Jon; Louzao, Maite; Oyarzabal, Inaki; Arregi, Luis; Mugerza, Estanis; Uriarte, Andres] Basque Res & Technol Alliance BRTA, Sustainable Fisheries Management, AZTI, Sukarrieta 48395, Bizkaia, Spain";;Ruiz, J (corresponding author), Basque Res & Technol Alliance BRTA, Sustainable Fisheries Management, AZTI, Sukarrieta 48395, Bizkaia, Spain.;jruiz@azti.es;;"Ruiz, Jon/0000-0003-0717-0136; Mugerza, Estanis/0000-0003-4175-8750";"European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMMF), as part of the European Regulation for the Fishery data Collection (Data Collection Framework Council Regulation (EC)) [199/2008]; European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMMF), as part of the European Regulation for the Fishery data Collection (Data Collection Framework Council Regulation (EU)) [2017/1004]; Basque Country -OPEGUI-; Asturias -CERCOASTUR-; Ramon y Cajal postdoctoral contract (Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion) [RYC-2012-09897]";The observer programme has been partially funded through de European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMMF), as part of the European Regulation for the Fishery data Collection (Data Collection Framework Council Regulation (EC) No. 199/2008, and Regulation (EU) 2017/1004).

Species that are caught almost exclusively by this gear, either as target (such as Pectinidae) or accessory catches (such as flatfishes apart from the common sole), remain unassessed mainly due to the lack of data and biological information. Based on cluster analysis, the catch assemblage of this fishery was identified and assessed using CMSY model. The results of this data-poor methodology showed that, among the species analyzed, no one is sustainably exploited. The single-species CMSY results were used as input to an extension of the same model, to test the effect of four different harvest control rule (HCR) scenarios on the entire catch assemblage, through 15-years forecasts. The analysis showed that the percentage of the stocks that will reach Bmsy at the end of the projections will depend on the HCR applied. Forecasts showed that a reduction of 20% of fishing effort may permit to most of the target and accessory species of the rapido trawl fishery in the Adriatic Sea to recover to Bmsy levels within 15 years, also providing a slight increase in the expected catches.;"[Armelloni, Enrico Nicola; Scanu, Martina; Masnadi, Francesco; Angelini, Silvia; Scarcella, Giuseppe] Univ Bologna, Alma Mater Studiorum, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci BiGeA, Bologna, Italy; [Armelloni, Enrico Nicola; Scanu, Martina; Masnadi, Francesco] Natl Res Council IRBIM CNR, Inst Marine Biol Resources & Biotechnol, Ancona, Italy; [Coro, Gianpaolo] Natl Res Council Italy ISTI CNR, Inst Informat Sci & Technol A Faedo, Pisa, Italy";;"Scanu, M (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, Alma Mater Studiorum, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci BiGeA, Bologna, Italy.; Scanu, M (corresponding author), Natl Res Council IRBIM CNR, Inst Marine Biol Resources & Biotechnol, Ancona, Italy.";martina.scanu@irbim.cnr.it;;"Armelloni, Enrico Nicola/0000-0002-6679-1912; Scanu, Martina/0000-0002-3212-7378; Masnadi, Francesco/0000-0003-0673-178X";DRuMFISH project [EASME/EMFF/2014/.1.3.2.4/SI2.721116];FM, MS, and EA thank those who contribute to their training with specific courses.

For this purpose, data were obtained through face-to-face interviews with 19 vessels randomly selected among 82 fishing vessels during the period. Variables used for technical inefficiency (ui) were determined as professional trawling experience, the total crew, pelagic trawling subsidy rates, and the use of pelagic trawling credits. It was used the FRONTIER 4.1. for Stochastic efficiency frontier calculations developed by Coelli (2007). As a result of the study, it was revealed that an improvement of 26% was required for trawlers to become efficient. Technical efficiency in the sampled vessels ranged from 0.413 to 0.998, with an average of 0.739. According to the results, it was concluded that the efficiency of pelagic trawl fisheries could be increased due to the improvements in the existing structural conditions and the revisions to be made in the policies implemented and the subsidies provided. However, the factors affecting inefficiency seem to be influenced by internal factors such as experience in pelagic trawling, the total crew, and the most critical issue to eliminate inefficiency seems to be increasing the subsidy rate in pelagic trawlers. In this study, it was found that the effects of engine power, total length, fuel consumption and active fishing day reduce the effect of fish catching pressure to a low level. However, other factors affecting this pressure were also included in the model. Especially when it was considered that the use of credit did not affect the efficiency, it was revealed that the increase in the subsidy rates rather than the fuel subsidy would make the trawlers more efficient.

The bycatch of Greenland halibut and the smallest polar cod was significantly reduced, while no effect was found for redfish.

For the time period between 2011 and 2015, commercial fisheries were responsible for the largest total fish biomass extraction (5,300 t per year), followed by cormorants (2,394 t per year) and recreational fishers (966 t per year). Commercial fishing dominated the removals of most marine and diadromous fish, specifically herring (Clupea harengus), while cormorants dominated the biomass extraction of smaller-bodied coastal freshwater fish, specifically perch (Perca fluviatilis) and roach (Rutilus rutilus). Pike (Esox lucius) as large-bodied freshwater fish was the only species where recreational fisheries were responsible for the major fraction of the annual biomass extraction. A strong trophic overlap and hence a similar foraging niche was documented among commercial fishers and recreational anglers and among non-resident and resident anglers, indicating that the aversion expressed by anglers against commercial fisheries in a survey had an objective underpinning related to resource competition. By contrast, the foraging niches of cormorants and of both fishers and anglers differed strongly as evidenced by largely non-overlapping sets of species that were caught and removed by cormorants and by commercial as well as recreational fishers. However, for individual species of commercial and recreational interest, specifically perch, cormorants were responsible for a major fraction of total biomass extraction, suggesting that at the individual fish species level competition with fishers and anglers may still occur. In an angler survey, respondents expressed a preference for cormorant control, indicating the existence of conflict between fisheries and cormorants. We recommend that conflicts in the lagoon fisheries be proactively managed, e.g., through improved communication, zoning, predator control and outreach. Further research should clarify the population level impacts of cormorants on target species of commercial and recreational fisheries as well as the relative impact of commercial and recreational fisheries on selected species of joint interest.;"[Arlinghaus, Robert; Komble, Dieter; Riepe, Carsten] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Biol & Ecol Fishes, Muggelseedamm 310, D-12587 Berlin, Germany; [Arlinghaus, Robert; Lucas, Jorrit] Humboldt Univ, Fac Life Sci, Div Integrat Fisheries Management, Invalidenstr 42, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Weltersbach, Marc Simon; Riepe, Carsten; Strehlow, Harry V.] Thunen Inst Baltic Sea Fisheries, Alter Hafen Sud 2, D-18069 Rostock, Germany; [Winkler, Helmut M.] Univ Rostock, Inst Biol Sci, Gen & Specif Zool, Rostock, Germany; [Kuhn, Carsten] Mecklenburg Vorpommern Res Ctr Agr & Fisheries, Inst Fisheries, Fischerweg 408, D-18069 Rostock, Germany";;Arlinghaus, R (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Biol & Ecol Fishes, Muggelseedamm 310, D-12587 Berlin, Germany.;arlinghaus@igb-berlin.de;;"Lucas, Jorrit/0000-0001-5374-495X; Strehlow, Harry/0000-0001-8765-3845; Weltersbach, Marc Simon/0000-0001-9173-5157";"European Union through the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund; State of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (Germany) [MV-I.18-LM-004, B 730117000069]; European Commission's Data Collection Framework (DCF); State Office for Agriculture, Food Safety and Fishery M-V (LALLF)";We thank the European Union through the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, and the State of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (Germany) (Grant MV-I.18-LM-004, B 730117000069) for funding of the Boddenhecht project.

The dredge catch efficiency was 79% in numbers of clams and 89% in weight. 58% of the clams caught were below the minimum conservation reference size of 25 mm. The study demonstrates that to land only the legal sizes of clams, the additional size selection process carried out on board the fishing vessels by the sorting sieves is necessary.;"[Petetta, Andrea; Bargione, Giada] Univ Bologna UNIBO, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci BIGEA, Bologna, Italy; [Petetta, Andrea; Virgili, Massimo; Bargione, Giada; Vasapollo, Claudio; Lucchetti, Alessandro] Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Biol Resources & Marine Biotechnol IRBIM, Ancona, Italy; [Herrmann, Bent] Arctic Univ Norway UIT, Hansine Hansens Veg 18, N-9019 Tromso, Norway; [Herrmann, Bent] SINTEF Ocean, Fishing Gear Technol, Willemoesvej 2, DK-9850 Hirtshals, Denmark; [Herrmann, Bent] Denmark Tech Univ, DTU Aqua, Hirtshals, Denmark";;Petetta, A (corresponding author), Univ Bologna UNIBO, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci BIGEA, Bologna, Italy.;andrea.petetta@irbim.cnr.it;"Vasapollo, Claudio/A-4456-2014; Petetta, Andrea/AAD-4089-2020";"Vasapollo, Claudio/0000-0002-5381-6690; Petetta, Andrea/0000-0003-1976-8995";MiPAAF;The research leading to these results has been conceived under the International PhD Program Innovative Technologies and Sustainable Use of Mediterranean Sea Fishery and Biological Resources (www.fishmed-phd.org).The study was made on the agreement signed between Italian Ministry for Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies (MiPAAF) and CNR IRBIM (Ancona) as part of the study preparatory to the drafting of management plans for bivalve molluscs fisheries.

The composition of discards and the impact caused to discarded species was assessed using a three-level scale (undamaged; minor or partial damage; and lethal damage). Our study revealed that a large proportion of the catch (between 67-82% weight) is discarded. Even though about 63% of the discarded species were undamaged, 11% showed minor or partial damage and 26% lethal damage.

Despite many studies having been done regarding Hg, no information is available on the potential impact of dredging required along the main channel approaching the Port of Monfalcone. Sixteen surface sediment samples were collected along the channel to determine both total Hg concentration and chemical species using the thermo-desorption (TD) technique. Six samples were also chosen to apply a selective sequential extraction (SSE). The TD technique showed the maximum Hg release approximately at 260 and 335 degrees C, corresponding to metacinnabar (beta-HgS) and cinnabar (alpha-HgS), respectively. The SSE demonstrated that Hg was mainly associated with poorly soluble or insoluble compounds (98.7%).

Based on a trawl survey conducted in 2019, 14% of the 64 species discarded on crinoid beds produce molecules with some type of bioactive potential, including; soft corals (Alcyonium palmatum); tunicates (Ascidia mentula); bony fish, such as horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus); European hake (Merluccius merluccius); and chondrichthyans, such as small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula). In addition, 16% of the discarded species had congeneric species that produce compounds with bioactive potential, indicating that such species might also possess similar types of bioactive molecules. Molecules with antioxidant, antitumour, antihypertensive, and antibacterial properties were the most frequent, which could provide the basis for future research aiming to discover new marine-based drugs and compounds for other human uses. Among all species or genera that produce compounds with bioactive potential, 68% presented medium or high vulnerability to trawling.

Because catch quality is difficult to improve once it has deteriorated, it is important to preserve quality during the catch process. Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) is the most important species in the Barents Sea bottom trawl fishery. Bottom trawling is a non-benign fishing method, and it is therefore considered important to reduce damage imparted to fish during capture, and subsequently improve catch quality and fish welfare. In the present study, the levels of damage on cod captured with a new gear design were assessed in the Barents Sea bottom trawl fishery. Furthermore, this study investigated to what extent the compulsory sorting grid and diamond mesh codend configuration employed in the fishery is responsible for the damage incurred by cod during the capture process. In total, 750 cod captured over 25 hauls were evaluated for catch damage (marks, ecchymosis, exsanguination, and scale loss). The results showed that substituting the grid and codend configuration with a four-panel selective knotless section followed by a gentle codend increased the probability of cod having no catch damage by 6.00% (CI: 0.6%-11.41%). Moreover, the gentle codend led to a significant reduction in the severity of all catch damage categories.;"[Brinkhof, Jesse; Herrmann, Bent; Larsen, Roger B.; Jacques, Nadine] Arctic Univ Norway, UiT, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Herrmann, Bent; Sistiaga, Manu; Gjosund, Svein Helge] SINTEF Ocean, Brattorkaia 17C, N-7010 Trondheim, Norway; [Sistiaga, Manu] Inst Marine Res, Postbox 1870, N-5817 Bergen, Norway";;Brinkhof, J (corresponding author), Arctic Univ Norway, UiT, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.;jesse.brinkhof@uit.no;"Larsen, Roger B./AAY-4314-2021; , ????/ABG-2761-2020";Jacques, Nadine/0000-0001-6981-3825;"Norwegian Research Council (NRC)Research Council of Norway [268388/E40]; Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries; Arctic University of Norway";Thanks to the crew of RV Helmer Hanssen and Juan Santos, Elsa Cuende, Hermann Pettersen, Ivan Tatone, Kristine Cerbule, John-Terje Eilertsen, for their valuable help during the sea trials.

The fishery is a high-volume fishery with large vessels, large demersal trawls and catches up to 100 tons per haul of this small forage fish. The Excluder is a 30 m long netting-based sorting system, developed to reduce bycatch (70 mm square meshes) and improving on board gear-handling and safety. The Excluder was tested against a 5.8 m(2) standard sorting grid (35 mm bar spacing) in a twin-trawl experiment from the commercial 70 m trawler S364 Rockall. Catch data were analysed by species and length using the catch comparison method. For all bycatch species analysed, the Excluder had significantly lower catches relative to the grid: herring (21%), whiting (6%), mackerel (5%), American plaice (70%), witch flounder (15%), and lesser silver smelt (71%). For Norway Pout there was a significant increase in the overall catch efficiency of 32%. These results are explained by a 10 cm smaller L50 (the length of fish with 50% probability of being rejected by the sorting system) of the Excluder and a 15 times larger sorting area, which reduces the risk of clogging and loss of function. With these documented effects of improved sorting and target species catch efficiency, implementation of the Excluder would improve sustainability and address two main barriers of the current Norway pout fishery that limit quota capitalization; a tendency for Norway pout to mix with herring and whiting and lowered catch rates from grid-clogging. Additionally, gear-handling and safety on board would be improved.";"[Eigaard, Ole R.] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources DTU AQUA, Lyngby, Denmark; [Herrmann, Bent] SINTEF Ocean, Trondheim, Norway; [Herrmann, Bent] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Tromso, Norway; [Feekings, Jordan P.; Krag, Ludvig A.] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources DTU AQUA, North Sea Sci Pk, Hirtshals, Denmark; [Sparrevohn, Claus R.] Danish Pelag Producers Org, Copenhagen, Denmark";;Eigaard, OR (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources DTU AQUA, Lyngby, Denmark.;ore@aqua.dtu.dk;;"Eigaard, Ole Ritzau/0000-0003-4213-2397; Feekings, Jordan P./0000-0001-9103-7332; Krag, Ludvig Ahm/0000-0002-1531-1499";Ministry of environment and food of Denmark [34009-14-0876];We wish to thank the Ministry of environment and food of Denmark for funding the work presented here through the GUDP (Green Development and Demonstration Program) (Project title Udvikling af bifangst Excluder til det Danske og Europaeiske fiskeri and number 34009-14-0876).;28;0;0;2;3;PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE;SAN FRANCISCO;1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA;1932-6203;;PLOS ONE;PLoS One;Jan/28;2021;16;1;;;;;;e0246076;10.1371/journal.pone.0246076;;;17;Multidisciplinary Sciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Science & Technology - Other Topics;RF7LJ;WOS:000635021400082;33507905;Green Published, gold;;;10/01/2022

Experimental bottom trawl hauls were conducted during 2009-2010, using identically designed trawls. All the fish in the catches were identified onboard, enumerated, and weighted to the nearest g. Species abundance and biomass were transformed to CPUE. Forty-seven taxa were identified in the catches. For 18 of the species caught no other fisheries-independent information on their abundances and distributions is available for the wider area. Among the Elasmobranchii species collected, Squalus acanthias, Dipturus oxyrinchus, and Raja clavata are species of conservation concern. Species composition was generally more similar to that reported for assemblages of the Cretan Sea and the South Aegean Sea than for assemblages of the North Aegean. The assemblages were structured with depth, a pattern that may be driven in part by the differences in benthic habitat between depth zones.

Its status as one of the world's most heavily exploited seas and the one subject to the highest trawling pressure has become a global concern. An extensive overview of bottom trawl selectivity studies was performed to assess the sustainability of this fishery in the Mediterranean. The selectivity parameters were collected from 93 peer-reviewed publications from 10 countries, totalling 742 records and 65 species. Our review highlighted that i) the catch of the bottom trawls commonly employed in the Mediterranean, although they comply with current codend mesh regulations, still includes immature individuals of 64-68% of the species investigated, and individuals under the minimum conservation reference size (MCRS) of 78% of the species investigated, and that ii) the MCRS set for 59% of the species analysed is well below their length at first maturity and is therefore ecologically inadequate. Although square-mesh codends are slightly more selective, the models developed herein demonstrate that improving size and species selectivity would require considerably larger meshes, which may significantly reduce profitability. The urgent need to mitigate the biological impacts of bottom trawling in the Mediterranean should be addressed by promoting the adoption of more ecologically sustainable fishing gears through the introduction of more selective meshes or of gear modifications.;"[Lucchetti, Alessandro; Virgili, Massimo; Vasapollo, Claudio; Petetta, Andrea; Bargione, Giada; Li Veli, Daniel; Sala, Antonello] Natl Res Council CN, Inst Biol Resources & Marine Biotechnol IRBIM, Ancona, Italy; [Brcic, Jure] Univ Split, Dept Marine Studies, Split, Croatia; [Petetta, Andrea; Bargione, Giada] Univ Bologna, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci, Bologna, Italy";;Lucchetti, A (corresponding author), Natl Res Council CN, Inst Biol Resources & Marine Biotechnol IRBIM, Ancona, Italy.;alessandro.lucchetti@cnr.it;Vasapollo, Claudio/A-4456-2014;"Vasapollo, Claudio/0000-0002-5381-6690; Bargione, Giada/0000-0001-5297-3785"; [DG MARE/2012/24-Lot 2 SI2.672370];The research leading to these results has been conceived under the International PhD Program Innovative Technologies and Sustainable Use of Mediterranean Sea Fishery and Biological Resources (www.fishmed-phd.org).This study was conducted with the contribution of the European Commission, Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries under project DISCATCH: Pilot project Catch and discard composition including solutions for limitation and possible elimination of unwanted bycatches in trawl net fisheries in the Mediterranean (DG MARE/2012/24-Lot 2 SI2.672370).

However, large-scale fisheries have grown tremendously, approaching an industrial sector in the last century, due to their socio-economic and political properties, including both national and international aspects. This progress towards industrial-scale fisheries led to the involvement of scientific research, first aiming to improve production efficiency, and then, to protect ecosystems as resources exploited for fisheries activity, by mitigating their adverse impacts. During this evolutionary progress, SSF was usually neglected because of their limited production ability, and thus minimal economic contribution, until the later phase when the protection of ecosystem resources gained sufficient importance. As a result of this, many countries lack data on SSF, undermining efforts for the creation of proper policies for this type of fisheries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the productivity and the effects of some demographic characteristics, boat structures, and some cost (input) items on the net profit of SSF in the Black Sea. The eligible sample for this study consisted of 5575 small-scale fishing boats in the Black Sea. The number of fishers to be surveyed was determined as 315 using the Simple Random Sampling method, based on operators of boats < 12 m, i.e., boats in the SSF. Questionnaires were conducted face-to-face with fishers. In this study, it was tested if six parameters were investigated to determine whether they had a significant effect on net profit in SSF. These parameters were: (1) engine power; (2) number of fishing days; (3) boat length; (4) consumption of fuel in fishing; (5) education level of fishers; and (6) overall professional experience of fishers. To do so, Simple Linear Regression Analysis was performed to determine the effect of the data considered as independent variables when the net profit was set as the dependent variable. Atlantic bonito, Sarda sarda (Bloch, 1793); whiting, Merlangius merlangus (Linnaeus, 1758); rapa whelk, Rapana venosa (Valenciennes, 1846); and turbot, Scophthalmus maximus (Linnaeus, 1758) were the most important commercial fish species for small scale fishing. When catch per boat in SSF was evaluated, Kirklareli province ranked first with 97 007 kg, with Atlantic bonito (44 778 kg) being the most common species caught. Samsun had the second-largest catch per boat with 91 761 kg. The total net profit of 303 boats was calculated as (sic)1 794 938 and the mean net profit per boat was (sic)5924. The highest per boat mean net profit ((sic)25 909) was in Kirklareli. According to the results of the study, the number of days at the sea, boat length, engine power, and fuel cost had a significant effect on the net profit while education level and professional experience were not important in productivity. The economically-fragile SSF sector may need some kind of supporting subsidy. It would be beneficial to provide support to the majority of fishers active in the SSF in terms of complementary alternative employment opportunities in the regions where they are located.";"[Dagtekin, Murat; Misir, Devrim Selim; Altuntas, Cemil; Balcik Misir, Gulsum; Cankaya, Ali] Cent Fisheries Res Inst, Trabzon, Turkey; [Sen, Isa] Mersin Univ, Dept Aquaculture, Fac Fisheries, Mersin, Turkey";;Dagtekin, M (corresponding author), Cent Fisheries Res Inst, Trabzon, Turkey.;murat.dagtekin@tarimorman.gov.tr;MISIR, Gulsum BALCIK/G-5040-2015;"MISIR, Gulsum BALCIK/0000-0001-8675-8768; DAGTEKIN, murat/0000-0003-0084-4433";"General Directorate of Agricultural Research and PoliciesGida Tarim Ve Hayvancilik Bakanligi; Investigation of Gillnets and Effects in Black Sea Fisheries project [TAGEM/HAYSUD/2015/A11/P-09/02]";This study was funded by the General Directorate of Agricultural Research and Policies.

Unlike ordinary cast nets, it is used in deep waters from shallow up to 140 meters for catching whiting (Merlangius merlangus euxinus). In this study, important findings were obtained about the operational success and duration, catch efficiency and composition of traditional deep water cast nets. The highest operation success rate was obtained from 60 to 120 meter depth with 84.2%. The highest mean CPUE was established at 0.42 kg/operation in August. The catch rate of whiting, the main target species of the study, of the total catch was calculated as 98.8%. In this study, the effect of deep water cast nets on the ecosystem was also investigated. According to the findings, fishing season and operation depth significantly affect the catch per unit effort. In terms of ecosystem-based fisheries management due to high selectivity, the low impact of ghost fishing and high survival rate of the individuals, the deep water cast net fishing was found to be beneficial. It is recommended that the performance of deep water cast nets on different species in different seas should be investigated.;"[Karadurmus, Ugur] Bandirma Onyedi Eylul Univ, Maritime Vocat Sch, Bandirma, Balikesir, Turkey; [Duzgunes, Ertug] Black Sea Tech Univ, Fac Marine Sci, Trabzon, Turkey; [Aydin, Mehmet] Ordu Univ, Fac Marine Sci, Ordu, Turkey";;Karadurmus, U (corresponding author), Bandirma Onyedi Eylul Univ, Maritime Vocat Sch, Bandirma, Balikesir, Turkey.;ukaradurmus@bandirma.edu.tr;"KARADURMUS, UGUR/O-2765-2013; KARADURMUS, UGUR/AAW-3552-2020";"KARADURMUS, UGUR/0000-0002-5827-0404; KARADURMUS, UGUR/0000-0002-5827-0404";;;24;0;0;2;2;ISTANBUL UNIV PRESS, FAC AQUATIC SCIENCES;ISTANBUL;ORDU CAD 8, ISTANBUL, 34134, TURKEY;;2602-473X;AQUAT SCI ENG;Aquat.

The experimental trials have been conducted in 2019 (July and September) on board of F/V Sveti Nikola in the Nessebar Bay at depths of 36 to 52 m, using benthic trawl. We quantify the codend size selectivity for red mullet by two parameters: L-50, the length of red mullet with a 50% probability of being retained given that they enter the codend; and selection range (SR), the difference in length of fish having respectively 75 and 25% probability of being retained. Results showed that commercially used 14 to 16 mm trawl codend, with L-50 =11.1 and 11.6 cm is not selective enough to release the immature red mullet. Mesh size of alpha =18 mm, would result in 50% retention of red mullet with a total body length of 12.4 cm. The single technical measure in place concerning red mullet exploitation in the Bulgarian Black Sea is the minimum landing size. The present research shed light on the need for new technical measures introduction - determination of mesh sizes for nets, the requirement of selective gears to reduce unwanted catches, specifications for design and use of gears, and measures to minimise the impact of fishing on the marine ecosystem and environment.";"[St Raykov, V; Raeve, Y.; Petrov, K.] Bulgarian Acad Sci IO BAS, Inst Oceanol, 40 First May St,POB 152, Varna 9000, Bulgaria; [Raeve, Y.; Petrov, K.; Nikolov, G.] Execut Agcy Fisheries & Aquaculture EAFA, 1 Kniaz Al Batenberg, Burgas 8000, Bulgaria";;St Raykov, V (corresponding author), Bulgarian Acad Sci IO BAS, Inst Oceanol, 40 First May St,POB 152, Varna 9000, Bulgaria.;vraykov@io-bas.bg;;;;;24;0;0;0;0;SCIBULCOM LTD;SOFIA;PO BOX 249, 1113 SOFIA, BULGARIA;1311-5065;;J ENVIRON PROT ECOL;J.

As ectotherms are generally smaller and grow faster with increasing temperature, they may be less vulnerable to trawling and quicker to replenish biomass in warmer waters. Therefore, the chronic effect of bottom trawling on benthic invertebrate biomass may depend on local sea temperature and, hence, be under the influence of climate change. We tested this hypothesis using benthic grab samples from 200 sites spanning the North Sea and data on trawling pressure in the areas where samples were collected. The relationship between benthic community biomass and swept area ratio (the average number of times the seabed is trawled per year) was negative where annual bottom water temperature was low (8 degrees C), positive in relatively warm water (11 degrees C) and approximately neutral at intermediate temperature (9.5 degrees C). These relationships were attributed to changes in mean body mass, not community abundance. Our results are consistent with theoretical expectations and suggest that climate modulates the chronic effect of bottom trawling on benthic invertebrate biomass. Confirming causality and determining the broader consequences for community structure and ecosystem functioning should be priorities of future research.;"[Clare, David S.; Birchenough, Silvana N.

A sharp decrease in the beam trawl catch observed since 2015 has raised concern about not only socio-economic issues but also ecological issues and the effect that beam trawl fisheries have had on exploited stocks. Besides the effect that beam trawl fisheries can have on targeted economically important species, intensive dredging can cause long-term changes in the benthic community. Therefore, this study aimed to detect the effect that this type of fishing gear has on target and by-catch species. Furthermore, survey data were compared with the official beam trawl fishery data gathered through Vessel Monitoring System data together with fishermen's logbooks. Our research targeted two adjacent areas: an area where beam trawl fishing is allowed and an area where it is forbidden. The results demonstrate that the commercially important catch represented a minor share of the total beam trawl catch in both survey areas, while discard made up more than 93% of the total catch. The main beam trawl commercially important species in the Croatian part of the northern Adriatic Sea was Pecten jacobaeus, followed by Solea solea and Ostrea edulis. Our results suggest that beam trawl fisheries mostly affect target bivalve species and some non-commercial benthic species (e.g. sponges). The differences recorded between areas could suggest that beam trawl fisheries cause changes mostly in the P. jacobaeus population.;"[Ezgeta-Balic, Daria; Vrgoc, Nedo; Isajlovic, Igor; Medvesek, Damir; Despalatovic, Marija; Cvitkovic, Ivan] Inst Oceanog & Fisheries, Setaliste Ivana Mestrovica 63, Split 21000, Croatia; [Vujevic, Ante] Minist Agr, Directorate Fisheries, Alexandera von Humboldta 4b, Zagreb 10000, Croatia";;Ezgeta-Balic, D (corresponding author), Inst Oceanog & Fisheries, Setaliste Ivana Mestrovica 63, Split 21000, Croatia.;ezgeta@izor.hr;Balic, Daria Ezgeta/G-9440-2017;"Balic, Daria Ezgeta/0000-0003-0763-3647; Vujevic, Ante/0000-0002-2683-1764";"Directorate of Fisheries of the Croatian Ministry of Agriculture; Ministry of AgricultureGida Tarim Ve Hayvancilik Bakanligi";This work has been fully supported by the Directorate of Fisheries of the Croatian Ministry of Agriculture.

To analyse how the adaption of pulse trawling changed this fishery, we studied fishing speeds and landings per unit effort as proxies for catch efficiencies for the main target species. Compared to conventional tickler chain beam trawls, pulse trawls were towed at lower speeds (small vessels -10%, large vessels -23%). Large vessels that switched from conventional beam trawls to pulse trawls at the end of 2009 gradually increased catch efficiency for sole over the period of almost 1 year. While pulse trawling was found to have higher catch rates (kg/h) for sole (small vessels +74%, large vessels +17%), lower catch rates were observed for plaice (small vessels -31%, large vessels -32%). Vessels that switched later achieved immediate gains in catch efficiency for sole. The change in catch efficiency is likely due to the difference in cramp response between the species.;"[Poos, Jan-Jaap; Rijnsdorp, Adriaan D.] Wageningen Univ, Dept Anim Sci Aquaculture & Fisheries, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Poos, Jan-Jaap; Hintzen, Niels T.; van Rijssel, Jacco C.; Rijnsdorp, Adriaan D.] Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen Marine Res, Ijmuiden, Netherlands";;"Poos, JJ (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Dept Anim Sci Aquaculture & Fisheries, Wageningen, Netherlands.; Poos, JJ (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen Marine Res, Ijmuiden, Netherlands.";janjaap.poos@wur.nl;"Rijnsdorp, Adriaan/A-4217-2008; Poos, Jan Jaap/B-9940-2009; van Rijssel, Jacco/L-6177-2017";"Rijnsdorp, Adriaan/0000-0003-0785-9662; Poos, Jan Jaap/0000-0002-8507-5751; van Rijssel, Jacco/0000-0001-8038-9674";European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) through the Netherlands Ministry of Agriculture Nature and Food Quality (LNV) [1300021172];This study was in part funded by the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) through the Netherlands Ministry of Agriculture Nature and Food Quality (LNV) (Grant/Award Number: 1300021172).;61;6;6;1;1;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;1054-3139;1095-9289;ICES J MAR SCI;ICES J.

The study presents a stepwise procedure, devised to estimate discard survival, that accounts for the variability characterizing commercial fishing practices. The procedure was applied to the first survival study performed onboard rapido trawlers targeting Solea solea in the Mediterranean Sea. Undersized specimens collected during sorting were assessed for vitality; some were retained for captive observation. The main drivers affecting discard survival at the time of catch sorting (immediate survival) were identified and used to outline four different operational conditions set (scenarios). Immediate survival in each scenario was subsequently modified by applying a hazard coefficient of survival after 5 days of captive observation in relation to each vitality class, thus obtaining relative survival estimates following discarding. Temperature and air exposure duration were found to exert a major effect on survival, with catch weight and seabed type being additional important factors. The relative survival rate showed an aggregate value of 22.9% (10.5-33.4%). Scenario approach can enhance our understanding of the stressors influencing discard survival.

This change has been recommended in the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean and European Commission regulations. However, ecosystem-based assessment of improved selectivity still remains a challenge, and that is the aim of this study. For this purpose, an Ecopath model was developed and used to initialize dynamic simulations in Ecosim. The simulations changed gear-specific fishing mortality rates to represent the shifting from traditional codend to alternative codends. Our results suggest that the use of D50 or S40 codends would have a positive impact on the ecosystem as a whole and on the stock status of several commercial and non-commercial groups. Mixed trophic impact analysis indicated that, for species, like red mullet, the S40 codend was significantly better than the D50 codend. This information can be useful to policymakers, particularly for the areas where red mullet is the main target species and could inform trawl mesh options in the eastern Mediterranean.;"[Saygu, Ismet; Gokce, Gokhan] Cukurova Univ, Fisheries Fac, Adana, Turkey; [Heymans, Johanna J.; Fox, Clive] Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Scottish Marine Inst, Oban, Argyll, Scotland; [Heymans, Johanna J.] European Marine Board, Wandelaarkaai 7, B-8400 Oostende, Belgium; [Ozbilgin, Huseyin] Mersin Univ, Fisheries Fac, Mersin, Turkey; [Bentley, Jacob W.] UN Environm World Conservat Monitoring Ctr, Cambridge, England; [Bentley, Jacob W.] Univ Kent, Sch Anthropol & Conservat, Durrell Inst Conservat & Ecol, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Eryasar, Ahmet Raif] Recep Tayyip Erdogan Univ, Vocat Sch Tech Sci, Rize, Turkey";;Saygu, I (corresponding author), Cukurova Univ, Fisheries Fac, Adana, Turkey.;ismetsaygu@gmail.com;;Fox, Clive/0000-0002-8449-0996;"Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) on the TUBITAKTurkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK) [2214-A, 2014-2]; Scottish Association for Marine Science (SAMS); TUBITAKTurkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK) [109O684]";The article is based on work in the PhD thesis of IS, funded by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) on the TUBITAK 2214-A, Programme 2014-2 and supported by the Scottish Association for Marine Science (SAMS) as host institution.

To identify populations at risk, it is essential to estimate the total number of individuals removed from a population as bycatch. However, estimating total bycatch remains challenging due to the often-limited scope of monitoring programmes. In this study, we aimed to maximise the value of limited bycatch data collected by scientific observers and self-reported by fishers to provide estimates of total seal bycatch for static net fisheries operating in Irish waters. We constructed a model of bycatch rate as a function of known predictors of seal bycatch, and used this to predict bycatch rates throughout the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone. Annual estimates of seal bycatch, from 2011 to 2016, ranged between 202 (90% CI: 2-433) and 349 (90% CI: 6-833) seals per annum. Estimated bycatch exceeded the precautionary threshold of Potential Biological Removal (PBR = 165-218; F-r = 0.5) for the national grey seal population but was below less conservative threshold values (PBR = 330-437; F-r = 1.0), with confidence intervals spanning both. Further research on the population structure of grey seals in the Northeast Atlantic is needed to set appropriate bycatch thresholds. Nonetheless, this study shows that by utilising predictive models to maximise the value of limited bycatch observer effort, we can produce informative estimates of protected species bycatch and highlight areas of high bycatch risk. We present this as a case study for maritime nations with comparatively limited bycatch data to fill key data gaps in protected species bycatch worldwide. (C) 2020 The Authors.

A new kind of acoustic alerting device (Porpoise ALert, PAL) was tested in commercial gillnet fisheries in the western Baltic. PAL emits 133 kHz synthetic harbour porpoise communication signals, unlike conventional acoustic deterrent devices (pingers), which emit artificial noise. Trials were undertaken by three commercial gillnet vessels conducting 778 trips during standard fishing operations from 2014 to 2016. In all, 1120 PAL-equipped net strings were tested against 1529 simultaneously set control strings with no devices. We tested two versions of the PAL (v1 and v2) consecutively. These were spaced <=210 m apart on the gillnet floatlines, with all devices pointing in the same direction to ensure complete acoustic coverage of the strings. Two vessels fished in Kiel Bight and around Fehmarn Island in German waters, and the third vessel fished in the Oresund, in inner Danish waters. Overall, 18 harbour porpoises were by caught in control strings (mean 0.01 + 0.1/haul), and five harbour porpoises were taken as bycatch in strings equipped with PALs (0.004 +/- 0.07/haul). The number of net string bycatches was analysed using a generalised linear mixed model (GLMM). The model applied to all observations revealed that the expected bycatch was significantly influenced by PAL deployment (p < 0.05), decreasing the expected bycatch by 64.9 % (95 % confidence interval (CI): 8.7-88.7 %). PAL effectiveness was also increased by reducing device spacing to <=200 m (16 bycatches in control, three in PAL strings; mean bycatch reduction 79.7 %). Additional model cases were applied to the data and are discussed. We conclude that, with this specific communication signal, PAL can significantly reduce harbour porpoise bycatch in gillnets deployed in the western Baltic Sea, thus reconciling anthropogenic activities with protection of the marine environment.";"[Chladek, Jerome; von Dorrien, Christian] Thunen Inst Baltic Sea Fisheries, Alter Hafen Sud 2, D-18069 Rostock, Germany; [Culik, Boris] F3 Forsch Fakten Fantasie, Reff 1, D-24226 Heikendorf, Germany; [Kindt-Larsen, Lotte; Albertsen, Christoffer Moesgaard] Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Aqua, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark";;Chladek, J (corresponding author), Thunen Inst Baltic Sea Fisheries, Alter Hafen Sud 2, D-18069 Rostock, Germany.;chladek-sc@posteo.de;", ????/ABG-2761-2020; Albertsen, Christoffer Moesgaard/P-1108-2014";"Kindt-Larsen, Lotte/0000-0003-4696-5943; Albertsen, Christoffer Moesgaard/0000-0003-0088-4363";"German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) [2819100612, 2819100512]; European Maritime and Fisheries Fund; Danish Fisheries Agency";This work was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) [Grant No. 2819100612 to F3, Boris Culik, and Grant No. 2819100512 to Thunen Institute of Baltic Sea Fisheries] as well as the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and the Danish Fisheries Agency.;50;2;2;3;13;ELSEVIER;AMSTERDAM;RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0165-7836;1872-6763;FISH RES;Fish Res.;DEC;2020;232;;;;;;;105732;10.1016/j.fishres.2020.105732;;;10;Fisheries;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Fisheries;OF0JJ;WOS:000580905400016;;;;;10/01/2022

Although it is prohibited to catch fish using electricity in European Union waters, a number of beam trawlers obtained a derogation and switched to pulse trawling to explore the potential to reduce impacts. Here we analyse whether using electrical rather than mechanical stimulation results in an overall reduction in physical disturbance of the seafloor in the beam-trawl fishery for sole Solea solea. We extend and apply a recently developed assessment framework to the Dutch beam-trawl fleet and show that the switch to pulse trawling substantially reduced benthic impacts when exploiting the total allowable catch of sole in the North Sea. Using Vessel Monitoring by Satellite and logbook data from 2009 to 2017, we estimate that the trawling footprint decreased by 23%, the precautionary impact indicator of the benthic community decreased by 39%, the impact on median longevity of the benthic community decreased by 20%, the impact on benthic biomass decreased by 61%, and the amount of sediment mobilised decreased by 39%. The decrease in impact is due to the replacement of tickler chains by electrode arrays, a lower towing speed and higher catch efficiency for sole. The effort and benthic physical disturbance of the beam-trawl fishery targeting plaice Pleuronectes platessa in the central North Sea increased with the recovery of the plaice stock. Our study illustrates the utility of a standardized methodological framework to assess the differences in time trends and physical disturbance between gears.;"[Rijnsdorp, A. D.; Hintzen, N.

In contrast, its use in fisheries management is hampered by coverage and transmission gaps. Transmission gaps may be due to technical limitations (e.g., weak signal or interference with other signals) or to deliberate switching off of the system, to conceal fishing activities. In either case such gaps may result in underestimating fishing effort and pressure. This study was undertaken to map and analyze bottom trawler transmission gaps in terms of duration and distance from the harbor with a view to quantifying unobserved fishing and its effects on overall trawling pressure. Here we present the first map of bottom trawler AIS transmission gaps in the Mediterranean Sea and a revised estimate of fishing effort if some gaps are considered as actual fishing.;"[Ferra, Carmen; Tassetti, Anna Nora; Armelloni, Enrico Nicola; Scarcella, Giuseppe; Fabi, Gianna] CNR, Inst Biol Resources & Marine Biotechnol, Ancona, Italy; [Galdelli, Alessandro] Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Informat Engn, Ancona, Italy";;Tassetti, AN (corresponding author), CNR, Inst Biol Resources & Marine Biotechnol, Ancona, Italy.;annanora.tassetti@cnr.it;"Tassetti, Anna Nora/O-4087-2016; Ferra, Carmen/G-7684-2018; Galdelli, Alessandro/AAS-2511-2021";"Tassetti, Anna Nora/0000-0001-5946-7877; Ferra, Carmen/0000-0001-5850-8999; Armelloni, Enrico Nicola/0000-0002-6679-1912";;;45;4;4;1;3;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND;;2296-7745;FRONT MAR SCI;Front.

However, the critical gaps in scientific knowledge associated with these impacts on untargeted but functionally important species remain to be filled. This is notably the case for a great proportion of discarded invertebrates, for which only a handful of studies have investigated their survival. In this study, 600 individuals from six different benthic invertebrate species were collected in commercial conditions in the Bay of Biscay for short-term survival experiments. Overall, the observed survival after 100-130 h and the predicted survival via mixture models were very high (>93%) for Asterias rubens, Aphrodita aculeata, Buccinum undatum and Pagurus sp. Survival of Maja brachydactyla was lower though still high (>80% overall) and Atelecyclus undecimdentatus was more vulnerable to trawling and handling, with similar to 50% of survival. Both showed 100% mortality when presenting carapace cracks and survival of M. brachydactyla was lower when missing appendages. No biotic nor abiotic parameters were correlated to survival, except injury class for M. brachydactyla and A. undecimdentatus. This study shows an overall high survival but highlights the fact that otter trawl fisheries may differentially affect discarded benthic invertebrates, therefore bringing light for future studies on longer-term impacts on benthic communities and coastal ecosystems. Furthermore, we recommend incorporating survival rates of discarded invertebrates in ecosystem-level modelling studies and encourage the use of detailed information and biomass reports of benthic invertebrates for a better management of natural populations and fisheries resources.

Therefore, it is of great importance to evaluate the different impacts of such industries, in order to enable reasonable and sustainable decisions on environmental issues (e.g., nature conservation). Bottom trawling has a significant impact on benthic habitats worldwide. Fishing gear penetrates the seabed and the resulting furrows temporarily remain in the sediment known as trawl marks (TM), which can be recognized in the acoustic signal of side-scan sonars (SSS) and multibeam echo sounders (MBES). However, extensive mapping and precise descriptions of TM from commercial fisheries at far offshore fishing grounds in the German EEZ are not available. To get an insight into the spatial patterns and characteristics of TM, approximately 4800 km(2) of high-resolution (1 m) SSS data from three different study sites in the German EEZ were analyzed for changes in TM density as well as for the geometry of individual TM. TM were manually digitalized and their density per square kilometer was calculated. In general, TM density was highest in August and October. Moreover, different gear types could be identified from investigating individual TM in SSS data. Beam trawl marks were observed to have widths of up to 22 m whereas otter board marks showed widths up to 6 m. The persistence of TM was estimated to 2-7 days minimum for all three sites based on the SSS data from 2015-2019. A maximum persistence could be defined at one site (Dogger Bank) and it was five months for the investigation period 2016-2017. Besides the main factors driving TM degradation (wave-base impact, sediment-type), different methods for TM detection (SSS, MBES, under-water video) are discussed. The study provides valuable information on the physical impact of bottom trawling on the seabed and can support existing monitoring strategies.;"[Bruns, Ines; Holler, Peter; Capperucci, Ruggero M.; Bartholoma, Alexander] Senckenberg Meer, Dept Marine Res, Sudstrand 40, D-26382 Wilhelmshaven, Germany; [Bruns, Ines] Univ Bremen, Dept Geosci, Klagenfurter Str 4, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Papenmeier, Svenja] Leibniz Inst Baltic Sea Res Warnemunde, Seestr 15, D-18119 Rostock, Germany";;"Bruns, I (corresponding author), Senckenberg Meer, Dept Marine Res, Sudstrand 40, D-26382 Wilhelmshaven, Germany.; Bruns, I (corresponding author), Univ Bremen, Dept Geosci, Klagenfurter Str 4, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.";"ines.bruns@senckenberg.de; peter.holler@senckenberg.de; ruggero.capperucci@senckenberg.de; svenja.papenmeier@io-warnemuende.de; alexander.bartholomae@senckenberg.de";"; Papenmeier, Svenja/L-2735-2017";"Capperucci, Ruggero/0000-0001-9089-9715; Bruns, Ines/0000-0003-3864-7283; Papenmeier, Svenja/0000-0002-2385-5269";"BSH, Bundesamt fur Seeschifffahrt und Hydrographie, ASKAWZ III [10038520]; German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (BfN, Bundesamt fur Naturschutz)";This research was conducted in the framework of the ASKAWZ project, which is a research and development cooperation between Senckenberg am Meer and the German Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH, Bundesamt fur Seeschifffahrt und Hydrographie, ASKAWZ III Contract-No. 10038520).

The northern Adriatic Sea has been identified as an important marine mammal area because of a regular occurrence of common bottlenose dolphins. Boat surveys were conducted within a 3,000 km(2) sector of the Adriatic Sea off the coast of Veneto, Italy, between April and October 2018-2019. Based on 76 days at sea, 10,711 km of navigation, and 81 h 26 min of dolphin tracking, this study contributes novel quantitative information on dolphin spatial distribution, and on their occurrence in the wake of beam trawlers, otter trawlers, and midwater pair trawlers. A combined generalized additive model and generalized estimation equation framework indicated that trawling-along with other physiographic, biological and anthropogenic variables-influenced dolphin distribution. In days of trawling, the chance of encountering dolphins increased by similar to 4.5 times (95% confidence interval 1.8-11.0) near active beam trawlers, by similar to 16.0 times (7.1-36.0) near otter trawlers, and by similar to 28.9 times (12.0-69.6) near midwater pair trawlers. Spatial modelling was used to create maps of predicted distribution, suggesting differences in habitat use between trawling and no-trawling days. Spatial modelling for all days identified a dolphin distribution hotspot of 832 km(2), situated off the Po river delta. Evidence contributed by this study can be used to inform management action within one of the world's areas most heavily impacted by fishing and other human encroachment. Such management action would help enforce the European Union's Habitats Directive and Marine Strategy Framework Directive, while also informing EU's Maritime Spatial Planning.;"[Bonizzoni, Silvia; Furey, Nathan B.; Bearzi, Giovanni] Dolphin Biol & Conservat, Cordenons, Italy; [Bonizzoni, Silvia; Bearzi, Giovanni] OceanCare, Wadenswil, Switzerland; [Furey, Nathan B.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Biol Sci, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Bearzi, Giovanni] ISMAR Inst Marine Sci, CNR Natl Res Council, Venice, Italy";;Bonizzoni, S (corresponding author), Dolphin Biol & Conservat, Cordenons, Italy.;silvia.bonizzoni@gmail.com;"Bonizzoni, Silvia/AAC-4612-2021; Furey, Nathan/J-4862-2012";"Bonizzoni, Silvia/0000-0001-7331-4439; Bearzi, Giovanni/0000-0001-6633-3324; Furey, Nathan/0000-0002-8584-7889";"OceanCare; ARPAV, the Regional Environmental Protection Agency of Veneto, between June and September 2018; ESRI";This study was funded by OceanCare.

A substantial amount of the traceable marine litter originates from tourism and recreational activities. An important activity carried out in coastal areas is marine recreational fishing (MRF). Although the impacts of MRF on marine ecosystems has received increasing attention during recent years, the contribution of MRF to marine litter is widely unknown. Marine litter is caused by human activities and its avoidance requires an understanding of environmental behaviour. This study presents results obtained by a telephone survey aimed to assess the behaviour, motivations and attitudes of Baltic Sea anglers towards marine litter. The telephone survey identified three angler types primarily separated by the predominant motives regarding nature experience, catch orientation and challenge seeking. Regardless of their motivation, most anglers were concerned about marine litter, recognised their responsibility and were willing to contribute to litter avoidance and mitigation. The telephone survey was supplemented by face-to-face angler interviews during a stratified random access point intercept survey along the German Baltic coast to estimate the amount of lost fishing tackle based on anglers self-reports. According to the reports, the loss of fishing tackle was a rare event for individual anglers. Nonetheless, given a high number of Baltic Sea anglers and angling effort, local environmental impacts due to lost fishing tackle on marine environments cannot be excluded.;"[Lewin, Wolf-Christian; Weltersbach, Marc Simon; Denfeld, Gloria; Strehlow, Harry, V] Thunen Inst Baltic Sea Fisheries, Alter Hafen Sud 2, D-18069 Rostock, Germany";;Lewin, WC (corresponding author), Thunen Inst Baltic Sea Fisheries, Alter Hafen Sud 2, D-18069 Rostock, Germany.;wolf-christian.lewin@thuenen.de;;Weltersbach, Marc Simon/0000-0001-9173-5157;"Lower Saxony Water Management, Coastal Defence, and Nature Conservation Agency (NLWKN); State Agency for the Environment, Nature Conservation, and Geology of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (LUNG) [62180-04-M06]; European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [508/2014]; German Federal Ministry of Education and ResearchFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [01LC1826E]";This study was funded by the Lower Saxony Water Management, Coastal Defence, and Nature Conservation Agency (NLWKN) and the State Agency for the Environment, Nature Conservation, and Geology of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (LUNG) (62180-04-M06) and further co-funded by the European Commission's Data Collection Framework (DCF) (No 508/2014).

Here, we sample seabed communities from small polychaetes (<0.001 g) to large fish (> 1 kg) in the Celtic Sea and the western English Channel to examine how bottom trawling and primary production affect their size spectra and to compare these with predictions from a model that couples predator and detritivore communities. Size spectra were not well approximated by linear fits because of truncation of the size spectra of detritivores. Low primary production resulted in lower abundance of benthic fauna. Bottom trawling reduced the abundance of predators and large detritivores but allowed small detritivores to increase in abundance. These empirical size spectra were partly consistent with predictions from the size spectra model, showing that understanding the structuring of benthic communities requires a consideration of both size and functional group. The findings highlight the need for an ecosystem approach to understanding the effects of exploitation and climate change on marine ecosystems.;"[Howarth, Leigh M.; Waggitt, James J.; Allender, Susan; Hiddink, Jan G.] Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Gwynedd, Wales; [Somerfield, Paul J.] Plymouth Marine Lab, Prospect Pl, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England; [Blanchard, Julia L.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia";;Hiddink, JG (corresponding author), Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Gwynedd, Wales.;j.hiddink@bangor.ac.uk;"Hiddink, Jan Geert/C-1238-2009; Blanchard, Julia L/E-4919-2010; Somerfield, Paul/J-9189-2014";"Hiddink, Jan Geert/0000-0001-7114-830X; Blanchard, Julia L/0000-0003-0532-4824; Somerfield, Paul/0000-0002-7581-5621";"Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/L003279/1]; Department for Environment, Food and Rural AffairsDepartment for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) [NE/L003279/1]; Natural Environment Research Council through its National Capability Long-term Single Centre Science Programme, Climate Linked Atlantic Sector Science [NE/R015953/1]; NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [pml010009, NE/P021107/1, NE/L003201/1, pml010007, NE/K00204X/1, NE/H01747X/1, NE/L003279/1, pml010003, NE/T010843/1, pml010004] Funding Source: UKRI";This work was supported by the Natural Environment Research Council and Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (grant No. NE/L003279/1, Marine Ecosystems Research Programme).

Trawling effect may be dependent on the spatial and temporal distribution of abrasion, the habitat type including natural perturbation intensity and the fishing gear used. Nonetheless, there is an urgent need to identify or develop indices likely to measure the effect of trawling. For this purpose benthic fauna by-catch monitored in scientific trawl surveys carried out in all European waters in the frame of the Common Fishery Policy Data Collection Multiannual Program may be used. Benthic invertebrates data used in this study were collected during scientific bottom trawl surveys covering the English Channel, the North Sea and the North-West Mediterranean. Swept area ratios derived from VMS data were used to quantify the intensity of fishery induced abrasion on the seabed. Fifteen indices were investigated: taxonomic diversity metrics, functional di-versity indices and functional indices, the two later based on sensitivity traits to physical abrasion. Their properties, such as their capacity to detect trawling effect, their statistical behavior or their ability to inform on community structure, were investigated. Among them, fours indices specific to fishery effect detection based on biological traits appeared to be the best performing benthic indices regarding these requirements: Trawling Disturbance Index (TDI), modified-Trawling Disturbance Index (mTDI), partial-Trawling Disturbance Index (pTDI), modified sensitivity index (mT). Maps of the distribution pattern of seabed sensitivity captured through each of these four indices were produced. This work has highlighted the need to use specific indices to monitor the effect of trawling on benthic communities but also that the use of different indices may be necessary to carry out this monitoring in all European waters.;"[Jac, Cyrielle; Certain, Gregoire; Vaz, Sandrine] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, IFREMER, MARBEC,IRD, Sete, France; [Desroy, Nicolas; Foveau, Aurelie] IFREMER, Lab Environm & Ressources Bretagne Nord, 38 Rue Port Blanc, F-35800 Dinard, France; [Labrune, Celine] Sorbonne Univ, Lab Ecogeochim Environm Benth, CNRS, LECOB UMR 8222, F-66650 Banyuls Sur Mer, France";;Jac, C (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, CNRS, IFREMER, MARBEC,IRD, Sete, France.;cyrielle.jac@ifremer.fr;;"Nicolas, Desroy/0000-0002-9047-5637; Vaz, Sandrine/0000-0002-7365-8335; Foveau, Aurelie/0000-0001-6283-2214";"EC2CO National Program on Coastal Environments (Bentchal); EUEuropean Commission [11.0661/2017/750680/SUB/ENV.C2]; Occitanie region";"The authors are grateful to the projects leaders of MEDITS, CGFS, IBTS and CAMANOC scientific surveys, the scientific staff and vessel crews who participated to these surveys.

Nephrops norvegicus is an important target species in many fisheries across Europe in the Mediterranean Sea, NE Atlantic Ocean and North Sea. Historically, Mediterranean fisheries have had a high discard rate of small-sized Nephrops, and it is suspected that this unwanted component of the catch may have a high survival potential that is comparable to those of other EU fisheries, where survival rates of up to 0.56 have been demonstrated. However, to date, no investigations have confirmed a high discard survival rate for Nephrops in the Mediterranean Sea. Furthermore, the environmental, technical and biological characteristics that could affect Nephrops survival have been shown to be substantially different from those in the survival assessments conducted in the NE Atlantic and the North Sea. To address this knowledge gap, this study was conducted to determine the survival of Nephrops discarded from trawls in the Mediterranean Sea. The survival and vitality status of the discarded Nephrops removed from trawl catches were monitored onboard and for 14 days in the laboratory. The results showed seasonality in survival, with the highest survival rate in winter (0.74; CI: 0.7 - 0.78), lower survival in spring (0.36; CI: 0.31 -0.41) and the lowest survival in summer (0.06; CI: 0.04 - 0.09).

In this basin small scale fisheries (SSFs) play a major socioeconomic role in terms of fleet size, number of jobs and amount and value of landings. Passive nets (chiefly gillnets (GNs) and trammel nets (TNs)) are the most common fishing gears employed by SSFs. Since they are considered more selective and less harmful to stocks and habitats than other gears such as trawls, their selectivity and impacts are less explored. This study was performed to provide an accurate description of the selectivity of Mediterranean GNs and TNs in relation to legal provisions and the biological features of their most common target species. It was found that the minimum conservation reference size (MCRS) set for certain species is well under their length at first maturity (LFM) and does not contribute to sustainability. Moreover, a thorough overview of the technical features of Mediterranean passive nets highlighted that they catch mature individuals above the MCRS and are therefore size-selective. This characteristic goes a considerable way towards achieving several conservation priorities: to reduce fishing mortality, to minimize the capture of juveniles and discards, to spare sexually immature individuals, thus improving spawning stock biomass and increasing the yield per recruit while attenuating the impacts on benthic ecosystems.;"[Lucchetti, A.; Virgili, M.; Petetta, A.] Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Biol Resources & Marine Biotechnol IRBIM, Ancona, Italy; [Petetta, A.] Univ Bologna, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci, Bologna, Italy; [Sartor, P.] Consorzio Il Ctr Interuniv Biol Marina Ecol Appli, Livorno, Italy";;Lucchetti, A (corresponding author), Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Biol Resources & Marine Biotechnol IRBIM, Ancona, Italy.;alessandro.lucchetti@cnr.it;"Petetta, Andrea/AAD-4089-2020; Lucchetti, Alessandro/AAV-7188-2020";"Petetta, Andrea/0000-0003-1976-8995; Lucchetti, Alessandro/0000-0001-8418-9848";LIFE financial instrument of the European Community, DELFI Project - Dolphin Experience: Lowering Fishing Interactions [LIFE18NAT/IT/000942];This study was conducted with the contribution of the LIFE financial instrument of the European Community, DELFI Project - Dolphin Experience: Lowering Fishing Interactions (LIFE18NAT/IT/000942).

However, there is still little knowledge surrounding the impact of fishing on species of skate in the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. Using data from historical records, landings and vulnerability of the species, this study analyses the potential impact of trawling on species of skate in two areas: the western Mediterranean (Alboran Sea) and the Gulf of Cadiz. Results show that trawling mainly affects one species in the western Mediterranean, the starry ray (Raja asterias). In the Gulf of Cadiz, the three skate species that are mainly affected are the thornback ray (Raja clavata), the starry ray (R. asterias) and the undulate skate (R. undulata), but also five other species were caught in the same area, Leucoraja naveus, L. circularis, Raja brachyura, R. miraletus and R. montagui. Vulnerability assessment of the species indicate that all skate species, except Raja asterias, R. miraletus and R. montagui, achieve high vulnerability index (i.e. IV > 60) and all (except R miraletus and R. montagui) are classified in the IUCN Red List as near threatened or endangered species. Based on the results, this study proposes recommendations for measures to protect skates from trawling in these areas.;"[Biton-Porsmoguer, Sebastian; Lloret, Josep] Univ Girona, Fac Sci, Inst Aquat Ecol, C Maria Aurelia Capmany 69, E-17003 Catalonia, Spain";;Biton-Porsmoguer, S (corresponding author), Univ Girona, Fac Sci, Inst Aquat Ecol, C Maria Aurelia Capmany 69, E-17003 Catalonia, Spain.;"sebastianbiton@gmail.com; josep.lloret@udg.edu";"LLORET, Josep/D-4886-2013; LLORET, Josep/ABC-1251-2021; BITON-PORSMOGUER, Sebastian/P-8306-2017";"LLORET, Josep/0000-0002-3917-1152; LLORET, Josep/0000-0002-3917-1152; BITON-PORSMOGUER, Sebastian/0000-0002-0251-8271";"FLAG Costa Brava (European Maritime and Fisheries Fund); FLAG Costa Brava (Government of Catalonia);  [ROMP-2017-200053791]";The authors would like to thank all the Spanish Autonomous Communities for providing data on catch and fleet statistics.

In three studies, Nephrops were sampled from trawlers in northern European waters, and the fate of individuals monitored for a minimum of 13 days in onshore tanks. Winter estimates of captive survival (means +/- 95% confidence intervals), including immediate mortality during catch sorting, were 62 +/- 2.8% for the West of Scotland, 57 +/- 1.8% for the Farne Deeps (North Sea), and 67 +/- 5.4% for the Skagerrak. The Farne Deeps fishery is not active in summer, but captive survival rates in summer in the other two areas were reduced to 47 +/- 3.4% for West of Scotland and 40 +/- 4.8% for the Skagerrak. Linear modelling of the West of Scotland and Skagerrak data suggested that higher survivals in winter were related to colder water or air temperatures, although temperatures during captive observation may also have had an impact. Net modifications in the Skagerrak study had an effect on survival, which was higher for Nephrops sampled from nets equipped with the more selective Swedish sorting grid compared to Seltra trawls.;"[Fox, Clive J.] Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, Scotland; [Albalat, Amaya] Univ Stirling, Inst Aquaculture, Pathfoot Bldg, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [Valentinsson, Daniel; Nilsson, Hans C.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Inst Marine Res, Dept Aquat Resources, Turistgatan 5, SE-45330 Lysekil, Sweden; [Armstrong, Frank; Randall, Peter; Catchpole, Thomas] Ctr Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Pakefield Rd, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England";;Fox, CJ (corresponding author), Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, Scotland.;clive.fox@sams.ac.uk;;"Valentinsson, Daniel/0000-0003-0456-3436; Fox, Clive/0000-0002-8449-0996; Albalat, Amaya/0000-0002-8606-2995; Randall, Peter/0000-0002-5638-7967; Catchpole, Thomas/0000-0002-5218-7749";"Fisheries Innovation Scotland [FIS015]; UK Defra program [ASSIST MF1232]; Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management [1861-2019]";"Studies in Division VIa were funded by a grant (FIS015) from Fisheries Innovation Scotland; studies Division IVb were funded by UK Defra program ASSIST MF1232; and studies in Division IIIa were funded by the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (grant no. 1861-2019).";41;1;1;0;4;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;1054-3139;1095-9289;ICES J MAR SCI;ICES J.

To mitigate such disturbances, the development of fisheries-, conservation-, and ecosystem-based management strategies requires the assessment of the impact of bottom trawling on the state of benthic biota. We explore a quantitative and mechanistic framework to assess trawling impact. Pressure and impact indicators that provide a continuous pressure-response curve are estimated at a spatial resolution of 1 x 1 min latitude and longitude (similar to 2km(2)) using three methods: L1 estimates the proportion of the community with a life span exceeding the time interval between trawling events; L2 estimates the decrease in median longevity in response to trawling; and population dynamic (PD) estimates the decrease in biomass in response to trawling and the recovery time. Although impact scores are correlated, PD has the best performance over a broad range of trawling intensities. Using the framework in a trawling impact assessment of ten metiers in the North Sea shows that muddy habitats are impacted the most and coarse habitats are impacted the least. Otter trawling for crustaceans has the highest impact, followed by otter trawling for demersal fish and beam trawling for flatfish and flyshooting. Beam trawling for brown shrimps, otter trawling for industrial fish, and dredging for molluscs have the lowest impact. Trawling is highly aggregated in core fishing grounds where the status of the seafloor is low but the catch per unit of effort (CPUE) per unit of impact is high, in contrast to peripheral grounds, where CPUE per unit of impact is low.";"[Rijnsdorp, A.

In the Western Baltic Sea (WBS), the spatio-temporal distribution of cod is still largely unknown despite decades of research. We studied changes in cod distribution by obtaining information on temporal depth and habitat use of cod from commercial gillnet fishers using semi-directed interviews supplemented by at-sea observer data. Linear and non-linear regression analyses revealed significant relationships between depth use of cod and sea surface temperature (SST) as well as thermal stratification. Moreover, habitat use was related to SST and residence depth of cod. Areas deeper than 15 m were favoured from late December until March during low SST and a mixed water column (spawning) and also from July until August during high SST and strong thermal stratification (summer aestivation). Shallower areas were favoured during the rest of the year. The depth and habitat use displayed distinct seasonal up- and downslope movements of cod. This study highlights the importance of shallow-water and structured habitats for cod in the WBS and the value of local knowledge held by fishers for a better understanding of the distributional dynamics of important marine resource populations.;"[Funk, Steffen; Temming, Axel; Moellmann, Christian] Univ Hamburg, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil CEN, Inst Marine Ecosyst & Fisheries Sci, Grosse Elbstr 133, D-22767 Hamburg, Germany; [Krumme, Uwe] Thunen Inst Baltic Sea Fisheries, Alter Hafen Sud 2, D-18069 Rostock, Germany";;Funk, S (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil CEN, Inst Marine Ecosyst & Fisheries Sci, Grosse Elbstr 133, D-22767 Hamburg, Germany.;steffen.funk@uni-hamburg.de;Mollmann, Christian/C-4788-2011;"Mollmann, Christian/0000-0001-9161-6342; Funk, Steffen/0000-0001-5973-5624";"European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) of the European Union (EU) [2017/1004]; BONUS BLUEWEBS project - BONUS [03F0772A]; EUEuropean Commission; Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission; Projekttrager Julich (PtJ), Germany; State Education Development Agency of Latvia; National Centre for Research and Development, PolandNational Centre for Research & Development, Poland; Swedish Research Council FormasSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas; Federal Ministry of Education and Research of GermanyFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [01LC1826B]";The at-sea sampling was partly funded by the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) of the European Union (EU) under the Data Collection Framework (DCF, Regulation 2017/1004 of the European Parliament and of the Council).

To achieve these objectives, current fishery data collection programmes should widen their objectives to include the collection of ecosystem descriptors to effectively take advantage of funding and human resources in relation to fisheries monitoring already in place. From an ecological perspective, fishing discards are food subsidies unnaturally available that can profoundly impact the life history traits and population dynamics of seabirds, as well as community structure. In 2015, we took advantage of the Data Collection Framework (DCF) programme, monitoring the Basque trawling fleet, to monitor seabird abundance associated with trawlers as an additional task to be performed by the observers. The main objectives were (1) to develop a standard protocol from an interdisciplinary expert committee, (2) to obtain baseline information of seabird association with trawlers to be able to track changes and (3) to understand seabird abundance in relation to discard facilitation processes based on environmental and fishing parameters. Based on the developed standard protocol, more than 21 species of seabirds were recorded in 241 fishing hauls in the Bay of Biscay (ICES areas 8abd). This biogeographic area is an important migratory flyway and wintering area, where maximum number of seabirds attending trawlers were recorded between December and April (2015-2019). Based on Generalised Linear Models, seabird abundance was higher in multiple situations: harsher environmental conditions, less available discards, shallower areas, increased period of discard availability, higher number of trawlers simultaneously operating in the same fishing ground, in addition to the months of February and April. The core discarding ground was located in the outer French shelf between the latitudinal range of 44.5 degrees N and 46 degrees N, especially for otter trawl fishing. Our approach puts into value the seabird counts that the observers of the DCF can perform systematically, collecting relevant information on the effect of trawling on other biodiversity components such as seabirds. This information will be critical to respond to the application of the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy regarding the effect of the Landing Obligation that seeks fishing sustainability.;"[Louzao, Maite; Ruiz, Jon; Oyarzabal, Inaki; Basterretxea, Mikel; Pedrajas, Arkaitz; Mugerza, Arnaitz; Krug, Inigo; Cotano, Unai; Mugerza, Estanis; Zarauz, Lucia; Santurtun, Marina] AZTI, Basque Res & Technol Alliance BRTA, Marine Res, Portualdea Zg 20110, Pasaia, Spain";;Louzao, M (corresponding author), AZTI, Basque Res & Technol Alliance BRTA, Marine Res, Portualdea Zg 20110, Pasaia, Spain.;mlouzao@azti.es;/ABH-2880-2020;"/0000-0003-1477-7059; Ruiz, Jon/0000-0003-0717-0136; Mugerza, Estanis/0000-0003-4175-8750";"Ramon y Cajal programme of MINECO [RYC-2012-09897]; Department of Economic Development and Competitiveness of the Basque Government; European Commission Data Collection Framework";We want to thank the crew, skippers and owners of the Basque fleet of Ondarroa for their collaboration in facilitating the onboard sampling and data collection.

Haddock is an important commercial species widespread in the North Atlantic, but few studies related to quality have been carried out on this species. We studied the levels of external damages on haddock captured with a demersal trawl in the Northeast Atlantic. Further, we investigated to what extent the compulsory sorting grid and diamond mesh codend gear configuration employed in this trawl fishery is responsible for the external damages observed during the capture process. We evaluated external damages on 563 haddock captured over 22 hauls. In general, the results showed that catching haddock without any gear inflicted damages using demersal trawls is challenging. However, the results also showed that the severity of most damages is low and the probability to catch haddock with no external damage can be significantly increased removing the grid and changing codend design.;"[Sistiaga, Manu; Herrmann, Bent; Gjosund, Svein Helge] SINTEF Ocean, Brattorkaia 17C, N-7010 Trondheim, Norway; [Sistiaga, Manu] Inst Marine Res, Postbox 1870 Nordnes, N-5817 Bergen, Norway; [Herrmann, Bent; Brinkhof, Jesse; Larsen, Roger B.; Jacques, Nadine] Arctic Univ Norway, UiT, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Santos, Juan] Thunen Inst Baltic Sea Fisheries, Alter Hafen Sud 2, D-18069 Rostock, Germany";;Sistiaga, M (corresponding author), SINTEF Ocean, Brattorkaia 17C, N-7010 Trondheim, Norway.;manu.sistiaga@hi.no;Larsen, Roger B./AAY-4314-2021;Jacques, Nadine/0000-0001-6981-3825;"Norwegian Research Council (NRC)Research Council of Norway [268388/E40]; Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries (NDF) [18/17046]; Arctic University of Norway";We thank the crew of the RV Helmer Hanssen and Elsa Cuende, Hermann Pettersen, Ivan Tatone, Kristine Cerbule, and John-Terje Eilertsen for their valuable help during the sea trials.

In addition, the dynamics behind strategy selection should be investigated and understood, since they are likely to affect the status of the stocks. This study applies artificial neural networks to identify the main strategies characterizing the fishing activity of Italian trawlers operating in the Central Mediterranean during the period 2009-2016. Moreover, the rationale driving fishers' choice is modelled using General Additive Models (to investigate the role of external factors) and Conditional Logit (to investigate the interaction among fishers). Five strategies were identified together with the potential effects on some key stocks which, in turn, determine the fishers' preference towards alternative strategies. Results suggest that both external factors and interactions are relevant in driving fishers' behavior, and provide some potentially useful insights for the set-up of management strategies in which the adaptation of fishers to biological and economic factors are explicitly considered.;"[De Angelis, Paola; D'Andrea, Lorenzo; Franceschini, Simone; Cataudella, Stefano; Russo, Tommaso] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Biol, Lab Expt Ecol & Aquacultura, Rome, Italy";;Russo, T (corresponding author), Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Biol, Lab Expt Ecol & Aquacultura, Rome, Italy.;tommaso.russo@uniroma2.it;Russo, Tommaso/C-6157-2014;Russo, Tommaso/0000-0003-4047-959X;Italian Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies (MAFFP);This study was realized as part of a PhD Thesis within the research activities for the application of the Italian National Program for Data Collection in the Fisheries Sector supported by the Italian Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies (MAFFP).

Trammel nets, in particular, have key advantages such as their ease of use and handling and high capture efficiency for numerous commercial species. However, they entail high discard rates (5-44% of the total catch) connected to high mortality, thus exerting an adverse impact on benthic communities, besides catching individuals of commercial species under the minimum conservation reference size (MCRS) and specimens of protected species. Fish pots are seen as alternative and a more sustainable gear type that allow reducing discards in SSFs. In this study, a collapsible pot was tested at three coastal sites in the north-western Adriatic Sea (GFCM GSA 17) to compare its catch efficiency with that of the local traditional trammel nets. Data analysis demonstrated a similar catch efficiency for the commercial species, both among sites and as a whole. Moreover, the trammel net caught a larger amount of discards, both in terms of species number and of CPUEW. The catch comparison study involved the two most abundant landed species, common cuttlefish Sepia officinalis and annular sea bream Diplodus annularis. The pots were more effective for S. officinalis, whereas the trammel net was more effective for the shorter length classes for D. annularis, which were mostly under the MCRS (12 cm). The innovative pots could provide a valuable alternative to the trammel nets traditionally used in the Adriatic Sea, at least in certain areas and periods. Their main advantages include that they do not require a different rigging and they can be used without bait, while their foldable design allows large numbers to be easily loaded on board SSF vessels. The results of this pilot study indicate that pots can achieve the objectives of reducing discards and bycatch in SSFs without penalizing the catch of commercial species.;"[Petetta, Andrea; Bargione, Giada] Univ Bologna, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci, Bologna, Italy; [Petetta, Andrea; Vasapollo, Claudio; Virgili, Massimo; Bargione, Giada; Lucchetti, Alessandro] Italian Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Biol Resources & Marine Biotechnol IRBIM, Ancona, Italy";;"Petetta, A (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci, Bologna, Italy.; Petetta, A; Lucchetti, A (corresponding author), Italian Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Biol Resources & Marine Biotechnol IRBIM, Ancona, Italy.";"andrea.petetta@irbim.cnr.it; alessandro.lucchetti@cnr.it";"Vasapollo, Claudio/A-4456-2014; Lucchetti, Alessandro/AAV-7188-2020; Petetta, Andrea/AAD-4089-2020";"Vasapollo, Claudio/0000-0002-5381-6690; Lucchetti, Alessandro/0000-0001-8418-9848; Petetta, Andrea/0000-0003-1976-8995";LIFE Financial Instrument of the European Community, Tartalife Project -Reduction of sea turtle mortality in professional fishing [LIFE12NAT/IT/000937];This study was conducted with the contribution of the LIFE Financial Instrument of the European Community, Tartalife Project -Reduction of sea turtle mortality in professional fishing (LIFE12NAT/IT/000937).

We use life-history parameters and knowledge of fish shape and habitat to estimate the sensitivity of 270 species in the Northeast Atlantic to demersal trawling and compare sensitivity to the most recent IUCN categorization. Species classified as threatened were on average significantly more sensitive to trawling than other species. Using trawl surveys in European Atlantic waters from 36 degrees N to 62 degrees N, we estimated indicators of abundance of 31 highly sensitive species and compared changes in abundance to sensitivity, management measures, and value of landings. The abundance of 23 of the 31 sensitive species increased after year 2000 with 14 of the species showing increases significant at the 5% level. The increases were not due to specific management measures, as less than half of the species were covered by catch limits. Furthermore, sensitivity or value of landings was not related to trends in abundance. Three species (Atlantic wolf-fish, tusk and starry ray) declined significantly. These species are all at their southern distributional limit in the North Sea. Synthesis and applications. We recommend monitoring the development of sensitive species to identify species under pressure and allow rapid management actions before species enter the IUCN threatened category.

Acoustic and optical methods visualised the morphological changes induced by experimental beam trawling, showing the flattening and homogenisation of surface sediments. Video transects found a 94% decrease in epibenthos in beam trawled sediments compared to an untrawled control site and a 74% decrease in untrawled sediments of the same transect. Box core samples taken 5.5 h, 29 h and 75 h after trawling detected a downward trend in infaunal densities and species richness that continued after the initial impact with small-bodied and juvenile taxa being especially prone to depletion. Data from shallow sediment samples showed trawl resilience in large mud shrimps and evidence of their upward movement towards the sediment surface after disturbance. Both trawl gears induced significant changes to infaunal communities, with no differential effect between the two gears.

In order to delineate when, where and how marine ecosystems have been perturbed and to implement ecosystem-based management strategies, the identification and investigation of the spatial and temporal distribution of fishing effort and the fleet dynamics play a key role. In this context, Geospatial Technologies such as the Automatic Identification System (AIS) could represent a useful tool. The aim of the present work is to reconstruct spatial and temporal patterns of the trawl fishing activities in the Northern and Central Adriatic Sea (GSA17), by using AIS data. High-resolution maps of fishing effort per fishing gear allowed us to identify the main fishing grounds and seasonal variations, for the small and large trawlers, but also for the Rapido and mid-water pair trawlers, during the period 2015-2016. Moreover, the effects of the closure of the Pomo Pit in terms of fishing effort redistribution and possible effects of the enlargement of the ban for trawling to the 3-6 nm area have been explored. Obtained results highlighted the importance to take into account the spatial and temporal dynamics of the fishing effort within the context of the implementation of an ecosystem approach management in the study area.;"[Russo, Elisabetta; Monti, Marco Anelli; Raffaeta, Alessandra; Silvestri, Claudio; Pranovi, Fabio] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, Venice, Italy; [Mangano, M.

We used 5465 paired trap-video samples collected along the southeast US Atlantic coast in 2015-2018 to estimate trap catchabilities of 6 reef fish species (gray triggerfish Balistes capriscus, red porgy Pagrus pagrus, vermilion snapper Rhomboplites aurorubens, black sea bass Centropristis striata, red snapper Lutjanus campechanus, white grunt Haemulon plumierii) as the ratio of trap catch to standardized site abundance from corresponding videos. Species-specific trap catchabilities were then related to 2 primary predictor variables: water temperature and percent of the visible bottom consisting of rocky substrate. Water temperature strongly influenced trap catchabilities for all species after standardizing for all other variables. The 4 warm-water species displayed strong positive relationships between catchability and temperature; of these species, the smallest absolute increase in catchability occurred for vermilion snapper (0.0 at similar to 14 degrees C to 0.05 at similar to 28 degrees C) and the largest occurred for white grunt (0.0 at similar to 14 degrees C to 0.49 at similar to 28 degrees C). The 2 cooler-water species displayed either a dome-shaped (red porgy) or negative relationship (black sea bass) between catchability and temperature. Furthermore, trap catchabilities for all species declined substantially (42-80%) as the percent hard bottom of the site increased. Only when catchability is properly accounted for can results be considered unbiased and subsequent management advice be considered accurate.";"[Bacheler, Nathan M.; Shertzer, Kyle W.] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, 101 Pivers Isl Rd, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA";;Bacheler, NM (corresponding author), Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, 101 Pivers Isl Rd, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA.;nate.bacheler@noaa.gov;;;National Marine Fisheries Service;We thank the captains and crew of the RV `Savannah', RV `Palmetto', SRVx `Sand Tiger', and NOAA Ship `Pisces', SERFS staff members, and numerous volunteers for making field work possible.

The age structure of the catch is estimated by sampling fish for otoliths collection in a length-stratified manner from trawl hauls. Since age determination of fish is costly and time consuming, only a fraction of fish is sampled for age from a larger sample of the length distribution and an age- length key (ALK) is then used to obtain the age distribution. In this study, we evaluate ALK estimators for calculating the indices of abundance-at-age, with and without the assumption of constant age-length structures over relatively large areas. We show that the ALK estimators give similar point estimates of abundance-at-age and yield similar performance with respect to precision. We also quantify the uncertainty of indices of abundance and examine the effect of reducing the number of fish sampled for age determination on precision. For various subsampling strategies of otoliths collection, we show that one fish per 5-cm-length group width per trawl haul is sufficient and the total number of fish subsampled for age from trawl surveys could be reduced by at least half (50%) without appreciable loss in precision.;"[Jourdain, N.

Instead of being discarded, the fish were assessed and monitored in on-land observation tanks for 14 days. For each gear, a Weibull mixture model was fitted to the data to estimate survival probabilities, including the uncertainties from the haul selection and conditions of the captivity experiment, and to determine which biological, environmental and operational factors influence survival. Generally, fish caught by the trawler showed lower survival (44%, 95%-confidence interval: 37-52%) than those caught by the seiner (78%, 95%confidence interval: 67-87%).

Fouling organisms settle on the cage nets over time, close the mesh openings, and cause unwanted weight gain. In order to prevent this problem, fishing nets or cages are treated with antifouling paints. Therefore, there is a great need for developing eco-friendly antifouling biocides since negative ecological effects have been proven for the current antifouling biocides and paints. In this study, it was aimed to take advantage of the slow and sustained release of microcapsule technology. For this purpose, econea active agent (an eco-friendly antifouling chemical) was encapsulated with spray-dryer method, carried out capsule optimization studies, and impregnated to the ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene fishing nets with two different binders as polyurethane and acrylic. Fishing nets, which transferred microcapsules, were compared with a commercial copper oxide-based dye. Microcapsule-treated and untreated net samples were immersed in a marine ecosystem next to an aquaculture zone for six months in the Aegean Sea. Fouling organisms on nets were observed by taking underwater photographs at periodic intervals. Physical tests (tensile strength, variation in mass) were performed on the nets before and after the treatment with microcapsules. Solidity of the nets and analyses of fouling organisms were examined after the field study. These results show that copper-free eco-friendly antifouling microcapsules are effective against the fouling mechanism. The novel ecofriendly formulation has promising results, and slightly dissolving versions of studied ecofriendly microcapsules could be an alternative for copper-based antifouling biocides.;"[Kartal, Gulsah Ekin; Sariisik, Ayse Merih] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Text Engn, TR-35397 Izmir, Turkey";;Kartal, GE (corresponding author), Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Text Engn, TR-35397 Izmir, Turkey.;gulsah.kartal@deu.edu.tr;"KARTAL, Gulsah Ekin/S-7023-2016; sariisik, merih/P-9842-2019";"KARTAL, Gulsah Ekin/0000-0001-7364-7049; SARIISIK, AYSE MERIH/0000-0003-0402-2955"; [TUB ITAK-BIDEB 2211];The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article : TUB ITAK-BIDEB 2211.;32;1;1;5;22;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;1528-0837;1530-8057;J IND TEXT;J.

Sustainability science literature suggests that the persistence of unsustainable fisheries can be understood as a social-ecological trap. Few studies have explicitly acknowledged the role of historical legacies for the development of social-ecological traps. Here, we investigate why fishers sometimes end up in social-ecological traps through a reconstruction of the historical interplay between fishers' motivations, capacities, and opportunities to fish. We focus on the case of a Swedish fishery targeting the critically endangered European eel (Anguilla Anguilla) in the Baltic Sea. We performed the case study using a unique quantitative data set of social and ecological variables that spans over eight decades, in combination with earlier literature and interviews with fishers and fisheries experts. Our analysis reveals that Swedish archipelago fishers are highly dependent on the eel to maintain their fishing livelihood. The dependence on the eel originates from the 1930s, when fishers chose to intensify fishing for this species to ensure future incomes. The dependence persisted over time because of a series of changes, including improved eel fishing technology, heightened competition over catch, reduced opportunities to target other species, implementation of an eel fishing license, and the fishers' capacity and motivation to deal with dwindling catches. Our study confirms that social-ecological traps are path-dependent processes. In terms of management, this finding means that it becomes progressively more difficult to escape the social-ecological trap with the passage of time. The longer entrapment endures, the more effort it takes and the bigger change it requires to return to a situation where fishers have more options so that unsustainable practices can be avoided. We conclude that fisheries policies need to be based on the premise that unsustainable fishing emerges through multiple rather than single causes.;"[Bjorkvik, Emma; Boonstra, Wiebren J.; Hentati-Sundberg, Jonas] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden; [Hentati-Sundberg, Jonas] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Inst Marine Res, Dept Aquat Resources, Lysekil, Sweden";;Bjorkvik, E (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden.;;"Boonstra, Wiebren J./H-9447-2019; Hentati-Sundberg, Jonas/N-6535-2017";"Boonstra, Wiebren J./0000-0002-1191-0574; Hentati-Sundberg, Jonas/0000-0002-3201-9262";"Nordforsk; FORMASSwedish Research Council Formas [2013-1293]";We are grateful for the time and information we received from the fishers and fisheries experts interviewed for this study.

We assessed with trawl net the composition and abundance of megafauna, litter, and litter-fouling communities in the soft bottoms of the National Interest Priority Site (NIPS) of Bagnoli-Coroglio (Gulf of Naples, Tyrrhenian Sea) at different depths. The megafauna accounted for 3444 specimens referred to 133 taxa (91 invertebrates and 42 fishes), for a biomass of similar to 102 kg and including species of wide ecological and commercial interest. Metrics of community structure yielded high values. The NIPS, hence, is characterized by a high biodiversity. Litter accounted for 3590 items, mostly in plastic and ranging between 10< x <= 20 cm, for a weight of similar to 260 kg, with values of 299.2 item/km(2) and 21.67 kg/km(2). The putative origin of most items was land-based (83.6%), whereas sea-based litter accounted for 16.4%. More than 50% of the litter items found showed colonization by invertebrates and/or molluscan egg masses. Marine benthic litter, thus, locally constitutes a complex issue since litter items hosted complex communities of fouling organisms. Future remediation procedures should take the resident NIPS biota into account and not disrupt the environmental balance of the area.;"[Crocetta, Fabio; Riginella, Emilio; Tanduo, Valentina; Balestrieri, Liliana; Rizzo, Lucia] Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, Dept Integrat Marine Ecol, I-80121 Naples, Italy; [Lezzi, Marco] ARPAT Reg Agcy Environm Protect Tuscany, Via Vittorio Veneto 27, I-56127 Pisa, Italy";;Crocetta, F (corresponding author), Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, Dept Integrat Marine Ecol, I-80121 Naples, Italy.;fabio.crocetta@szn.it;Rizzo, Lucia/AAZ-7575-2021;"Rizzo, Lucia/0000-0002-0893-0582; Riginella, Emilio/0000-0002-1442-8310; Crocetta, Fabio/0000-0002-2800-3735";"project ABBaCo [C62F16000170001]; project ADViSE [PG/2018/0494374]";This study was supported by the projects ABBaCo (C62F16000170001) (FC, ER, LR) and ADViSE (PG/2018/0494374) (FC).

However, the ability to detect these impacts over large spatial scales can be obscured by various complicating factors, such as community adaptation to disturbance and co-varying environmental conditions. An ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management therefore requires ecological indicators which can 'disentangle' trawling effects from other natural and human drivers, and respond effectively to shifts in ecological quality. We collected benthic macrofaunal samples at 21 sites across a Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus fishing ground in the Kattegat, and separated the benthic community into small (1-4 mm) and large ( > 4 mm) size fractions. Four taxonomic indicators (total density, species density, Shannon diversity, and biomass) and four functional indicators (functional diversity, functional richness, functional evenness, and functional dispersion) were calculated based on each size fraction, and the two fractions combined (pooled community). Here, we compare the ability of these indicators to detect trawling impacts across size categories. We show that indicators derived from large macrofauna were highly effective in this regard, and were less influenced by other environmental drivers, such as depth, sediment grain size, bottom current velocity, salinity, and temperature. This suggests that the taxonomic and functional characteristics of benthic communities display a size-dependent sensitivity to trawling disturbance, and therefore community metrics based on large benthic macrofauna may provide useful indicators. By contrast, indicators derived from the small fraction performed poorly, and those based on the pooled community demonstrated a varied ability to detect trawling. Small macrofauna are typically characterised by high density, diversity, and population growth rates, and their relative resilience to trawling may mask the response of the more sensitive macrofauna. This highlights an underlying issue with calculating indicators based on the whole benthic community. The approach outline here is easily applied, improves indicator performance, and has the potential to reduce laboratory workloads due to the fewer taxa and individuals required for analyses.;"[McLaverty, Ciaran; Eigaard, Ole R.; Gislason, Henrik; Bastardie, Francois; Brooks, Mollie E.; Dinesen, Grete E.] Natl Inst Aquat Resources, DTU Aqua, Lyngby, Denmark; [Jonsson, Patrik] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Inst Marine Res, Dept Aquat Resources, S-45330 Lysekil, Sweden; [Lehmann, Andreas] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res, Dusternbrooker Weg 20, D-24105 Kiel, Germany";;"McLaverty, C (corresponding author), Natl Inst Aquat Resources, DTU Aqua, Lyngby, Denmark.; McLaverty, C (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources DTU Aqua, Bldg 201,Room 049, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.";cimc@aqua.dtu.dk;Brooks, Mollie Elizabeth/AAM-5509-2021;"Brooks, Mollie Elizabeth/0000-0001-6963-8326; Eigaard, Ole Ritzau/0000-0003-4213-2397; McLaverty, Ciaran/0000-0002-4079-148X; Dinesen, Grete E./0000-0002-6385-1238; Bastardie, Francois/0000-0002-2669-6179";"Danish Fisheries Agency; Ministry of Environment and Food of Denmark, through the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) via the project Udvikling af baeredygtig forvaltning af folsomme habitater og arter i Kattegat [33113-B-16-024]; DTU Aqua";We thank the captains and crew of the DTU Aqua RV Havfisken: Aage Thaarup, Rene Nyholm Erlandsen, Soren Larsen Gronby, and Jens Holm, and thank Eva Maria F.

For a 31-year time span (1985-2015), we provide a gridded dataset of the spatial distribution of total international otter and beam trawling effort, with a resolution of 0.5 degrees latitude by 1 degrees longitude, over the North Sea. The dataset was largely reconstructed using compiled effort data from seven fishing effort time series, each covering shorter time spans and only some of the countries fishing the North Sea. For the years where effort data for particular countries were missing, the series was complemented using estimated (modelled) effort data. This new, long-term and large-scale trawling dataset may serve the wider scientific community, as well as those involved with policy and management, as a valuable information source on fishing pressure in a large marine ecosystem which is heavily impacted but which simultaneously provides a wealth of ecosystem services to society.";"[Couce, Elena; Schratzberger, Michaela; Engelhard, Georg H.] Cefas, Pakefield Rd, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England; [Schratzberger, Michaela; Engelhard, Georg H.] Univ East Anglia, CCSUS, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England";;Couce, E (corresponding author), Cefas, Pakefield Rd, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England.;elena.couce@cefas.co.uk;;"Couce, Elena/0000-0002-3945-462X; Schratzberger, Michaela/0000-0002-4973-6698";"Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs of the UK (Defra)Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) [SLA44]; DefraDepartment for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) [NE/L003279/1]; Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/L003279/1]";This research has been supported by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs of the UK (Defra) via project SLA44 (Marine Biodiversity Advice) and jointly by Defra and by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) via grant NE/L003279/1 (Marine Ecosystems Research Programme).;45;7;7;0;6;COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH;GOTTINGEN;BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY;1866-3508;1866-3516;EARTH SYST SCI DATA;Earth Syst.

From this object of study we can disaggregate multiple aspects of this activity from different points of view (productive, economical, political and social). This paper focuses on the analysis of tuna traps from the Iberian Peninsula (Valencia and Catalonia) in XVIth and XVIIth centuries. In this chronology, fisheries contributed to the economic and cultural development of the regions that have been studied, but also to the western Mediterranean Sea as a whole. For this reason, it is important to compare these fishing areas with those from the most important fishing regions, especially the islands of Sicily and Sardinia and the south of the Iberian Peninsula. On the other hand, they also have to be related to other regions at an international level, so as to know the impact of these traps in each territory, in addition to the commercial and cultural relations that were designed to take advantage of sea resources. This method is based on the study of primary documentary sources kept in state and private archives of the mentioned regions.;[Vidal Bonavila, Judit] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Tarragona, Spain;;Bonavila, JV (corresponding author), Univ Rovira & Virgili, Tarragona, Spain.;judit.vidal@urv.cat;;;;;52;0;0;0;0;UNIV CATOLICA NORTE;CORREO SAN PEDRO DE ATACAMA II REGION;CASILLA 17, CORREO SAN PEDRO DE ATACAMA II REGION, 00000, CHILE;0718-1043;;ESTUD ATACAMENOS;Estud.

Nowadays, the systematic collection of catch and effort data from coastal small-scale fisheries has gradually been launched as well, e.g., in the Baltic Sea. The data from coastal fisheries is typically collected in monthly logbooks. We demonstrate that raw CPUEs, CPUEs based on subsetted data and CPUE indices based on linear mixed models (LMMs) from coastal gill-net fishery data covering a 20-year period yield different results on trends in abundance. The use of advanced counting methods is recommended to reduce the amount of the annual variation not attributable to changes in abundance. Thereafter, CPUE indices based on the monthly logbook data can produce valuable and cost-effective information on fish abundance.;"[Lappalainen, Antti; Soderkultalahti, Pirkko; Heikkinen, Juha] Nat Resources Inst Finland, Latokartanonkaari 9, Helsinki 00790, Finland; [Hyvonen, Juha] Nat Resources Inst Finland, Ounasjoentie 6, Rovaniemi 96200, Finland";;Lappalainen, A (corresponding author), Nat Resources Inst Finland, Latokartanonkaari 9, Helsinki 00790, Finland.;antti.lappalainen@luke.fi;;;Natural Resource Institute Finland;We would like to thank Dr. Outi Heikinheimo, Dr. Mikko Olin, Dr. Mika Rahikainen and Dr. Sanna Kuningas for their valuable comments on the manuscript.

We present an approach to predict their effects on benthic communities, and use the approach to estimate the state, the biomass relative to carrying capacity, of the Baltic Sea at the local, habitat, and regional scale. Responses to both pressures are expected to depend on the longevity of fauna, which is predicted from benthic data from 1558 locations. We find that communities in low-salinity regions mostly consist of short-lived species, which are, in our model, more resilient than those of the saline areas. The model predicts that in 14% of the Baltic Sea region benthic biomass is reduced by at least 50%, whereas an additional 8% of the region has reductions of 10-50%. The effects of hypoxia occur over larger spatial scales and lead to a low state of especially deep habitats. The approach is based on a simple characterization of the benthic community, which comes with high uncertainty, but allows for the identification of benthic habitats that are at greatest risk and prioritization of management actions at the regional scale. This information supports the development of sustainable approaches to manage impact of human activities on benthic ecosystems.;"[van Denderen, P.

In this fishery a beam trawl is pulled along the seafloor, potentially affecting organisms living on and in the seabed. Because the effect by the trawl used in the shrimp fishery is unclear, has long been debated, and hardly studied to date, we carried out an experimental study to test short to medium term effects of the fishery on the benthic community in an area with a decadal long fishery. The study consisted of two complementing parts: one experiment focussed on the effect of a single fishing event in 15 different areas throughout the distribution area of shrimp fishery along the coast and in the Wadden Sea; in another experiment we measured the dose-response relationship between fishing intensity and the benthic community in one area in the Wadden Sea. Unfortunately, the first experiment was severely hampered by unplanned fishing by fishermen. Instead of the originally planned BACI design with 15 replicates, the first experiment was analysed by correlating actual fishing intensity and benthos community parameters. We found a negative relationship between fishing pressure and the change in number of species from pre- (T0) and post-fishing (T1, eight weeks later), but not in total density or Pielou's evenness. In the second experiment the change between T0 and T1, ten weeks later and T2, eight months later) in Pielou's evenness was negatively related to fishing pressure. The change in total density and the number of species were unrelated to fishing intensity. The pattern in evenness was primarily due to the positive relationship of the change of Ensis leei with fishing pressure. For eight of the ten most common individual macrofauna species, there was no relationship between their development and fishing pressure, while for two species the change in density showed a negative relationship with fishing pressure in the T0-T1 (Ascidia sp.) or T0-T2 comparison (Cerastoderma edule). We interpret the observed response in Ensis leei as their ability to relocate and quickly colonise space, that became vacant because the original inhabitants were disturbed, removed or died. Especially this last finding, that an apparently mobile opportunistic species is able to colonise vacant space is a fishery-related mechanism that adds to the understanding of the potential effect of shrimp fisheries.";"[Tulp, Ingrid; Glorius, Sander; Rippen, Anneke; Craeymeersch, Johan] Wageningen Univ, Wageningen Marine Res, POB 68, NL-1970 AB Ijmuiden, Netherlands; [Looije, Daphne] Maritime Res Inst Netherlands MARIN, POB 28, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Rippen, Anneke] Altenburg & Wymenga, Suderwei 2, NL-9269 TZ Feanwalden, Netherlands; [Looije, Daphne] Quantitat Methods, POB 414, NL-5600 AK Eindhoven, Netherlands";;Tulp, I (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Wageningen Marine Res, POB 68, NL-1970 AB Ijmuiden, Netherlands.;Ingrid.tulp@wur.nl;;;"Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food quality (LNV); Dutch Fisheries Organisation (Vissersbond); EU project BENTHIS";This project was financed by the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food quality (LNV), the Dutch Fisheries Organisation (Vissersbond) and the EU project BENTHIS.

The deep-water rose prawn, Parapenaeus longirostris, and the short nose green eye, Chlorophthalmus agassizi, are identified as its main prey items. We used stomach contents as a proxy of prey availability, thus reflecting the local species abundance in the warm, oligotrophic environment of the south eastern Levant. Current models predict increasing temperatures and oligotrophy in the Mediterranean Sea. The results of this study depicting the diet of the Levantine population of L. budegassa, which varies from other Mediterranean populations, could indicate possible Mediterranean-wide shifts in prey distribution and abundance driven by climate change and anthropogenic disturbance. In addition, we augment the knowledge regarding the species' feeding ecology, especially regarding possible sex and size dissimilarity. We propose the use of diet analyses from non-selective predators like L. budegassa as a mean to identify changes in community compositions and differences among communities. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To reduce catches of small shrimp, we studied the effect of trawl belly length on size selectivity in November 2017 and June 2018 onboard 15 and 27 m double-rigged shrimp trawlers. The selectivity of the vessels' standard trawl was compared with a trawl differing only in the belly length, being 37% shorter. The trawls had 40 mm bottom panels and cod ends of 35 mm mesh sizes. Eleven and 14 hauls were made, respectively, in 2017 aboard the 15 m vessel and in 2018 aboard the 27 m vessel. The trawls fished shrimp above 19 mm carapace length equally, while catch rates of shrimp below 15.5-16 mm carapace length in the shorter trawl were more than halved. The results were consistent between the two vessels. In short, modifying trawl length is a simple design modification that can reduce catches of small shrimp.

In European waters, chondrichthyes have become a focus of conservation actions due to the abundance declines of several species. In the present study, fishery independent data obtained from the Mediterranean International Trawl Surveys (MEDITS) in the Aegean and E. Ionian Seas (eastern Mediterranean) were coupled with bottom trawl fishing effort data obtained from vessel monitoring systems (VMS) in order to evaluate the effect of fishing on biomass variations of demersal chondrichthyan species. The study focused on commonly captured species such as Raja clavata, Galeus melastomus, Scyliorhinus canicula and Squalus spp, as well as to the total chondrichthyan biomass. The effect of fishing effort on biomass indices, expressed in terms of kg per square km of swept area, was examined by means of Generalized Additive Model techniques, using also the sampling position, year and depth as co-variates. Overall findings suggested a biomass decline of chondrichthyan species with increasing fishing effort. Nevertheless, it was also found that certain species (e.g G. melastomus in both areas and S. canicula in the Aegean Sea) can withstand fishing pressure and it is likely that discard survival rates, depth preferences and fisheries exploitation patterns, are the main drivers explaining variations regarding the impact of fishing on the different stocks.;"[Peristeraki, Panagiota; Tserpes, George] Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Marine Biol Resources & Inland Waters, POB 2214, Iraklion, Crete, Greece; [Peristeraki, Panagiota] Univ Crete, Biol Dept, Iraklion, Crete, Greece; [Kavadas, Stefanos; Stergiou, Kostantinos, I] Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Marine Biol Resources & Inland Waters, Athens, Greece; [Kallianiotis, Argyris] Fisheries Res Inst, Kavala, Greece; [Stergiou, Kostantinos, I] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Biol, Dept Zool, Lab Ichthyol, Thessaloniki, Greece";;Peristeraki, P (corresponding author), Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Marine Biol Resources & Inland Waters, POB 2214, Iraklion, Crete, Greece.;notap@hcmr.gr;Tserpes, George/L-6201-2013;"Tserpes, George/0000-0001-9052-4091; Kavadas, Stefanos/0000-0003-3473-9084";;;97;5;5;1;19;ELSEVIER;AMSTERDAM;RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0165-7836;1872-6763;FISH RES;Fish Res.;JAN;2020;221;;;;;;;105367;10.1016/j.fishres.2019.105367;;;13;Fisheries;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Fisheries;JN4NA;WOS:000496874700004;;;;;10/01/2022

Since the conservation of these species has become a priority, fishery scientists are faced with the challenge of reducing incidental catch, which entails high rates of mortality. Among the species threatened by fishing activities, the loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) is a charismatic species considered as vulnerable at the global scale. In the Mediterranean Sea trawl nets are the gears with the highest probability of catching protected species incidentally. A new flexible Turtle Excluder Device (TED) was tested for the first time on commercial bottom trawlers to assess its effectiveness in reducing bycatch in the Mediterranean Sea. Analysis of the total catches of the hauls made with and without the TED showed that the difference in terms of weight was not significant. The catch of the main commercial species showed similar rates without a significant loss of size (i.e. total length) with the exception of the largest anglerfish (Lophius spp.). The bycatch of control nets included mostly rays and sharks, but never turtles, although the authors learned from the crews of other vessels operating in the same areas at the time of the trials that they had caught some loggerhead turtles. Our study demonstrates that TED scan be adopted without significantly affecting commercial catch. This informs fishers and managers for a practical and effective means that may reduce the bycatch of threatened species in coastal Mediterranean demersal multispecies fisheries. The measures involving gear modifications require significant investment but they are technically feasible and are capable of improving the conservation prospects of these endangered species. Besides ensuring normal earnings, the TED induced a significant reduction of debris and litter in the codend, thus reducing catch sorting time and improving catch quality.;"[Vasapollo, Claudio; Virgili, Massimo; Petetta, Andrea; Bargione, Giada; Sala, Antonello; Lucchetti, Alessandro] Univ Bologna, Inst Biol Resources & Marine Biotechnol Irb, Natl Res Council CNR, Dept Biol, Piazza Porta San Donato, Bologna, Italy; [Vasapollo, Claudio; Virgili, Massimo; Petetta, Andrea; Bargione, Giada; Sala, Antonello; Lucchetti, Alessandro] Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Biol Resources & Marine Biotechnol IRBIM, Ancona, Italy; [Petetta, Andrea; Bargione, Giada] Univ Bologna, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci, Piazza Porta San Donato, Bologna, Italy";;Vasapollo, C (corresponding author), Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Biol Resources & Marine Biotechnol IRBIM, Ancona, Italy.;c.vasapollo@irbim.cnr.it;"Sala, Antonello/B-8517-2016; Petetta, Andrea/AAD-4089-2020; Lucchetti, Alessandro/AAV-7188-2020; Vasapollo, Claudio/A-4456-2014";"Sala, Antonello/0000-0001-7066-1152; Petetta, Andrea/0000-0003-1976-8995; Lucchetti, Alessandro/0000-0001-8418-9848; Vasapollo, Claudio/0000-0002-5381-6690";LIFE financial instrument of the European Community, TartaLife Project -Reduction of sea turtle mortality in professional fishing [LIFE12NAT/IT/000937];AL received fundings by LIFE financial instrument of the European Community, TartaLife Project -Reduction of sea turtle mortality in professional fishing (LIFE12NAT/IT/000937).

To avoid overcrowding fish before being released, regulations have been implemented in the Northeast Atlantic mackerel and herring fisheries that limit the proportion of the seine that can be retrieved before catches are released. However, it is yet unknown how seine volume, and thus fish density, relates to proportion of seine retrieved. In this study, we have estimated the in-water volume of purse seines used in the Norwegian mackerel and herring fisheries as a function of proportion seine hauled and seine size. Purse seine geometry was monitored with multibeam sonar at sea and a log-linear mixed effects model was applied to the estimated seine volumes. The results indicate a 33-fold decrease in contained volume from 10 to 80% seine hauled and a threefold difference in volume between the largest and smallest measured seines. Fish densities in the seine were predicted to vary greatly depending on seine and catch size and under some conditions exceed safe crowding levels before the catch release limit is reached. This study questions the rationale of having the same catch release limit for all seine and catch sizes.;"[Tenningen, Maria; Handegard, Nils Olav; de Jong, Karen] Inst Marine Res, POB 1870, N-5817 Bergen, Norway; [Pobitzer, Armin] Sintef Alesund, Sintef POB 5760, N-7465 Trondheim, Norway";;Tenningen, M (corresponding author), Inst Marine Res, POB 1870, N-5817 Bergen, Norway.;maria.tenningen@hi.no;"de Jong, Karen/D-1808-2010; Handegard, Nils Olav/I-3047-2012";"de Jong, Karen/0000-0001-9239-7268; Handegard, Nils Olav/0000-0002-9708-9042; Pobitzer, Armin/0000-0003-2344-5232";Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway [243885];We also thank The Research Council of Norway for funding this study through project no. 243885 and Neil Anders for spelling and grammar check.;32;3;4;0;6;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;1054-3139;1095-9289;ICES J MAR SCI;ICES J.

We analysed a dataset of 18062 hauls from 10 to 800 m depth performed annually during the last two decades across 17 Geographical Sub-Areas (GSAs) (MEDITS program). A multi-table analysis (STATICO-CoA) evidenced a strong inter-GSAs stability in the organization of assemblages, with specificities for some GSAs. The most stable structuring factors were linked to combined gradients of chlorophyll a, phytoplancton carbon biomass and temperature, inversely correlated with depth, salinity and nutrient gradients (axis 1 of the STATICO-CoA compromise, 93.74% of the total variability). A common pattern linking the distribution of species to these environmental gradients was evidenced for most of the 17 GSAs.

Incentives for fishers to change their behaviours depend on their economic performances as well as their ability to avoid bycatch. Changes in economic performances under the LO are evaluated based on cost and revenue equations. The nested grid method is then used to explore the spatial and temporal distribution of landings and discards, and to suggest alternative effort allocation to avoid bycatch. This article is focussed specifically on the French otter trawl fishery in the eastern English Channel and southern North Sea. Results suggest that under the LO the choke species problem will curtail fishing activities earlier in the year, leading to significant economic losses. In the absence of significant quota top-ups (at least 75%), a change in fishing practices consisting in reducing overall bycatch by 30% is insufficient to reduce losses. With a particular attention to choke species, more economically efficient avoidance strategies can be found thanks to the nested grid method.;"[Pointin, Fabien; Rochet, Marie-Joelle] Ifremer, EMH, Rue Ile Yeu,BP 21105, F-44311 Nantes 03, France; [Pointin, Fabien] SINAY Co, Consulting Off, 117 Cours Caffarelli, F-14000 Caen, France; [Daures, Fabienne] Univ Brest, Ifremer, CNRS, UMR 6308,AMURE,Unite Econ Maritime,IUEM, F-29280 Plouzane, France";;"Pointin, F (corresponding author), Ifremer, EMH, Rue Ile Yeu,BP 21105, F-44311 Nantes 03, France.; Pointin, F (corresponding author), SINAY Co, Consulting Off, 117 Cours Caffarelli, F-14000 Caen, France.";pointin.fabien@gmail.com;;;"French Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie; Sinay Company; European UnionEuropean Commission [633680]; French National Research Agency (ANR) as part of the Investissements d'Avenir programFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-10-EQPX-17]";This work is part of a PhD funded by the French Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie and Sinay Company.

Our analysis shows that in the northern areas cod catch per unit effort (CPUE, kg h(-1)) was high in the early 1980s whereas it dropped and remained very low thereafter. Conversely, in the southernmost area CPUE largely oscillated after the early 1990s. Our model was able to capture key ecological features of the Baltic cod such as preferred depth of occurrence and response to hypoxic conditions. The model also revealed a clear daily cycle of CPUEs, indicating diel vertical migrations at the population level. The temporal trends of pelagic CPUEs generally followed those from the bottom trawl surveys, although differences were observed especially in the recent years with a relative decline in the cod occurring in the pelagic waters. Our results point to the great potential of acoustic survey trawl catches to complement bottom trawl surveys for investigating the spatio-temporal population dynamics and behaviour of the Baltic cod.;"[Casini, Michele; Tian, Huidong; Orio, Alessandro; Larson, Niklas] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Inst Marine Res, Dept Aquat Resources, Lysekil, Sweden; [Hansson, Martin] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Grygiel, Wlodzimierz] Natl Marine Fisheries Res Inst, Dept Fisheries Resources, Gdynia, Poland; [Strods, Guntars] Inst Food Safety Anim Hlth & Environm, Dept Fish Resources Res, Riga, Latvia; [Statkus, Romas] Minist Agr, Fisheries Serv, Klaipeda, Lithuania; [Sepp, Elor] Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Tallinn, Estonia; [Groehsler, Tomas] Thunen Inst Balt Sea Fisheries, Rostock, Germany";;Casini, M (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Inst Marine Res, Dept Aquat Resources, Lysekil, Sweden.;michele.casini@slu.se;Orio, Alessandro/O-4136-2019;"Orio, Alessandro/0000-0002-5566-6139; Grygiel, Wlodzimierz/0000-0002-4897-5216; Casini, Michele/0000-0003-4910-5236";"PLAN FISH project - Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management; BONUS INSPIRE project - joint Baltic Sea research and development programme BONUS (Art 185); EUEuropean Commission; Swedish Research Council FormasSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas";This study has been partially financed by the PLAN FISH project funded by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency and the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management.

This study focuses more on functional characteristics by addressing the biogeochemical consequences associated with tickler chain beam trawl and electric PulseWing trawl gears. In June 2017, professional fishermen trawled experimental transects with both types of gears in the Frisian Front area of the North Sea. Box core sediment samples and in situ landers were used to evaluate biogeochemical fluxes and sediment characteristics in untrawled and trawled areas (samples taken 3.5-70 h after fishing). A reduction of sedimentary chlorophyll a was observed, which was larger following tickler chain (83%) compared to PulseWing trawling (43%). This displacement of surface material caused significant decreases in the sediment oxygen consumption in tickler chain (41%) and PulseWing trawled samples (33%) along with a deeper penetration of oxygen in the sediment (tickler chain: 3.78 mm, PulseWing: 3.17 mm) compared to untrawled areas (2.27 mm). Our research implies that bottom trawl disturbance can lead to immediate declines in benthic community metabolism, with tickler chain trawling exhibiting more prominent alterations than PulseWing trawling on benthic biogeochemical processes.;"[Tiano, Justin C.; Witbaard, Rob; van Rijswijk, Pieter; Tramper, Anton; van Oevelen, Dick; Soetaert, Karline] Univ Utrecht, Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res NIOZ, Dept Estuarine & Delta Syst, POB 140,Korringaweg 7, NL-4401 NT Yerseke, Netherlands; [Tiano, Justin C.; Soetaert, Karline] Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Marine Biol Sect, Krijgslaan 281-S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Bergman, Magda J.

However, the design of the new quality-improving cod end raised concerns about its size selectivity and the possibility that higher retention probability could negatively impact the catch pattern by increasing the proportion of undersized cod. Therefore, the goal of this study was to quantify and compare the size selectivity and catch pattern for cod when deploying, respectively, the conventional and new quality-improving cod end in the Barents Sea bottom trawl fishery. The new quality-improving cod end had significantly lower relative size selectivity than the conventional cod end, but no significant difference in the catch patterns was detected in the trawl. Further, estimation of the total size selectivity in the trawl revealed that the increased retention of small cod when using the quality-improving cod end was minor. Hence, despite the reduced selectivity, the quality-improving cod end can be used with low risk of retaining small cod.;"[Brinkhof, Jesse; Herrmann, Bent; Larsen, Roger B.] Univ Tromso, Norwegian Coll Fishery & Aquat Sci, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Herrmann, Bent] SINTEF Ocean, Fishing Gear Technol, Willemoesvej 2, DK-9850 Hirtshals, Denmark; [Veiga-Malta, Tiago] Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Aqua, Hirtshals, Denmark";;Brinkhof, J (corresponding author), Univ Tromso, Norwegian Coll Fishery & Aquat Sci, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.;jesse.brinkhof@uit.no;"Larsen, Roger B./AAY-4314-2021; Malta, Tiago/AAL-6718-2021";"Malta, Tiago/0000-0001-8880-3243; Herrmann, Bent/0000-0003-1325-6198";Norwegian Research CouncilResearch Council of NorwayEuropean Commission [203477];This study is part of the project CRISP (Centre of Research-based Innovation in Sustainable Fish Capture and Processing Technology), which is funded by the Norwegian Research Council (Grant No. 203477).

However, small fish can pass through the grid to enter the codend and risk being retained. The risk of retention for fish of different sizes depends the size selection in the Nordmore grid and the size selection in the subsequent codend, which makes the process complex and often results in a bell-shaped size selection curve. In the Barents Sea shrimp fishery, cod (Gadus morhua) is one of the species of concern because of its great commercial value. We studied the size selection of juvenile cod when the trawl was equipped with the compulsory gear in the fishery: a 19 mm Nordmore grid followed by a 35 mm diamond mesh codend. As expected, the size selection curve showed a bell-shaped signature, with a certain size range of juveniles having high retention risk, while the risk for smaller and bigger cod was smaller. The retention risk was highest for cod between 12 and 20 cm in length. We also tested two alternative designs in the aft section of the gear: a codend with 35 mm square mesh panels and a square mesh sorting cone section.

Therefore, management actions to achieve a more sustainable exploitation of fishery resources are required and compelling. In this study, a spatially explicit multi-species bio-economic modeling approach, namely, SMART, was applied to the case study of central Mediterranean Sea to assess the potential effects of different trawl fisheries management scenarios on the demersal resources. The approach combines multiple modeling components, integrating the best available sets of spatial data about catches and stocks, fishing footprint from vessel monitoring systems (VMS) and economic parameters in order to describe the relationships between fishing effort pattern and impacts on resources and socio-economic consequences. Moreover, SMART takes into account the bi-directional connectivity between spawning and nurseries areas of target species, embedding the outcomes of a larvae transport Lagrangian model and of an empirical model of fish migration. Finally, population dynamics and trophic relationships are considered using a MICE (Models of Intermediate Complexity) approach. SMART simulates the fishing effort reallocation resulting from the introduction of different management scenarios. Specifically, SMART was applied to evaluate the potential benefits of different management approaches of the trawl fisheries targeting demersal stocks (deepwater rose shrimp Parapenaeus longirostris, the giant red shrimp Aristaeomorpha foliacea, the European hake Merluccius merluccius, and the red mullet Mullus barbatus) in the Strait of Sicily. The simulated management scenarios included a reduction of both fishing capacity and effort, two different sets of temporal fishing closures, and two sets of spatial fishing closures, defined involving fishers. Results showed that both temporal and spatial closures are expected to determine a significant improvement in the exploitation pattern for all the species, ultimately leading to the substantial recovery of spawning stock biomass for the stocks. Overall, one of the management scenarios suggested by fishers scored better and confirms the usefulness of participatory approaches, suggesting the need for more public consultation when dealing with resource management at sea.;"[Russo, Tommaso; D'Andrea, Lorenzo; Franceschini, Simone; Cataudella, Stefano] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Biol, Lab Expt Ecol & Aquaculture, Rome, Italy; [Accadia, Paolo; Sabatella, Rosaria Felicita] NISEA Soc Cooperat, Salerno, Italy; [Cucco, Andrea; Quattrocchi, Giovanni; Sinerchia, Matteo] CNR, Inst Study Anthrop Impact & Sustainabil Marine En, Oristano, Italy; [Garofalo, Germana; Fiorentino, Fabio] Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Marine Biol Resources & Biotechnol IRBIM, Mazara Del Vallo, Italy; [Gristine, Michele] Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Study Anthrop Impacts & Sustainabil Marine I, Castellammare Del Golfo, Italy; [Parisi, Antonio] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Finance, Rome, Italy; [Canu, Donate M.] Natl Inst Oceanog & Appl Geophys, Trieste, Italy";;Russo, T (corresponding author), Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Biol, Lab Expt Ecol & Aquaculture, Rome, Italy.;tommaso.russo@uniroma2.it;"Quattrocchi, Giovanni/Q-3970-2018; cucco, andrea/B-4553-2012; Fiorentino, Fabio/AAX-2883-2020; Melaku Canu, Donata/O-9290-2015; Russo, Tommaso/C-6157-2014";"Quattrocchi, Giovanni/0000-0002-0020-1780; cucco, andrea/0000-0002-4469-2286; Melaku Canu, Donata/0000-0002-1853-2115; Russo, Tommaso/0000-0003-4047-959X; D'Andrea, Lorenzo/0000-0002-3795-3601";European Commission - Directorate General MARE (Maritime Affairs and Fisheries) through the Research Project MANTIS: Marine protected Areas Network Towards Sustainable fisheries in the Central Mediterranean [Ares (2015)5672134-08/12/2015, MARE/2014/41];This work has been supported by the European Commission - Directorate General MARE (Maritime Affairs and Fisheries) through the Research Project MANTIS: Marine protected Areas Network Towards Sustainable fisheries in the Central Mediterranean [MARE/2014/41-Ref.

However, small fish can still pass through the grid to enter the codend, which increases their risk of being retained. In this study, we quantified the selectivity of a standard Nordmore grid used together with one of two different codend designs, namely a diamond mesh codend with square mesh panels and a codend with a square mesh sorting cone section, for deep-water shrimp (Pandalus borealis), redfish (Sebastes spp.), and American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides). For the first time, the selective properties of these two alternative designs were estimated and compared to those of a Nordmore grid used together with a 35-mm diamond mesh codend, which is the compulsory gear used in the fishery today. With this traditional codend, the size selectivity of both bycatch species showed the expected characteristic bell-shaped size selection pattern, with low retention probability of very small fish and bigger fish but with high retention probability of certain sizes of juveniles. Using the square mesh sorting cone significantly reduced the maximum retention risk of redfish. The maximum retention with the diamond mesh codend with square mesh panels was estimated to be 14% lower than that of the traditional codend, but the difference was not statistically significant. The two alternative codend designs did not result in any significant reduction in bycatch of American plaice.;"[Sistiaga, Manu; Herrmann, Bent; Brinkhof, Jesse] SINTEF Ocean, Trondheim, Norway; [Sistiaga, Manu] Inst Marine Res, Bergen, Norway; [Herrmann, Bent; Larsen, Roger Bertrand; Brinkhof, Jesse] Arctic Univ Norway, UiT, Tromso, Norway";;"Sistiaga, M (corresponding author), SINTEF Ocean, Trondheim, Norway.; Sistiaga, M (corresponding author), Inst Marine Res, Bergen, Norway.";manu.sistiaga@hi.no;Larsen, Roger B./AAY-4314-2021;"Larsen, Roger B./0000-0003-2884-5817; Herrmann, Bent/0000-0003-1325-6198";"Arctic University of Norway (UIT) in Tromso; Norwegian Seafood Research Fund [901303]; Directorate of Fisheries of Norway";This work was supported by the Arctic University of Norway (UIT) in Tromso, the Norwegian Seafood Research Fund (Grant number 901303), and the Directorate of Fisheries of Norway.

The analysis revealed that from 75 non-target species, fish constituted about 69.4% of the total catch weight, whereas invertebrates reached about 30.6%. For non-target fish, 51 fishes were identified (50 bony fishes and one elasmobranch), of which 17 lessepsian species were found. The high percentage of fish (82.67%) was with an average length between 4.0 and <9.0 cm. The highly represented fish species by numbers were: Engraulis encrasicolus (25.608%), Herklotsichthys punctatus (23.711%), Terapon puta (9.572%), Equulites klunzingeri (9.342%), Gobius niger (7.177%), Argyrosomus regius (6.280%), Alepes djedaba (4.155%), Gobius paganellus (3.397%), Sardinella aurita (2.525%), Ariosoma balearicum (1.093%) and Diplodus annularis (0.803%). Total analysis, seasonal analysis and an index of diversity (H') for the non-target catch species were provided. On the other hand, length-weight relationship, condition factor and age composition were described for the most dominant species. For non-target invertebrates, 24 species were identified among which 13 lessepsian species were found. Shrimps and mantis shrimp Erugosquilla massavensis were the main constituents during the period of study. The authors propose to change the cod end mesh size from 2.5 cm to 4.0 cm to minimize the high percentage of non-target catch and preserve recruits of valuable species from over fishing along the Egyptian coast of the Mediterranean Sea while doing experiments to ensure the best results. Further, continuous monitoring and managements of trawlers must be put into consideration.

The effect of trawling was investigated throughout a 5-year period in terms of horizontal/vertical fluxes and changes in seabed mud content, and compared to the natural variability of sediment fluxes at different spatio-temporal scales. Trawling is shown in the model to significantly contribute to sediment re-suspension, and changes in the seabed at the scale of the shelf. The contribution of trawling to re-suspension is > 80% during the high fishing season at many locations on the outer shelf and over the Grande-Vasiere area (a large and intensively trawled muddy zone located in the middle of the shelf). The contribution of trawling is significantly weaker in winter and at annual scale, particularly over zones with (muddy-) sand facies (between 1 parts per thousand and 1%), but remains high, and reaches 20% of the annual erosion over muddy areas (e.g. northern part of the Grande-Vasiere). This significant trawling-induced erosion dynamics results in high sediment fluxes which increase natural poleward dynamics from a few percent up to 40%, and contributes to the natural offshore export of sediment on the outer shelf (e.g. + 35% of mud fluxes along the 130 m isobath). It is noteworthy that trawling-induced fluxes are larger in winter although the corresponding re suspension is lower than in summer: this is due to stronger near-bottom flows occurring at this period (largely influenced by energetic wind conditions). In contrast, on the inner shelf, trawling-induced sediment fluxes are rather oriented towards the coast. Finally, simulation results reveal a trawling signature on changes in the seabed. A significant decrease (between 10% and > 50%) in mud content is simulated over trawling hotspots, especially over the internal part of the Grande-Vasiere and on mud patches located in front of the Gironde estuary. Conversely, trawling causes or intensifies mud deposition on both sides of these preferentially trawled areas.;"[Mengual, Baptiste; Le Hir, Pierre; Cayocca, Florence] IFREMER DYNECO DHYSED, Ctr Bretagne, ZI Pointe Diable, CS 10070, F-29280 Plouzane, France; [Cayocca, Florence] AAMP, 16 Quai Douane, F-29200 Brest, France; [Garlan, Thierry] SHOM DOPS HOM Sedimentol, 13 Rue Chatellier,CS 92803, F-29228 Brest 02, France";;Mengual, B (corresponding author), IFREMER DYNECO DHYSED, Ctr Bretagne, ZI Pointe Diable, CS 10070, F-29280 Plouzane, France.;bapt.mengual@hotmail.fr;;;"SHOM (French Navy hydrographic and oceanographic service); IFREMER (French research institute for exploitation of the sea)";This study was supported by the SHOM (French Navy hydrographic and oceanographic service) and the IFREMER (French research institute for exploitation of the sea).

Therefore, fishers use stackable conical pots that allow large numbers of pots to be carried on deck for each trip. One of the drawbacks of using stackable pots is that the entrance is at the vertex of the conical pot, which fishers claim does not provide the desired fishing efficiency. Thus, the goal of this study was to determine whether a different pot design would improve the catch efficiency of snow crabs. We investigated the efficiency of a new type of pot called the moon pot, which provides continuous increased bait odour intensity as snow crabs make their way towards the entrance of the pot. This alteration was expected to increase catch efficiency compared to that of the conical pots used by the fleet today. However, experimental fishing results showed that the modified pots had significantly lower catch efficiency than the standard conical pots, as only similar to 66% of the number of crabs caught by the conical pots were caught in the moon pots. The main reason for this reduced catch efficiency likely was the initial steepness of the moon pot, which may have made it difficult for crabs to reach the pot entrance. These results demonstrated that pot design can dramatically affect catch efficiency of snow crabs.;"[Olsen, Leonore; Herrmann, Bent] SINTEF Nord, Tromso, Norway; [Herrmann, Bent; Grimaldo, Eduardo; Sistiaga, Manu] SINTEF Ocean, Trondheim, Norway";;Grimaldo, E (corresponding author), SINTEF Ocean, Trondheim, Norway.;Eduardo.Grimaldo@sintef.no;;Herrmann, Bent/0000-0003-1325-6198;"Opilio AS; Egersund Trawl AS; Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway [269251/O80]; Directorate of Fisheries in Norway [17/17063]; SINTEF NordSINTEF; SINTEF OceanSINTEF";This study was part of the project CRABPOT, which is funded Opilio AS, Egersund Trawl AS, the Research Council of Norway (grant no. 269251/O80), the Directorate of Fisheries in Norway (grant no. 17/17063).

The northern central Adriatic Sea is one of the most overfished basins of the Mediterranean Sea and it supports a very valuable marine biodiversity, including sea turtles. This study assesses the spatial and seasonal impact of the northern central Adriatic midwater pair trawl fishery on loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) by examining incidental catches recorded between 2006 and 2018 and environmental variables. The model predicted seasonal variation of loggerhead distribution. According to previous studies, data analysis indicates that most bycatch events of loggerhead turtle occurred in the northern Adriatic Sea. The present data confirm that the northern Adriatic may be an important foraging area for loggerhead turtle. They also highlight the urgent need for a better understanding of the interactions between sea turtles and fisheries to develop and apply suitable, ad hoc management measures in critical habitats.;"[Pulcinella, Jacopo; Bonanomi, Sara; Colombelli, Alessandro; Moro, Fabrizio; Lucchetti, Alessandro; Sala, Antonello] Italian Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Biol Resources & Marine Biotechnol IRBIM, Ancona, Italy; [Fortuna, Caterina Maria] Italian Natl Inst Environm Protect & Res ISPRA, Rome, Italy";;Pulcinella, J (corresponding author), Italian Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Biol Resources & Marine Biotechnol IRBIM, Ancona, Italy.;jacopo.pulcinella@irbim.cnr.it;"Fortuna, Caterina Maria/J-7796-2016; Bonanomi, Sara/Q-4026-2018; Sala, Antonello/B-8517-2016; Lucchetti, Alessandro/AAV-7188-2020";"Fortuna, Caterina Maria/0000-0003-3036-5337; Bonanomi, Sara/0000-0002-2236-9015; Sala, Antonello/0000-0001-7066-1152; Lucchetti, Alessandro/0000-0001-8418-9848; Colombelli, Alessandro/0000-0003-3855-161X; Pulcinella, Jacopo/0000-0003-4142-5067";Italian Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry;This research was supported by the Italian Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.;69;4;4;4;12;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND;;2296-7745;FRONT MAR SCI;Front.

We tested whether changing the 2-panel knotted codend used by the Norwegian trawler fleet operating in the Barents Sea today to a 2-panel knotless codend or a 4-panel knotless codend could decrease the extent of external damage to the fish in the catch. We evaluated 720 fish over 12 hauls carried out with a twin trawl setup and found that the probability for cod to be without any external damage was 9.4% (4.7%-15.8%) with the codend used in the fishery today. Thus, most fish in these catches are likely to have slight or moderate damage. Gear marks were the most frequent type of damage, with only 11.5% (6.0%-18.9%) of the cod being free of this type of injury. When gear marks were not considered in the analysis, 68.4% (58.8%-78.3%) of the fish was estimated to be flawless. Replacing the knotted netting in the codend increased the probability of obtaining fish without gear marks to 15.5% (6.2%-28.0%). However, the confidence intervals were wide, and this effect was not statistically significant. For the other three damage types, the estimated effects of changing the design of the codend were small and not statistically significant. Changing from a 2- to 4-panel codend was estimated to reduce the probability for gear marks by a further 1.7% (- 13.4%-16.8%). However, this increase was not significant. Overall, the two codend design changes tested in this study did not significantly decrease the external damage present on trawl-caught cod.;"[Tveit, Guro Moen; Sistiaga, Manu] SINTEF Ocean, Seafood Technol, Brattorkaia 17C, N-7010 Trondheim, Norway; [Herrmann, Bent] SINTEF Ocean, Seafood Technol, Willemoesvej 2, DK-9850 Hirtshals, Denmark; [Brinkhof, Jesse] Arctic Univ Norway UIT, Hansine Hansens Veg 18, N-9019 Tromso, Norway";;Tveit, GM (corresponding author), SINTEF Ocean, Seafood Technol, Brattorkaia 17C, N-7010 Trondheim, Norway.;Guro.Tveit@sintef.no;;"Tveit, Guro/0000-0001-8272-2725; Herrmann, Bent/0000-0003-1325-6198";"Norwegian Seafood Research Fund (FHF) [901232]; Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries; Research Council of Norway (NRC)Research Council of Norway [268388/E40]";We would like to thank Havfisk AS and the Crew of F/Tr Havtind for their help during the fishing trials.

Image processing techniques have been widely applied in acoustic remote sensing, but accurate trawl-mark (TM) detection is underdeveloped. The paper presents a new algorithm for the automatic detection and spatial quantification of TMs that is implemented on sidescan sonar (SSS) images of a fishing ground from the Gulf of Patras in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. This method inspects any structure of the local seafloor in an environmentally adaptive procedure, in order to overcome the predicament of analyzing noisy and complex SSS images of the seafloor. The initial preprocessing stage deals with radiometric inconsistencies. Then, multiplex filters in the spatial domain are performed with multiscale rotated Haar-like features through integral images that locate the TM-like forms and additionally discriminate the textural characteristics of the seafloor. The final TMs are selected according to their geometric and background environment features, and the algorithm successfully produces a set of trawling-ground quantification values that could be established as a baseline measure for the status assessment of a fishing ground.;"[Gournia, Charikleia; Fakiris, Elias; Geraga, Maria; Papatheodorou, George] Univ Patras, Dept Geol, Lab Marine Geol & Phys Oceanog, Rion 26500, Greece; [Williams, David P.] NATO Sci & Technol Org, Ctr Maritime Res & Expt, I-19126 La Spezia, Italy";;Gournia, C (corresponding author), Univ Patras, Dept Geol, Lab Marine Geol & Phys Oceanog, Rion 26500, Greece.;"math07041@upnet.gr; fakiris@upatras.gr; mgeraga@upatras.gr; williams@cmre.nato.int; gpapathe@upatras.gr";", Fakiris/AAB-3801-2020; Gournia, Charikleia/AAE-4654-2019";", Fakiris/0000-0002-3290-5467; Gournia, Charikleia/0000-0003-3409-2161";;;91;4;4;0;1;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2076-3263;GEOSCIENCES;Geosciences;MAY;2019;9;5;;;;;;214;10.3390/geosciences9050214;;;23;Geosciences, Multidisciplinary;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Geology;IC4VV;WOS:000470966100023;;gold, Green Submitted;;;10/01/2022

Data from 101 dredging operations were analysed for contrasting spatial and seasonal variability of damage, with the use of a three-level damage scale. 4.5% of discarded individuals displayed intermediate damage, whereas 11.3% displayed severe damage. Echinoderms displayed the highest level of damage (similar to 75% of total collected individuals) and Echinocardium cf. mediterraneum was the most susceptible discarded species (85% with severe damage), followed by bivalves (7.3%) and crustaceans (3.3%). The target Chamelea gallina showed a low proportion of damaged individuals, probably due to their thick protective shell, which promotes the survival of discarded undersized target individuals. Spatial differences in damage level on discards were linked to some gear characteristics, to the higher amount of gravels and to longer tow durations, whereas damage was generally higher in cold months and partly related to higher quantities of hard shelled molluscs, in both cases increasing the abrasion and damage to retained organisms. Data suggest that dredges with a lower number of narrower iron teeth and towed for a shorter time could decrease the damage rate in discards of this fishery. A spatial management plan based on the type of grounds would be useful in order to improve efficiency of these fisheries and minimize their impact to soft bottoms with different commercial catches and biological communities.;"[Urra, Javier; Garcia, Teresa; Lozano, Matias; Rueda, Jose L.; Baro, Jorge] Inst Espanol Oceanog, Ctr Oceanog Malaga, Puerto Pesquero S-N, Fuengirola 29640, Spain; [Leon, Estefania; Gallardo-Roldan, Helena] Univ Cadiz, Ctr Andaluz Super Estudios Marinos, Cadiz 11510, Spain";;Urra, J (corresponding author), Inst Espanol Oceanog, Ctr Oceanog Malaga, Puerto Pesquero S-N, Fuengirola 29640, Spain.;javier.urra.recuero@gmail.com;Rueda, Jose L./F-4868-2016;"Rueda, Jose L./0000-0003-4632-1523; Urra, Javier/0000-0002-0255-7246";"Junta de Andalucia (Spain)Junta de Andalucia [126/2012-SEN]; Instituto Espanol de Oceanografia (IEO) [126/2012-SEN]; European Fisheries Fund";This study was developed under the collaboration agreement between Junta de Andalucia (Spain) and Instituto Espanol de Oceanografia (IEO) (Contract 126/2012-SEN), within the framework of the research project entitled 'Estudio integral en zonas de proteccion pesquera y marisquera y otras areas marinas protegidas del litoral andaluz: Estudio previo para la proteccion, ordenacion y determinacion de reservas marisqueras en el litoral mediterraneo de Andalucia' (REMAN-REMARAN).

This issue has been evidenced from historical ecological studies and from the evaluation of the effects of effective and large marine protected areas. In two fishery reserves off the northern Sicily coast the red mullet Mullus barbatus underwent an impressive biomass increment and a few piscivores fish species recovered after a trawl ban. The red mullet, more than 20% of all demersal fish in the untrawled areas, represented a huge food resource to its potential predators. By contrasting two trawled and two untrawled gulfs we figured out predator - prey relationships through the use of a combined approach based on trophic niche, stable isotopes data and biomass. We show that the white grouper Epinephelus aeneus and the black-bellied anglerfish Lophius budegassa are the most important predators of the red mullet with higher biomass in the untrawled areas. We also found a potential re-establishment of the trophic role for white grouper inside the untrawled areas.

Moreover, the fisheries yield is quantified and analyzed in terms of landings with respect to official management area of registration of vessels. In this way, the real area of activity of each fleet is not considered and this prevent an effective spatial analysis of the factors affecting fisheries yield and stocks status. This paper firstly presents a VMS-based reconstruction of the fishing effort and of the area of activity of the Italian trawlers in the Mediterranean Sea. The fishing area of each fleet is then used as a spatial reference to estimate primary productivity rate and gross primary production and to investigate, by using General Additive Models, the effects of trawling effort, primary production and time on fisheries yield, fisheries productivity and overexploitation rate for some key demersal species. The results evidence that the usage of satellite-based information of fishing activities and of primary production, when combined at the real spatial scale of fishing activities, could effectively improve our ability to analyze the response of the ecosystems to these driving forces and allow capturing the main trends of yield, productivity and overexploitation rate of demersal stocks.;"[Russo, Tommaso; D'Andrea, Lorenzo; De Angelis, Paola; Franceschini, Simone; Scardi, Michele; Cataudella, Stefano] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Biol, Lab Expt Ecol & Aquaculture, Rome, Italy; [Carpentieri, Paolo] Maja Societe Cooperat Arl, Rome, Italy; [Fiorentino, Fabio; Garofalo, Germana] Ist Risorse Biol & Biotecnol Marine IRBIM, Mazara Del Vallo, Italy; [Labanchi, Lucio] Societa Cooperat MABLY, Salemo, Italy; [Parisi, Antonio] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Finance, Rome, Italy";;Russo, T (corresponding author), Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Biol, Lab Expt Ecol & Aquaculture, Rome, Italy.;Tommaso.Russo@Uniroma2.it;"Fiorentino, Fabio/AAX-2883-2020; De Angelis, Paola/AAH-9938-2019; Russo, Tommaso/C-6157-2014";"Russo, Tommaso/0000-0003-4047-959X; D'Andrea, Lorenzo/0000-0002-3795-3601";Italian Ministry of Agricultural, Alimentary and Forestry Politics;This work has been supported by the Italian Ministry of Agricultural, Alimentary and Forestry Politics with the Research Project Basi scientifiche e strumenti a supporto dei Piani di Gestione della pesca nell'ambito della Politica Comune della Pesca e delle politiche ambientali ed economiche.;41;19;20;0;0;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND;;2296-7745;FRONT MAR SCI;Front.

The experiments were carried out in the Iskenderun Bay, located in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, between 15 January and 15 March 2012, when the amount of trawl catch was the lowest in the fishing season. The experiments were conducted on board Ali Kaptan-6 (22 m, 500 hp main engine) by employing a conventional bottom trawl commercially used in Iskenderun Bay. The hooped covered codend method was used to obtain selectivity data. Eight valid hauls were carried out both with codend and protective bag. The data were collected for brushtooth lizardfish (Saurida undosquamis) and Randall's threadfin bream (Nemiplerus randalli) which were Red Sea migrants and dominated fish for trawl catch in the area. Selectivity parameters were obtained by using logistic equation with the maximum likelihood method. As a result, protective bag had negative effects for especially the brushtooth lizardfish on codend selectivity, although the species were very successful in escaping trawl codend mesh openings due to is fusiform body.;"[Demirci, Sevil; Demirci, Aydin; Simsek, Emrah] Iskenderun Tech Univ, Fac Marine Sci & Technol, Dept Marine Technol, TR-31200 Iskenderun, Hatay, Turkey";;Demirci, A (corresponding author), Iskenderun Tech Univ, Fac Marine Sci & Technol, Dept Marine Technol, TR-31200 Iskenderun, Hatay, Turkey.;aydin.demirci@iste.edu.tr;"DEMIRCI, Aydin/AAB-2581-2021; Simsek, Emrah/AAB-9626-2020";Simsek, Emrah/0000-0001-7066-2534;;;21;0;0;0;0;NATL INST SCIENCE COMMUNICATION-NISCAIR;NEW DELHI;DR K S KRISHNAN MARG, PUSA CAMPUS, NEW DELHI 110 012, INDIA;0379-5136;0975-1033;INDIAN J GEO-MAR SCI;Indian J.

For some species this mortality may be sufficient to cause population declines. The Baltic Sea is a global 'hotspot' for bird bycatch in gillnet fisheries and is globally important for wintering sea ducks, but no technical solution has been found yet to reduce bird bycatch in gillnet fisheries in the Baltic. Here, we report on trials conducted in the Baltic Sea to test whether two different gillnet modifications with visual stimuli can effectively reduce bird bycatch while maintaining volume of fish caught. We conducted paired trials of two types of visual stimuli attached to nets: 1) high contrast monochrome net panels and 2) net lights (constant green and flashing white LED lights). We measured the amount of fish and birds caught in standard nets and those modified with the visual stimuli. Neither of the two most commonly caught species, Long- tailed Ducks (Clangula hyemalis) and Velvet Scoters (Melanitta fusca), were deterred from lethal encounters with nets by either black-and-white panels or by steady green or flashing white net lights. Long-tailed Ducks were caught in larger numbers in nets equipped with flashing white net lights than in unmodified nets at the same location. Catch rates of commercial fish were not affected by net lights or net panels placed within the nets. Hence, while the deterrents that we tested successfully maintained fish catch, they failed to reduce bird bycatch and are therefore ineffective. We discuss likely avenues for future investigation of bycatch mitigation methods for gillnet fisheries, including species and location response to net lights, managed fishery closures, above-water distraction of birds and gear switching.

Moreover, it is difficult to find discriminant markers. The eastern part of the Bay of Seine (English Channel) is highly impacted by the presence of harbour activities, fishing and sediment extraction. Dredged sediment from the Grand Port Maritime du Havre (GPMH) are deposited at the subtidal Octeville site, in the north-eastern part of the mouth of the Seine estuary (mixed sediment area). To understand natural and anthropogenic sedimentary mechanisms in this area, a geochemical and sedimentological study was conducted at the beginning of 2016. A dense sampling campaign including 179 stations was carried out between Cap de La Heve and Cap d'Antifer. For comparison, sampling was carried out in the harbour (13 samples in basins strongly or very weakly dredged), in the dredged grab itself and in the Seine estuary sediment (one station in the brackish zone and two stations in the river freshwater zone). Elemental compositions were determined by X-Ray Fluorescence spectrometry and infrared spectrometry. Using PCA (Principal Component Analysis), seven constituents were selected (Si, As, S, Pb, Rb, organic Br and TOC) to determine the area influenced by dumped spoil and the sediment transport directions. Sediment areas in dynamic equilibrium display a TOC gradient perpendicular to the coastline, linked to granulometric variations due to a combination of the swell and tidal currents. In the study area, dredged sediment are finer grained and have undergone changes due to the influence of diagenetic processes characteristic of the harbour environment. As a result, these sediment are enriched in sulphides, Pb, TOC and Rb, which allows us to highlight the in-situ deposited sediment spoil. Dumped sediment and the area subject to their influence are clearly identified since they locally disrupt the natural dynamic equilibrium state.;"[Baux, Noemie; Lesourd, Sandric; Dauvin, Jean-Claude] Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, UNFROUEN, CNRS,UMR 6143,M2C, F-14000 Caen, France; [Murat, Anne; Faivre, Quentin; Poizot, Emmanuel; Mear, Yann] Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, Lab Sci Appl Cherbourg, EA 4253, F-50100 Cherbourg, France; [Murat, Anne; Faivre, Quentin; Poizot, Emmanuel; Mear, Yann] Conservatoire Natl Arts & Metiers, INTECHMER, F-50100 Cherbourg, France; [Brasselet, Sebastien] GPMH, F-76067 Le Havre, France";;Baux, N (corresponding author), Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, UNFROUEN, CNRS,UMR 6143,M2C, F-14000 Caen, France.;noemie.baux@unicaen.fr;;FAIVRE, Quentin/0000-0002-9985-5118;Grand Port Maritime du Havre (GPMH, Terre Plein de la Barre, La Havre, FRANCE) [2015/0448];The results in this study come from the Ph.D. thesis of N.

This study explores the effect of mesh size on selectivity of the commercially important narwal shrimp, Plesionika narval, in the Mediterranean Sea. Three different mesh sizes (8 x 8, 12 x 12 and 12 x 25 mm) were tested in fishing trials, with a theoretical Minimum Landing Size (MLS) using a defined maturity size of 12 mm to support interpretation of the results. Using the retention rates and the estimations on population fractions above and below MLS, we show that the use of the smallest- and largest-sized meshes would not support sustainable or efficient fishery. The results demonstrate a significant decrease in capture probability of undersized narwal shrimps with increased mesh size. The medium-sized mesh traps prove to be the best compromise for the fishery with high catch efficiency of commercial size shrimp and a low capture probability of undersized individuals. The results outlined in this article could be used to develop management plans for small-scale trap fisheries as a basis for developing viable enterprises in remote coastal communities.;"[Kalogirou, S.] Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Marine Biol Resources & Inland Waters, Rhodes 85100, Greece; [Kalogirou, S.] Hydrobiol Stn Rhodes, Rhodes 85100, Greece; [Pihl, L.] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, S-566 Kristineberg, Sweden; [Maravelias, C.

A promising innovation implemented to reduce the environmental impact in the brown shrimp (Crangon crangon) fishery is the use of electric pulses to stimulate shrimp. In recent years, several of these so called pulse trawls have been used in the North Sea, but limited catch comparisons have been conducted so far. This study is the first in which a direct catch comparison between a traditional beam trawl and a pulse trawl is executed over an entire fishing season. The results illustrate that pulse stimulation enables a discard reduction of small shrimp of up to 35% and a reduction of benthos and fish discards of up to 76%, with no loss of commercial shrimp. In addition, contact of the groundgear with the seabed is reduced by using a straight bobbin rope with less bobbins. Therefore, on conditions of associated management and regulation, pulse trawling is probably the best available alternative to the existing trawl gear to achieve a shrimp fishery with reduced by-catch rates.;"[Verschueren, Bart; Lenoir, Heleen; Soetaert, Maarten; Polet, Hans] Inst Agr & Fisheries Res ILVO, Anim Sci Fisheries & Aquat Prod, Ankerstr 1, B-8400 Oostende, Belgium";;Lenoir, H (corresponding author), Inst Agr & Fisheries Res ILVO, Anim Sci Fisheries & Aquat Prod, Ankerstr 1, B-8400 Oostende, Belgium.;Heleen.Lenoir@ilvo.vlaanderen.be;;;"Dutch Stichting Verduurzaming Garnalenvisserij; Wadden Fund";Without intense cooperation with the Dutch shrimp fishery sector, present scientific research would never have been achieved.

Depth of the trawl hauls ranged from 30m in the south to 450m in the north. As a result of 311 trawl samples, 200 species belonging to eight taxonomic groups (Porifera, Cnidaria, Annelida, Arthropoda, Mollusca, Echinodermata, Tunicata, Chordata) were identified. The changes in species composition based on depth and region were determined to be statistically significant. It was found that species composition distinctly changed around 200m. In a regional assessment it was determined that the Turkish coast of the Aegean Sea is divided into three sub-regions, i.e. Canakkale, Foca-Karaburun-Sack and Gulluk.

Selectivity data were collected by using a covered codend method and analysed taking between haul variations in to account. The selectivity parameters were estimated by using CC2000 software. Results showed that commercially used 40D trawl codend is not selective enough to release immature of whiting. However, the net change in square mesh (36S and 40S) instead of a diamond-shaped (40D) mesh significantly improved the mesh selectivity for whiting. The 40S trawl codend is even higher than the first maturity size (L-M50) with a length at fifty percent retention (L-50) of 15.74 cm.

The SELECT method was used to determine the selectivity of gill nets. The deviances from the SELECT method revealed that lognormal models gave the best fits for all seasons. As a result of the calculations made according to the lognormal model, the modal lengths of the gill nets were calculated as the shortest in the spring season and the longest in the summer. The spread values of the selectivity curves of the experimental gill nets were determined the lowest in the winter season and the highest in the summer season. As a result of selectivity analysis, the differences between the spring and summer season modal lengths of the nets were calculated as 1.5 cm, 1.65 cm, and 1.82 cm for the nets with 18 mm, 20 mm, and 22 mm mesh sizes, respectively.

Discard survival is known to be highly variable and influenced by numerous factors, including conditions during the catch, on-board the fishing vessels, and post-discard. Therefore, obtaining unambiguous results in discard survival experiments is challenging. We conducted the first systematic year-round discard survival study of flatfish in the Western Baltic Sea on-board a commercial stern trawler under realistic fishing conditions (13 monthly hauls from May 2015 to May 2016) to test whether delayed mortality can be predicted by vitality scores and reflex action mortality predictor (RAMP) scores in combination with variable conditions during catch, processing, and post-release. The factors vessel type, gear, haul duration, fishing ground, depth, handling time, and processing procedures were kept constant as much as possible. On-board, live individual flatfish were tested for vitality and the presence of reflexes for RAMP, then discarded and kept in cages on the bottom of the seafloor for about a week after which the delayed mortality was determined. The proportions of discarded plaice, flounder, and dab that were dead after being kept in the cages ranged from 5% to 100%, 0% to 96%, and 33% to 100%, respectively. Higher mortalities occurred in summer-autumn when air and water temperatures were higher, catches smaller, and catches contained smaller proportions of roundfish. Relationships between RAMP scores and mortality probabilities varied substantially across the monthly trials. Indeed, in addition to RAMP or vitality scores and individual reflexes, the factors air and water temperature and catch weight and catch composition were significant in logistic GLMs explaining delayed mortality.

Traps produce catches of high quality and value, associated with limited bycatch and low habitat impact. Long-standing trap SSFs in both the Mediterranean and the Atlantic showcase the potential of such SSFs to support remote fishing communities; however, trap SSFs remain relatively understudied. Here, we investigate the spatial and temporal dynamics of a Greek trap SSF targeting Plesionika narval (Fabricius, 1787) in the eastern Mediterranean, by means of Generalized Additive Models fitted on fishers' logbook data from 2005 to 2014. The dynamics of both catch per unit effort (CPUE) and profits suggest a pronounced seasonality for this fishery, while there are also signs of local overexploitation in the traditional fishing grounds. Additionally, small vessels (< 12 m) report higher CPUEs than larger vessels. Our results point to management measures that could improve the sustainability of this valuable SSF, such as changes in the spatial and temporal allocation of fishing effort, and in fleet composition. The insights gained from this study are relevant to other localized trap SSFs and illustrate the socioeconomic potential of such fisheries for remote fishing communities.";"[Vasilakopoulos, Paraskevas; Maravelias, Christos D.; Anastasopoulou, Aikaterini; Kapiris, Konstantinos] Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Marine Biol Resources & Inland Waters, 46-7 Km Athens Sounio Ave, Anavyssos 19013, Greece; [Vasilakopoulos, Paraskevas] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Directorate Sustainable Resources D, Unit Water & Marine Resources D 02, Via Enrico Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy; [Smith, Christopher J.] Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Marine Biol Resources & Inland Waters, POB 2214, Iraklion 71003, Crete, Greece; [Kalogirou, Stefanos] Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Marine Biol Resources & Inland Waters, Hydrobiol Stn Rhodes, Rhodes, Greece";;"Vasilakopoulos, P (corresponding author), Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Marine Biol Resources & Inland Waters, 46-7 Km Athens Sounio Ave, Anavyssos 19013, Greece.; Kalogirou, S (corresponding author), Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Marine Biol Resources & Inland Waters, Hydrobiol Stn Rhodes, Rhodes, Greece.";"parvasilak@gmail.com; stefanos.kalogirou@gmail.com";"Kalogirou, Stefanos/G-9133-2011; Maravelias, Christos/W-4151-2019";"Kalogirou, Stefanos/0000-0002-3064-9236; Maravelias, Christos/0000-0002-2440-3707; Smith, Christopher/0000-0002-3031-5316; ANASTASOPOULOU, AIKATERINI/0000-0003-0872-6984";Plesionika Manage project, Operational programme for Fisheries (OPF), 3.5 Pilot projects;This study was funded within the framework of Plesionika Manage project, Operational programme for Fisheries (OPF), 3.5 Pilot projects (www.plesionika-manage.eu).We thank three anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments for the improvement of this manuscript.

Submarine canyons are complex environments that can harbor high biodiversity of benthic ecosystems and high biomass of fish species, thus representing preferential fishing areas for bottom trawling fleets. The effects of bottom trawling on the benthic epifauna were investigated over the soft-bottom margins of the Gioia Canyon (Southeastern Tyrrhenian Sea) by means of quantitative analysis of Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) video transects and compared with the recent pattern of trawling intensity, reconstructed through processing of data collected with the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS). Four ROV transects were then performed at 320-540 m depth in areas affected by different trawling pressure. The analysis was focused on the bamboo coral Isidella elongate and the sea pen Funiculina quadrangularis, which are considered indicator taxa of Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs) and relevant in terms of sustainable management priorities. I. elongata only occurred at the two deeper stations, below 400 m depth. This species showed a clear relationship with trawling intensity, since its abundance was significantly higher under low trawling intensity, where coexistence of large (> 20 cm height) and small colonies was observed. The relatively high prevalence of small colonies in areas exposed to higher trawling effort was interpreted as a consequence of the trawling activity that removed the larger colonies. However, the frequent occurrence of dead colonies and the diffuse presence of epibionts (e.g. the anemone Amphianthus dohrnii and the hydroid Clytia linearis) on living colonies indicate stressful conditions for I. elongata even in areas where trawling intensity was lower. Conversely, the relationship between trawling intensity and species abundance was not straightforward for F. quadrangularis; despite the lowest abundance of this species was recorded in areas subject to high trawling intensity, relatively high abundances were observed in areas with intermediate trawling effort. Although such distribution may be driven by other environmental factors, it suggests that vulnerability to bottom trawling can be different for the two species.";"[Pierdomenico, Martina; Martorelli, Eleonora] Italian Natl Res Council, Inst Environm Geol & Geoengn CNR IGAG, Rome, Italy; [Russo, Tommaso; D'Andrea, Lorenzo] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Lab Expt Ecol & Aquaculture, Rome, Italy; [Ambroso, Stefano; Gori, Andrea; Gili, Josep-Maria] CSIC, ICM, Barcelona, Spain; [Chiocci, Francesco L.] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Earth Sci, Rome, Italy";;Pierdomenico, M (corresponding author), Italian Natl Res Council, Inst Environm Geol & Geoengn CNR IGAG, Rome, Italy.;martina.pierdomenico@uniroma1.it;"Gori, Andrea/AAT-4501-2020; Russo, Tommaso/C-6157-2014";"Gori, Andrea/0000-0001-8442-8079; PIERDOMENICO, MARTINA/0000-0003-1840-2801; Russo, Tommaso/0000-0003-4047-959X; D'Andrea, Lorenzo/0000-0002-3795-3601; CHIOCCI, Francesco Latino/0000-0002-4584-2258; Martorelli, Eleonora/0000-0002-4721-1214";;;82;12;12;2;17;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0079-6611;;PROG OCEANOGR;Prog.

The canyon axis and flanks, as well as the adjacent open slope, were sampled at water depths ranging from 300 m to 2200 m. Grain size, dry bulk density, and Pb-210 concentration profiles were measured to assess possible changes in sedimentation rates over the last century and their temporal and spatial relationship to bottom trawling effort. Sedimentation rates in the upper canyon axis (900-1200 m) had the highest rates of 0.9-2.1 cm.yr(-1), quantified since the 1970s. Farther downcanyon, sedimentation rates increased two to five times after the 1970s, from 0.1-0.2 cmyr(-1) to 0.2-0.8 cm.yr(-1),which coincides with a rapid growth of the total engine power of the fishing fleet operating in the study area. The enhanced sedimentation rates occur downslope of the main fishing grounds and decrease downcanyon as the distance from trawling grounds increases. These results highlight the ability of bottom trawling to resuspend bottom sediments, leading to net erosion of the canyon rims and flanks. In turn, large volumes of sediment are advected towards the canyon's interior, ultimately increasing sediment deposition along the canyon axis. Natural sedimentation rates at similar along-canyon distance from shore in the untrawled continental slope (900-1500 m) and in the lower canyon axis (1500-2200 m) are comparable (0.08-0.20 cmyr(-1)), suggesting distance from coastal sediment sources as the main control on regional sedimentation in deeper parts of the margin. While submarine canyons have been regarded as preferential cross margin conduits for sediment dispersal, they can also potentially function as modern depocenters for trawling induced sedimentation.;"[Paradis, Sarah; Masque, Pere; Garcia-Orellana, Jordi] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Puig, Pere] CSIC, Inst Ciencias Mar, Dept Marine Geosci, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Sanchez-Vidal, Anna; Calafat, Antoni; Canals, Miguel] Univ Barcelona, Fac Ciencies Terra, Dept Dinam Terra & Ocea, GRC Geociencies Marines, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Masque, Pere; Garcia-Orellana, Jordi] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Fis, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Masque, Pere] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Nat Sci, Ctr Marine Ecosyst Res, Joondalup, WA 6027, Australia; [Masque, Pere] Univ Western Australia, Sch Phys, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Masque, Pere] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Inst, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia";;Paradis, S (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals, Bellaterra 08193, Spain.;Sarah.Paradis@uab.cat;"Sanchez-Vidal, Anna/B-6919-2016; Calafat, Antoni/J-5848-2017; Canals, Miquel/F-4922-2013; Paradis, Sarah/F-2814-2017; Masque, Pere/B-7379-2008; Puig, Pere/E-5422-2013; Garcia-Orellana, Jordi/L-7758-2014";"Sanchez-Vidal, Anna/0000-0002-8209-1959; Calafat, Antoni/0000-0001-7927-3105; Canals, Miquel/0000-0001-5267-7601; Paradis, Sarah/0000-0002-7035-0538; Masque, Pere/0000-0002-1789-320X; Puig, Pere/0000-0001-6189-5504; Garcia-Orellana, Jordi/0000-0002-0543-2641";"I-MarCat research project of Institut d'Estudis Catalans (IEC, Catalonia) [PR2015-S06CANALS/SCiT-SCB]; Spanish research project ABIDES [CTM2015-65142-R]; EC DG Environment contract IDEM (Implementation of the MSFD to the DEep Mediterranean Sea); autonomous government of Catalonia, Generalitat de CatalunyaGeneralitat de Catalunya [2014 SGR-1068, 2014 SGR-1642, 2017 SGR-1588]; ICTA 'Unit of Excellence' (MinECo) [MDM2015-0552]; predoctoral F.P.U. grant from the Spanish government;  [REN2002-04556-0O2-01];  [CTM2007-66316-C020-01/MAR];  [CTM2010-21810-C03-03]";This research benefited from samples and data collected during RECS (REN2002-04556-0O2-01), PROMETEO (CTM2007-66316-C020-01/MAR), and DOS MARES (CTM2010-21810-C03-03) research projects.

This study provides a thorough overview on Adriatic purse seine designs and fishing practices. Moreover, since no detailed information was available about their environmental impact, an ad hoc study was also performed to examine the issue in relation to Mediterranean Regulation provisions. Analysis of the technical data confirmed the vast majority of the nets used by the Adriatic purse seine fleet do not comply with regulatory provisions. However, data analysis highlighted that the technical features and operational characteristics of these fisheries do not justify the application of MR restrictions. In fact, i) spatial analysis of the fishing effort demonstrated that purse seiners operate more than 3 nautical miles off the coast, i.e. further than the area covered by the restrictions; and ii) data from sensors and video cameras documented that purse seines do not exert adverse impacts on critical habitats such as Posidonia meadows and that the groundrope impact on the seabed is so slight and short-lived as to be negligible. Moreover, the extensive changes required to make purse seines compliant with the MR would entail steep costs and would ultimately render the nets unsuitable for commercial fishing, thus involving highly negative socioeconomic consequences.";"[Lucchetti, Alessandro; Belardinelli, Andrea; Martinelli, Michela; Virgili, Massimo] Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Biol Resources & Marine Biotechnol IRBIM, Largo Fiera Pesca 1, I-60125 Ancona, Italy; [D'Andrea, Lorenzo; Russo, Tommaso] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Biol, Lab Expt Ecol & Aquaculture, Via Ric Sci Snc, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Marceta, Bojan] Fisheries Res Inst Slovenia, Sp Gameljne 61a, SI-1211 Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Kec, Vanja Cikes; Zorica, Barbara] IOF, Setaliste I Mestrovica 63, Split 21000, Croatia";;Lucchetti, A (corresponding author), Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Biol Resources & Marine Biotechnol IRBIM, Largo Fiera Pesca 1, I-60125 Ancona, Italy.;a.lucchetti@ismar.cnr.it;"Lucchetti, Alessandro/AAV-7188-2020; Martinelli, Michela/N-7760-2013; Russo, Tommaso/C-6157-2014";"Lucchetti, Alessandro/0000-0001-8418-9848; Martinelli, Michela/0000-0003-1231-2346; Russo, Tommaso/0000-0003-4047-959X; D'Andrea, Lorenzo/0000-0002-3795-3601";FAO AdriaMed Project (Scientific Cooperation to Support Responsible Fisheries in the Adriatic Sea);The research work carried out in this study was approved by the Fisheries Administrations of Italy, Croatia, and Slovenia and was financially supported in the framework of the FAO AdriaMed Project (Scientific Cooperation to Support Responsible Fisheries in the Adriatic Sea).

However, this assumption is rarely tested in the field. This study aimed to determine the composition of non-target species that occur in crustacean pots and to assess spatial and temporal differences in catches in the waters around the Isle of Man, Irish Sea. The data were collected using fishery independent surveys and a questionnaire study. Based on fishery independent surveys, a total of five taxonomic groups and 43 species occurred as by-catch. The dominant by-catch species was velvet crab Necora puber. The by-catch per unit effort (BPUE) for all of the non-target species was low particularly in comparison to towed bottom gear fisheries around the Isle of Man. BPUE of species composition varied considerably between different locations around the Isle of Man. The results of both the fishery independent and questionnaire data suggested that the by-catch rates varied with season with peak BPUE occurring in spring which then declined into autumn and winter. By-catch composition did not decrease significantly with an increasing target species catch. Overall, by-catch was low relative to target species catch which may be partially attributable to the use of escape panels in pot fisheries in the Isle of Man.;"[Ondes, Fikret; Kaiser, Michel J.; Murray, Lee G.] Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Anglesey, Wales; [Ondes, Fikret] Izmir Katip Celebi Univ, Fac Fisheries, TR-35620 Izmir, Cigli, Turkey";;"Ondes, F (corresponding author), Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Anglesey, Wales.; Ondes, F (corresponding author), Izmir Katip Celebi Univ, Fac Fisheries, TR-35620 Izmir, Cigli, Turkey.";fikret.ondes@ikc.edu.tr;;"Ondes, Fikret/0000-0002-9522-7050; Kaiser, Michel Josef/0000-0001-8782-3621";"Ministry of National Education, Republic of TurkeyMinistry of National Education - Turkey; Department of Environment, Food and Agriculture (DEFA), the Isle of Man Government";This study was funded by the Ministry of National Education, Republic of Turkey (awarded to F.O .) and the Department of Environment, Food and Agriculture (DEFA), the Isle of Man Government (awarded to M.J.K.).;58;4;5;0;10;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;NEW YORK;32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA;0025-3154;1469-7769;J MAR BIOL ASSOC UK;J.

The aim of this study was to characterise the spatio-temporal structure of the Catalan purse seiner fishing effort directed towards anchovy or sardine, which was estimated by filtering VMS data (from 2012 to 2014) by species and seasons. The results showed that the mean location of the fishing effort directed towards anchovy did not vary among the summer seasons, in contrast to the efforts in spring and autumn, whereas the mean location of the effort directed towards sardine was constant over the seasons. The concentration curves indicated that similar fishing effort patterns occurred during all seasons when directed towards sardine, whereas the effort directed towards anchovy was more concentrated in summer. The ranges of the variograms indicated that the fishing effort directed towards both species formed patches. The dimensions of these patches changed from season to season, with the smallest magnitudes during the summer seasons. In this study, a seasonal distribution pattern of the fishing efforts was recognised that adequately captured the features of the distributions of small pelagic populations.;"[Quattrocchi, Federico; Maynou, Francesc] CSIC, Inst Ciencias Mar, Barcelona, Spain";;Quattrocchi, F (corresponding author), CSIC, Inst Ciencias Mar, Barcelona, Spain.;quattrocchi@icm.csic.es;;;"European Commission's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme [634495]; Fisheries Department of the Catalonian Autonomous Government";"European Commission's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme, Grant/Award Number: 634495; Fisheries Department of the Catalonian Autonomous Government";52;4;4;4;11;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0969-997X;1365-2400;FISHERIES MANAG ECOL;Fisheries Manag.

Prey availability may in turn be affected by bottom trawling. Our study attempted to link the prey consumed by fish directly to those available in the benthic environment. We test the hypothesis that bottom trawling significantly affected the trait composition of fish diets with a strong link to benthic habitats. Stomach content data were analysed for seven demersal and benthivorous fish species in the southern and central North Sea and were related to habitat fauna collected by grab and epi-benthic trawl data across the same spatial extent. Biological trait analysis was used to avoid taxonomic bias in large-scale comparisons across habitats and to quantify the effect of bottom trawling, which tends to shift prey diversity in favour of small, opportunistic and short-lived species and traits. The diets of two demersal omnivores (whiting, Merlangius merlangus and Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua) and two opportunistic benthivores (haddock, Melanograrnmus aegiefinus and long-rough dab, Hippoglossoides platessoides) did not appear to reflect either infaunal or epifaunal traits that were abundant in the benthic environment. The diets of European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and Dover sole (Solea soled), however, showed strong links with infaunal prey trait composition in shallow sand to muddy sand habitats located in the eastern North Sea and the Dogger Bank. Such strong links were also observed for the diets of Common dab (Limanda limanda) and plaice in similar habitats in deeper waters. Plaice targeted small to medium sized infaunal burrowers and deeper dwelling infaunal species. Its diet was significantly affected by bottom trawling, which caused a reduction in prey biomass in their stomachs rather than a shift in trait composition. Our study showed that the diets of benthivorous fish across large spatial scales are strongly linked with the prey trait availability in their benthic habitats and that bottom trawling significantly affected the diet of plaice, a species with strong habitat-diet associations.;"[Eggleton, Jacqueline D.; Kenny, Andrew J.; Bolam, Stefan G.; Garcia, Clement] Cefas, Pakefield Rd, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England; [Depestele, Jochen] Flanders Res Inst Agr Fisheries & Food ILVO, Ankerstr 1, B-8400 Oostende, Belgium";;Eggleton, JD (corresponding author), Cefas, Pakefield Rd, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England.;jacqueline.eggleton@cefas.co.uk;Depestele, Jochen/X-3276-2019;Depestele, Jochen/0000-0001-7554-553X;"BENTHIS FP7 Project [KBBE-CALL6-312088]; Cefas; DefraDepartment for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) [ME5301]";"This work was funded under the BENTHIS FP7 Project: Grant agreement KBBE-CALL6-312088; http://www.benthis.eu/en/benthis.htm).The authors would like to acknowledge Cefas for providing matched funding and all data providers.

This configuration produced 19% discards in weight. The modifications researched were of two kinds: a guarding net consisting of a 2.5-mesh-high (200 mm stretched mesh) net between the footrope and the trammel net and artificial lights of two colours (white or green) mounted on the floating ropes. Catches were identified, measured and categorized (commercial, discards and reason for discarding), and the different configurations were tested for statistical differences. Our results show that trammel net deployments with guarding net produce 32% higher catches of commercial species and as much as 95% higher catches of the target cuttlefish. Artificial lights produced a low but significant increase in total catches of commercial species of 13%, with no differences due to light colour. The amount of discards in deployments with guarding net was 6%, i.e. ca. 1/4 of the amount produced by the standard configuration.

This specialized and profitable fishery is affected by unwanted catches that generate high discard rates and damage to the nets, with environmental impacts and costs for fishermen. The experimental study consisted in comparing the catches of a standard trammel net (STN) with those of two experimental trammel nets, e.g. STNs provided with a guarding net of 19 cm (TGN20) and 24 cm height (TGN25), respectively. The guarding net, a strip of gillnet placed at the bottom of the net, can be considered a by-catch reducer device (BRD). Some fishermen of the investigated fishery have been using this device for several years. The results of the 15 experimental fishing trials performed from June to July 2016 indicate that the guarding nets significantly reduce discards (e.g. crabs and other invertebrates); the biomass of the unwanted species caught was 75% lower than that produced by the STN. The catch rates of the target species obtained with TGN20 and TGN25 were also significantly lower than those of the STN, though of a lesser amount.

Long thought to be occasional vagrants outside its known range in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, we ask if this rare and understudied labrid has expanded its range and become established in Swedish waters. A recent surge in verified angling records in the Swedish Anglers Association's specimen database Storfiskregistret provides information to suggest that this species should no longer be considered an occasional guest, but rather a species established in the Swedish parts of Skagerrak. These records are supported by additional personal communications with anglers. The species is currently well spread geographically along the Swedish Skagerrak coast, with many locations providing repeated captures of adult fish over multiple years. The typical Swedish catch sites are rocky reefs located between the general 40- and 80-m depth curves, likely influenced by currents bringing higher-salinity water from the North Sea. The present study show that angling records can provide an important, but underutilized, resource for mapping the distribution of data-deficient fish species.;"[Naslund, Joacim] Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, Stockholm, Sweden; [Lundgren, Markus] Swedish Anglers Assoc, Gothenburg, Sweden";;Naslund, J (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, Stockholm, Sweden.;joacim.naslund@gmail.com;Naslund, Joacim/Q-1734-2015;Naslund, Joacim/0000-0003-1091-2225;;;60;3;3;1;2;PEERJ INC;LONDON;341-345 OLD ST, THIRD FLR, LONDON, EC1V 9LL, ENGLAND;2167-8359;;PEERJ;PeerJ;Nov/06;2018;6;;;;;;;e5900;10.7717/peerj.5900;;;15;Multidisciplinary Sciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Science & Technology - Other Topics;HD2FR;WOS:000452327000011;30416890;Green Submitted, gold, Green Published;;;10/01/2022

Although the impacts of mobile gear are well known, effects of passive gear (e.g. fish traps) upon structure have been little studied. We modified commercial traps for American lobster Homarus americanus and black sea bass Centropristis striata by attaching GoPro (R) cameras to ascertain the degree and nature of impacts to seafloor habitats. Customized traps were included within a line of 20 traps, deployed and retrieved according to standard commercial fishing practice. Less than 5% of traps landed directly on bedforms when deployed. However, during retrieval traps dragged along the ocean floor, increasing trap-habitat contact rate to 50%, and causing traps to collide with corals, bryozoans, and other epifauna. Drag time of traps depended on the position in the trap line. Experimentally extending the trap line reduced drag time during retrieval for traps near the distal end of the line. Our results show that impacts of commercial trap fishing can be substantial during trap retrieval, and that the impact depends on their location on a trap line. Fishing practices should be developed that minimize effects of trap retrieval on structural benthic habitat.;"[Schweitzer, Cara C.; Stevens, Bradley G.] Univ Maryland Eastern Shore, Dept Nat Sci, Princess Anne, MD 21853 USA; [Lipcius, Romuald N.] Coll William & Mary, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Dept Fisheries Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA";;Schweitzer, CC (corresponding author), Univ Maryland Eastern Shore, Dept Nat Sci, Princess Anne, MD 21853 USA.;cschweitzer@umes.edu;;Schweitzer, Cara/0000-0002-7787-5839;"NOAA Bycatch Reduction Engineering Program (BREP) [NA13NMF4720273]; NOAANational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [NA11SEC4810002]";"The authors thank captains C. and W.

In this context, the spatiotemporal patterns of fishing effort from Greek trawlers operating in the eastern Mediterranean were studied using Vessel Monitoring System data over a 6-year period (2010-2015). The exploratory analysis of the data consisted of spatial auto-correlation techniques assessing clusters of high fishing effort (hotspots). Cycles, seasonality, trends, and the inter/intra-annual persistence of hotspots were also examined. The spatiotemporal association between the fishing effort (fine-scale: 5 x 5 km, monthly basis) and environmental/economic variables (depth, chlorophyll-a, fuel price, distance from port) was investigated through Generalized Additive Modelling. The results revealed higher fishing effort at depths <250 m, at distances between 15 and 55 km from the departure port and in areas of relatively high primary productivity. In winter, fishing effort was observed in shallower waters while during mid/late spring in deeper strata. In autumn, the effort was higher than any other season. Fishing effort was negatively correlated with fuel price and a decrease was noticeable during 2012-2013, the period of fuel price peaks.

In this fishery, many trawlers redeploy the trawl directly after taking the catch onboard in an attempt to secure a continuous supply of fish and avoid any unnecessary stops during processing. If the approximate desired amount of fish is caught or exceeded before the catch from the previous haul is processed, the trawl is lifted off the seabed and towed at a given depth at low speed, usually -1-2 knots, until the production capacity of the onboard factory is restored. Both researchers and fishermen onboard trawlers believe that buffer towing has a negative impact on fish quality, as indicated by increased frequency of gear marks and dead fish, poorer exsanguination, ecchymosis, skin abrasion, fillet gaping, and fillet redness. However, the effect that buffer towing has on fish quality has not been scientifically evaluated. The aim of this study was to document the effects of buffer towing on fish quality. The quality was assessed using two different indexes, one for whole cod and one for cod fillets. The results proved that buffer towing has a negative impact on fish quality. Specifically, cod subjected to buffer towing, in contrast to direct haul-back, had an increased relative probability of 371% for poor exsanguination and an increased relative probability of 209% for fillet redness. Furthermore, combining scores of the different quality categories within the indexes (e.g., gear marks, ecchymosis, poor exsanguination, and skin abrasion) proved a significant reduction in the quality of cod subjected to buffer towing.;"[Brinkhof, Jesse; Larsen, Roger B.; Herrmann, Bent] Arctic Univ Norway UIT, Hansine Hansens Veg 18, N-9019 Tromso, Norway; [Herrmann, Bent] SINTEF Ocean, Fishing Gear Technol, Willemoesvej 2, DK-9850 Hirtshals, Denmark; [Olsen, Stein H.] Nofima AS, Muninbakken 9-13,POB 6122, N-9291 Tromso, Norway";;Brinkhof, J (corresponding author), Arctic Univ Norway UIT, Hansine Hansens Veg 18, N-9019 Tromso, Norway.;jesse.brinkhof@uit.no;Larsen, Roger B./AAY-4314-2021;Herrmann, Bent/0000-0003-1325-6198;"Norwegian Research Council through the project Centre of Research-based Innovation in Sustainable Fish Capture and Processing Technology (CRISP) [203477]; Arctic University of Norway";The Norwegian Research Council (Grant No. 203477) funded this study through the project Centre of Research-based Innovation in Sustainable Fish Capture and Processing Technology (CRISP).

A retainer bag was attached behind the footrope of the trawl, and the number of fish that were overrun by the trawl was compared with the catch in the trawl cod end. The catch efficiency increased slightly for larger Haddock for both groundgears. The SCSG was found to have a significantly higher catch efficiency than the conventional rockhopper groundgear. The estimated improvement in catch efficiency varied between 4.5% and 12.3%, with an equivalent reduction in escape rate underneath the groundgear of more than 70%. The rockhopper groundgear can have a catch efficiency as low as 76%, corresponding with values reported in previous studies. Average catch efficiency for the rockhopper gear was significantly lower during the night in comparison with the daytime. No such difference was found with the SCSG. The SCSG is more efficient for catching Haddock, and it is lighter than the rockhopper groundgear. Both are important factors in reducing seabed impact and fuel consumption. When compared to results of a similar study on Atlantic Cod Gadus morhua, we found that in general, both groundgears had a greater catch efficiency for Haddock, which accords with differences in behavior between the two species.;"[Larsen, Roger B.; Herrmann, Bent; Brinkhof, Jesse; Tatone, Ivan] Univ Tromso, Norwegian Coll Fisheries & Aquat Sci, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Herrmann, Bent] SINTEF Ocean, Willemoesvej 2, DK-9850 Hirtshals, Denmark; [Grimaldo, Eduardo; Sistiaga, Manu] SINTEF Ocean, Brattorkaia 17C, N-7010 Trondheim, Norway";;Larsen, RB (corresponding author), Univ Tromso, Norwegian Coll Fisheries & Aquat Sci, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.;roger.larsen@uit.no;Larsen, Roger B./AAY-4314-2021;"Herrmann, Bent/0000-0003-1325-6198; Grimaldo, Eduardo/0000-0003-2690-9477";"Arctic University of Norway; Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries; Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway [216423/O70]";We thank the Arctic University of Norway, the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries, and the Research Council of Norway (Project Number 216423/O70) for assistance in providing necessary permits and financial support.

As a result, trawl samples still hold a great potential to reveal information about deep-water biodiversity. 2 The rare Mediterranean CWC species Placogorgia coronata was repeatedly found in the bottom trawl discards of the red shrimp fishery in Santa Margherita Ligure ( Ligurian Sea). The supposed rarity of this species is strongly biased by taxonomic problems within the genus as well as by the limited exploration of these deep habitats. 3 Scientific literature as well as remotely operated vehicle surveys highlighted the presence, in the investigated trawled area, of a dead white coral framework, supporting the hypothesis that the CWC studied, probably thriving on coral rubble, occurs here due to the natural protection to trawling offered by the coral matrix. Trawlers, however, may accidentally affect these secondary hard grounds, as demonstrated by the discard content. 4 The long-term monitoring of the catches highlighted a removal rate of up to one colony every two trawling operations; based on the anecdotal fishing effort in this area and the status of the discarded specimens, it is possible to estimate an average catch rate of about 18 live colonies per year per fisherman. 5 The occurrence of rare CWC species with low resilience to fishing disturbance is among the required information for the identification of fishing restriction zones designed to protect deep vulnerable marine ecosystems.";"[Enrichetti, Francesco; Bavestrello, Giorgio; Coppari, Martina; Betti, Federico; Bo, Marzia] Univ Genoa, Dipartimento Studio Terra Ambiente & Vita DISTAV, Genoa, Italy; [Bavestrello, Giorgio; Bo, Marzia] Consorzio Nazl Interuniv Sci Mare CoNISMa, Rome, Italy";;Enrichetti, F (corresponding author), Univ Genoa, DISTAV, Corso Europa 26, I-16132 Genoa, Italy.;fraenrichetti@gmail.com;;"BETTI, Federico/0000-0002-5492-2655; COPPARI, MARTINA/0000-0002-3178-9409";"SIR-MIUR_BIOMOUNT Project (Biodiversity patterns of the Tyrrhenian Seamounts) [RBSI14HC9O]; Marine Strategy Framework";"Marine Strategy Framework; SIR-MIUR_BIOMOUNT Project (Biodiversity patterns of the Tyrrhenian Seamounts), Grant/Award Number: RBSI14HC9O";73;6;6;1;13;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1052-7613;1099-0755;AQUAT CONSERV;Aquat.

The analysis of sea trout captures was based on tagging and recapture data collected in 1998-2011, while whitefish data were derived from individual samples of commercial fisheries from the same period. The mesh sizes used in gill-net fishing and the seasonal and temporal distributions of recaptured sea trout and sampled whitefish were compared in the northern and southern Gulf of Bothnia. The trout had typically spent 1-2years at sea, and they were mainly immature with a median body length of 40-43cm at the time of recapture in gill nets. Despite the increase in the minimum permitted landing size from 40 to 50cm in 2008, the median length of recaptured trout remained unchanged during the study period. Most (59%) of the gillnetted trout were caught in the southern Gulf of Bothnia in gill nets with mesh sizes of 40-45mm, which were also used in the whitefish fishery (72%). In the northern Gulf of Bothnia, nets with a smaller mesh size of 25-39mm took 83% of the whitefish catch and 39% from recaptured trout. In both areas, the overlap in mesh sizes used to gill-net catch whitefish and sea trout increased during the study period. There were clear seasonal and areal differences in the relative probability of sea trout being captured in gill nets, suggesting that carefully tailored spatial and temporal restrictions on gill-net fisheries could provide a tool to protect young sea trout without causing intolerable difficulties for the fisheries targeting other species.;"[Kallio-Nyberg, Irma; Veneranta, Lari] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Vaasa, Finland; [Saloniemi, Irma] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Turku, Finland; [Salminen, Matti] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Helsinki, Finland";;Kallio-Nyberg, I (corresponding author), Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Vaasa, Finland.;irma.kallio-nyberg@luke.fi;;Kallio-Nyberg, Irma/0000-0001-9149-4461;"Strategic Research Council of the Academy of Finland; National Data Collection Programme under Council Regulation (EC) [199/2008]; SmartSea project; Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission; Luke";"Luke; Strategic Research Council of the Academy of Finland; National Data Collection Programme under Council Regulation (EC) No 199/2008; SmartSea project; Strategic Research Council; Academy of Finland";37;3;3;0;2;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0175-8659;1439-0426;J APPL ICHTHYOL;J.

Therefore, understanding the influence of codend mesh size and shape on the size selection of European hake is critical for defining technical measures for fisheries targeting this species. Based on morphology data collected on European hake, the influence of mesh size and shape on bottom trawl codend size selectivity was investigated by simulation using the FISHSELECT methodology successfully applied previously for other species. The predicted size selection for European hake was found to agree well with previous experimental results for a wide range of mesh sizes if it was assumed that the codend meshes had a relatively small opening angle, between 20 degrees and 40 degrees, during trawling. This study enables detailed prediction of size selectivity for European hake and offers a potential explanation for previous experimental size selectivity results.;"[Tokac, Adnan] Ege Univ, Fac Fisheries, TR-35100 Izmir, Turkey; [Herrmann, Bent] SINTEF Ocean, Fishing Gear Technol, Willemoesvej 2, DK-9850 Hirtshals, Denmark; [Herrmann, Bent] Univ Tromso, Norwegian Coll Fishery & Aquat Sci, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Gokce, Gokhan] Cukurova Univ, Fac Fisheries, TR-01330 Adana, Turkey; [Krag, Ludvig Ahm] Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Aqua, North Sea Sci Pk, DK-9850 Hirtshals, Denmark; [Nezhad, Davud Sadegh] Ege Univ, Grad Sch Nat & Appl Sci, Dept Fisheries, TR-35100 Izmir, Turkey";;Tokac, A (corresponding author), Ege Univ, Fac Fisheries, TR-35100 Izmir, Turkey.;"adnan.tokac@ege.edu.tr; bent.herrmann@sintef.no; gokhan.gokce@ymail.com; lak@aqua.dtu.dk; davut.sn@gmail.com";"Tokac, Adnan/A-2409-2016; Gokce, Gokhan/E-8278-2016";"Tokac, Adnan/0000-0002-2968-7315; Gokce, Gokhan/0000-0003-1830-0733; Herrmann, Bent/0000-0003-1325-6198; Krag, Ludvig Ahm/0000-0002-1531-1499";Science and Technology Centre of Ege UniversityEge University [2016 / SUF/008];This study was conducted by the Science and Technology Centre of Ege University (Project no 2016 / SUF/008).

We evaluate whether environmental and climatic variability, measured from operational oceanographic data, allow assessment of discarded species abundances. Monthly data collected by onboard fishery observers during 2011 and 2012 in the Northern Alboran Sea served as a case study of the trawling fishery's dynamics. The study area was split into west and east zones to account for differences in the Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea water influences, for distinct geomorphology and for species composition of catches. Sixteen species divided in three groups were analysed: species without discards, those partially discarded and those completely discarded. Applying Gaussian Generalized Additive Models (GAM), we tested the relationships of standard oceanographic data products and climatic variability with discard abundances. These variables were sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll a (chl-a) from satellite imagery, as indicators of environmental conditions, and the North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO) as a climatic indicator. Models were applied for target and bycatch species partially discarded. These were the following species: gadoid like European hake (Merluccius merluccius), Blue Whiting (Micromesistius poutassou), Seabreams (Pagellus acarne, and Pagellus erythrinus), and Mackerels (Trachurus mediterraneus, Trachurus picturatus and Trachurus trachurus). Surface seawater temperature was a relevant variable in coastal and eastern, more haline Mediterranean waters. Climatic variability represented by NAO was useful for assessing discard rates in the more productive western zone. Chlorophyll a showed less relevance for discard prediction models, but it was more related in the coastal zones. Including oceanographic data products and climatic patterns in GAM models of fishery discards provides a new perspective that may improve our predictive capabilities for management decisions.

This study describes an approach to map the spatiotemporal distribution of bottom trawl discards taking into account on-board observer data, environmental information and high-resolution estimates of fishing effort derived from Vessel Monitoring System data. Two were the main objectives: i) mapping the Discards Per Unit Effort (DPUE: kg/h) and ii) mapping the total discards quantities (in kg) in a predefined spatial unit (grid cell of 5 x 5 km). For this purpose, discards data from commercial bottom trawlers (seasonal basis, period 2003-2006, 2008) operating on the continental shelf of the eastern Ionian Sea were analyzed. The DPUE for a) all species with Minimum Landing Size (MLS), b) all species without MLS and c) all fish species, were modeled by means of Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) using satellite environmental parameters, bathymetry and season as independent covariates. Mapping discards quantities in a predefined spatial unit was based on the spatial overlapping between GAM estimates for the year 2010 and fishing effort distribution for the same year. Spatial clusters of high discard quantities (hot spots) and their spatiotemporal persistence were also investigated. Results revealed how the environmental and temporal factors influence the DPUE distribution of each discard group and indicated increased discards quantities in areas of high fishing effort. The potential implications of the resulting DPUE maps for advancing discards spatial mitigation are further discussed. Mapping discards quantities using both the DPUE and the fishing effort distribution provide valuable insights that can be useful to investigate the broader ecosystem consequences of the EU landing obligation and other potential fishery management policies.;"[Maina, I; Kavadas, S.; Machias, A.; Tsagarakis, K.] HCMR, IMBRIW, Athens 19013, Greece; [Maina, I] Univ Aegean, Dept Marine Sci, Sch Environm, Univ Hill, Mitilini 81100, Lesvos, Greece; [Giannoulaki, M.] HCMR, IMBRIW, POB 2214, Iraklion, Crete, Greece";;Maina, I (corresponding author), HCMR, IMBRIW, Athens 19013, Greece.;imaina@hcmr.gr;Tsagarakis, Konstantinos/A-1283-2012;"Tsagarakis, Konstantinos/0000-0003-2408-0220; Kavadas, Stefanos/0000-0003-3473-9084";"Greece (General Secretariat for Research and Technology); European Union under the Operational Program Education and Lifelong Learning [4794]";"This work is part of the PhD thesis Methods to analyze VMS data and the expected contribution in sustainability of Greek fishery resources conducted in the Department of Marine Sciences of University of the Aegean.

Simulations were performed using a dynamic state variable model of effort allocation for the Basque trawl fleet, assuming that the landing obligation had been implemented in 2012. The three implementations of the landing obligation involved different policy arrangements: (i) quota increases; (ii) international swapping of quotas; and (iii) interspecies quota flexibility. All three scenarios resulted in changes to fishing patterns caused by choke species and improved selectivity of harvest, but also resulted in a negative short-term impact on the economic performance of the fleet. We report average reductions in net revenue of up to 60% when compared with results obtained under a no landing obligation scenario. Our model results suggested that these negative short-term impacts could be alleviated by incorporation of inter-species quota flexibility in the implementation of the landing obligation. Our results indicate that there will be a strong incentive to use this policy arrangement to alleviate the choke effect problem where species with limiting quotas constrain the fishery.";"[Alzorriz, Nekane; Jardim, Ernesto] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Sustainable Resources Directorate, Water & Marine Resources Uni4, Via Enrico Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy; [Alzorriz, Nekane; Poos, Jan Jaap] Wageningen Marine Res, POB 68, NL-1970 AB Ijmuiden, Netherlands";;Alzorriz, N (corresponding author), European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Sustainable Resources Directorate, Water & Marine Resources Uni4, Via Enrico Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy.;nekane.alzorriz@gmail.com;Jardim, Ernesto/X-9764-2019;Jardim, Ernesto/0000-0003-4695-825X;;;28;6;6;0;10;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0165-7836;1872-6763;FISH RES;Fish Res.;SEP;2018;205;;;;;86;95;;10.1016/j.fishres.2018.04.004;;;10;Fisheries;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Fisheries;GH7RM;WOS:000433651100011;;hybrid;;;10/01/2022

Using fuzzy coded biological traits, we compared the functional composition, diversity and evenness of benthic communities in the English Channel and in the Celtic and Irish Seas across interacting gradients of bottom trawling and primary production. Fuzzy correspondence analysis indicated greater similarity in trait composition at sites of high trawling pressure than at those of low trawling. In contrast, the analysis revealed no relationship between trait composition and primary production. Trawling and primary production had no effect on the traits 'longevity', 'sediment position', or 'feeding mode'. However, trawling had negative effects on all modalities within the trait 'living habit', and these effects were strongest for attached and epifaunal organisms but weakest for burrow- and tube-dwelling species. Trawling also negatively affected most modalities within the trait 'maximum weight', with strongest effects for organisms weighing between <0.1 g and up to 1 kg. Conversely, trawling positively affected organisms weighing >10 kg. For the trait 'bioturbation', upward conveyors were positively related with primary production, whilst other modalities exhibited no clear pattern. Because trawling affected some traits more than others, community biomass was less evenly distributed across traits in highly trawled areas, which resulted in lower levels of functional diversity and evenness. Overall, the effects of bottom trawling were greater in areas of high primary production.;"[Howarth, L. M.; Waggitt, J. J.; Hiddink, J.

The effect of such a ban on discards on top marine predators such as seabirds is largely unknown, especially in oligotrophic systems of the Mediterranean. The current study investigates the presence of scavenging seabirds around fishing trawlers as well as the exploitation of discards produced by bottom trawlers in the eastern Ionian Sea. Methods: On-board observations were randomly conducted in May and December 2014, in order to record the presence and use of fishery discards by two common seabird species, namely, Scopoli's Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea) and the Yellow-legged Gull (Larus michahellis). Results: A total of 3400 seabirds were counted during May of which 2190 individuals were Scopoli's Shearwaters and 1210 were Yellow-legged Gulls. The latter species was the only scavenger observed during winter and in total, 768 individuals were counted. Differences in species abundance in the study area are related to breeding phenology and migratory movements. The number of seabirds attending bottom trawler operations during morning and afternoon hours showed no significant differences for both seabird species. Both scavenging seabirds extensively exploited fishery discards, which were mainly demersal fish, and consumed 70-80% of the total fishery discards biomass; however, they appeared to avoid poisonous species and/or large-sized fish. Yellow-legged Gulls displayed kleptoparasitic behaviour on Scopoli's Shearwater during feeding experiments. The number of such incidents depended on the number of gulls around the fishing vessel, with more than 90% success rates. Conclusions: Considering the average annual biomass of discards estimations and the consumption rate found in this work, 106.1-117.9 t may be offered as a food subsidy to scavenging seabirds in the study area and should support a substantial part of local populations. Our results constitute baseline information on the annual amount of fishery discards and their exploitation rate by seabirds in the Ionian Sea, and suggest further work for a complete understanding of the potential impacts of the discards reform bill on seabirds.";"[Karris, Georgios] TEI Ionian Isl, Dept Environm Technol, Panagoula 29100, Zakynthos, Greece; [Ketsilis-Rinis, Vlasis; Kalogeropoulou, Anastasia] Univ Patras, Dept Biol, Patras 26500, Greece; [Xirouchakis, Stavros] Nat Hist Museum Crete, POB 2208, Iraklion 71409, Greece; [Machias, Athanasios; Maina, Irida; Kavadas, Stefanos] Hellenic Ctr Marine Res, Inst Marine Biol Resources & Inland Waters, 46-7 Km Athens Sounio Ave, Attiki 19013, Greece";;Karris, G (corresponding author), TEI Ionian Isl, Dept Environm Technol, Panagoula 29100, Zakynthos, Greece.;gkarris@teiion.gr;Karris, G./H-7996-2019;"Karris, G./0000-0001-5264-8026; Kavadas, Stefanos/0000-0003-3473-9084";"NSRF; European UnionEuropean Commission; Greek GovernmentGreek Ministry of Development-GSRT; European UnionEuropean Commission [199/2008/EU]";The study performed within the framework of the ECODISC project, entitled ECOsystem effect of fisheries DISCards, partially funded by the NSRF 2007-2013 Operational Programme Education and Lifelong Learning, which is co-financed by Greece and the European Union.

To investigate how trawling pressure is affecting the macrofaunal assemblages, we compared the standing stock (abundance and biomass), community structure and taxonomical and trophic diversity in areas subjected to varying trawling pressure along the SW Portuguese upper slope, between 200 and 600 m. In addition to trawling pressure, several environmental variables, namely depth, grain size and organic matter, were correlated with the biological component, which suggest that the longstanding trawling pressure presents cumulative effects to the habitat heterogeneity known to characterise the West Iberian Margin fauna. Furthermore, our results showed a depletion of macro-infaunal abundances in both the fishing ground and the adjacent area (up to 3 times lower), when compared to the area not trawled. The observed decrease in abundance with increasing trawling pressure was also associated with a loss of species and trophic richness, but univariate diversity indices related with community structure (i.e. Shannon-Wiener index, Pielou's evenness) failed to detect consistent differences across areas. Also observed was a decrease in the number of taxa - trophic guilds combinations of the core assemblage (i.e. characteristic, dominant or frequent taxa) with increasing trawling pressure. We suggest that, in disturbed sediments, the lower functional redundancy resulting from the loss of species within most feeding guilds increases the vulnerability of trophic interactions and therefore of the whole assemblage to further increases in natural and anthropogenic disturbance or their synergistic effects.;"[Ramalho, Sofia P.; Almeida, Mariana; Esquete, Patricia; Genio, Luciana; Ravara, Ascensao; Rodrigues, Clara F.; Cunha, Marina R.] Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Ramalho, Sofia P.; Almeida, Mariana; Esquete, Patricia; Genio, Luciana; Ravara, Ascensao; Rodrigues, Clara F.; Cunha, Marina R.] Univ Aveiro, Ctr Estudos Ambiente & Mar CESAM, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Ramalho, Sofia P.; Vanreusel, Ann] Univ Ghent, Marine Biol Res Grp, Dept Biol, Krijgslaan 281-S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Lampadariou, Nikolaos] Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Oceanog, POB 2214, Iraklion 71003, Crete, Greece";;"Ramalho, SP (corresponding author), Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.; Ramalho, SP (corresponding author), Univ Aveiro, Ctr Estudos Ambiente & Mar CESAM, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.";sofia.pinto.ramalho@gmail.com;"Esquete, Patricia/AAY-2283-2020; Cunha, Marina R/B-7644-2008; Rodrigues, Clara F./A-4536-2009; Esquete, Patricia/AAE-2241-2020; Almeida, Mariana/G-5683-2018; Ramalho, Sofia P/F-3028-2015; Ravara, Ascensao/C-6613-2018";"Cunha, Marina R/0000-0001-8833-6980; Rodrigues, Clara F./0000-0002-3426-8342; Esquete, Patricia/0000-0002-9595-1524; Almeida, Mariana/0000-0002-0615-2318; Ramalho, Sofia P/0000-0001-8714-4696; Ravara, Ascensao/0000-0002-1689-2985";"CESAM - Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)/MEC [UID/AMB/50017]; FEDER, within the PT2020 Partnership Agreement; Compete 2020; MARES Grant; Ghent UniversityGhent University [FPA 2011-0016]; FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [SFRH/BPD/107805/2015, SFRH/BPD/94985/2013, SFRH/BPD/112408/2015, SFRH/BPD/96142/2013]";The authors thank all scientific parties, the captain and the crew during the RV Belgica 2013/17 and RV Belgica 2014/15 cruises.

However, the landing obligation will not apply for species with scientific evidence of high survival rates. Discards estimates usually assume that the whole discarded catch is dead or dies at sea. However, survival of individuals discarded at sea is substantial for several species. In the Mediterranean Sea, the information on this issue is very limited. The aim of this study is to perform a preliminary assessment of the short-term survival of discards in the multi-species bottom trawl fishery in the Eastern Ionian Sea, Greece. Experimental fishing was held in spring when no water column stratification was observed and in autumn when a seasonal thermocline was formed. The catch was sorted, the regularly discarded species/sizes were put in tanks and their survival was monitored in specific time intervals up to 72hr. A seasonal effect was obvious with high mortality in autumn being attributed to high water temperatures. Survival was low or zero for most species, but was relatively high for certain species (e.g., annular seabream, Diplodus annularis (Linnaeus, 1758); European conger, Conger conger (Linnaeus, 1758); brown comber, Serranus hepatus (Linnaeus, 1758) among bony fishes) and broad taxonomic categories (elasmobranchs and most invertebrates) in spring or in both seasons. Poor survival was generally estimated for most species subject to the landing obligation (e.g., hake, Merluccius merluccius (Linnaeus, 1758)).

However, small-sized fish species and juveniles still pass through the grid and enter the codend, along with the targeted shrimp. This bycatch of small fish has a negative impact on the ecosystem due to increased fish mortality, and leads to additional sorting work onboard. Some small-sized fish that enter the trawl avoid entering the codend by escaping through the outlet above the grid, without making contact with the grid itself. Design changes that promote this behavior could potentially reduce bycatch in shrimp trawl fisheries. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) mounted around the escape outlet have previously been found to have either a negative effect, or no effect at all, on fish bycatch species. This study investigates the effect of mounting green LEDs on the lower part of a Nordmore grid, to determine if their presence would encourage bycatch fish to rise towards the escape outlet prior to contacting the grid. Experimental fishing trials were conducted to assess the size selective properties of a 19 mm bar spaced Nordmore grid with and without LEDs, mounted on a bottom trawl targeting Deep-water shrimp (Pandalus borealis). For the four bycatch species investigated, 51-100% of small fish passed through the Nordmore grid. The addition of green LEDs to the Nordmore grid did not significantly affect the escape probability or the size selectivity of any of the investigated species. Very few Deep-water shrimp were found to escape through the escape outlet independent of the presence of the LEDs mounted on the grid.;"[Larsen, Roger B.; Herrmann, Bent; Brinkhof, Jesse; Tatone, Ivan] Arctic Univ Norway, UiT, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Herrmann, Bent; Sistiaga, Manu; Brinkhof, Jesse] SINTEF Fisheries & Aquaculture, Brattorkaia 17C, N-7010 Trondheim, Norway; [Brcic, Jure] Univ Split, Dept Marine Studies, Split 21000, Croatia";;Larsen, RB (corresponding author), Arctic Univ Norway, UiT, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.;roger.larsen@uit.no;"Brcic, Jure/D-4337-2017; Larsen, Roger B./AAY-4314-2021";Herrmann, Bent/0000-0003-1325-6198;"Arctic University of Norway (UiT); Norwegian Seafood Research Fund [901303]; Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries";We thank the crew of RV Helmer Hanssen and Richard Buvang, Frode Gerhardsen, Helene Gjesteland, Tom Andreassen, Hanna Danielsen and Kristoffer Andreassen for valuable assistance on board.

Temporal variability in environmental performance of fisheries has only recently begun to be explored, but only between years, not within a year. Our aim was to better understand the causes of temporal variability within and between years and to identify improvement options through management at a company level and in fisheries management. We analyzed the variability in broad environmental impacts of a demersal freeze trawler targeting cod, haddock, saithe, and shrimp, mainly in the Norwegian Sea and in the Barents Sea. The analysis was based on daily data for fishing activities between 2011 and 2014 and the functional unit was a kilo of landing from one fishing trip. We used biological indicators in a novel hierarchic approach, depending on data availability, to quantify biotic impacts. Landings were categorized as target (having defined target reference points) or bycatch species (classified as threatened or as data-limited). Indicators for target and bycatch impacts were quantified for each fishing trip, as was the seafloor area swept. No significant difference in fuel use was found between years, but variability was considerable within a year, i.e., between fishing trips. Trips targeting shrimp were more fuel intensive than those targeting fish, due to a lower catch rate. Steaming to and from port was less important for fuel efficiency than steaming between fishing locations. A tradeoff was identified between biotic and abiotic impacts. Landings classified as main target species generally followed the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) framework, and proportions of threatened species were low, while proportions of data-limited bycatch were larger. This improved considerably when reference points were defined for saithe in 2014. The variability between fishing trips shows that there is room for improvement through management. Fuel use per landing was strongly influenced by target species, fishing pattern, and fisheries management. Increased awareness about the importance of onboard decision-making can lead to improved performance. This approach could serve to document performance over time helping fishing companies to better understand the effect of their daily and more long-term decision-making on the environmental performance of their products. Fishing companies should document their resource use and production on a detailed level. Fuel use should be monitored as part of the management system. Managing authorities should ensure that sufficient data is available to evaluate the sustainability of exploitation levels of all harvested species.;"[Ziegler, Friederike; Hornborg, Sara] SP Tech Res Inst Sweden, Sustainable Food Prod Food & Biosci, POB 5401, S-40229 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Groen, Evelyne A.; Bokkers, Eddie A.

We provide a method to estimate the sensitivity of benthic habitats based on the longevity composition of the invertebrate community. We hypothesize that long-lived species are more sensitive to trawling mortality due to their lower pace of life (i.e., slower growth, late maturation). We analyze data from box-core and grab samples taken from 401 stations in the English Channel and southern North Sea to estimate the habitat-specific longevity composition of the benthic invertebrate community and of specific functional groups (i.e., suspension feeders and bioturbators), and examine how bottom trawling affects the longevity biomass composition. The longevity biomass composition differed between habitats governed by differences in sediment composition (gravel and mud content) and tidal bed-shear stress. The biomass proportion of long-lived species increased with gravel content and decreased with mud content and shear stress. Bioturbators had a higher median longevity than suspension feeders. Trawling, in particular by gears that penetrate the seabed >2 cm, shifted the community toward shorter-lived species. Changes from bottom trawling were highest in habitats with many long-lived species (hence increasing with gravel content, decreasing with mud content). Benthic communities in high shear stress habitats were less affected by bottom trawling. Using these relationships, we predicted the sensitivity of the benthic community from bottom trawling impact at large spatial scale (the North Sea). We derived different benthic sensitivity metrics that provide a basis to estimate indicators of trawling impact on a continuous scale for the total community and specific functional groups. In combination with high resolution data of trawling pressure, our approach can be used to monitor and assess trawling impact and seabed status at the scale of the region or broadscale habitat and to compare the environmental impact of bottom-contacting fishing gears across fisheries.;"[Rijnsdorp, Adriaan D.; Hintzen, Niels T.; van Kooten, Tobias] Wageningen Marine Res, POB 68, NL-1970 AB Ijmuiden, Netherlands; [Rijnsdorp, Adriaan D.] Wageningen Univ, Aquaculture & Fisheries Grp, POB 338, NL-6700 AH Wageningen, Netherlands; [Bolam, Stefan G.; Garcia, Clement] Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Pakefield Rd, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England; [Hiddink, Jan Geert] Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Gwynedd, Wales; [van Denderen, P.

We aimed to disentangle the dominance of environmental variations and trawling intensity in order to explain the distribution of diversity patterns over 152 sampling sites in the French trawl fishing-ground, the Grande Vasiere. Using a towed underwater video device, we identified 39 taxa to the finest taxonomic level possible, which were clustered according to their vulnerability to trawling disturbance based on functional traits. Using generalized linear models, we investigated whether the density distribution of each vulnerability group was sensitive to trawling intensity and habitat characteristics. Our analyses revealed a structuring effect of depth and substratum on community structure. The distribution of the more vulnerable group was a negative function of trawling intensity, while the distributions of the less vulnerable groups were independent of trawling intensity. Video monitoring coupled with trait-based vulnerability assessment of macro-epibenthic communities might be more relevant than the traditional taxonomic approach to identifying the areas that are most vulnerable to fishing activities in conservation planning.;"[Merillet, Laurene; Mouchet, Maud] UPMC, MNHN, CNRS, Ctr Ecol & Sci Conservat,UMR 7204, 43 Rue Buffon, F-75005 Paris, France; [Merillet, Laurene; Robert, Marianne; Salaun, Michele; Schuck, Lucie; Kopp, Dorothee] IFREMER, Unite Sci & Technol Halieut, Lab Technol & Biol Halieut, 8 Rue Francois Toullec, F-56100 Lorient, France; [Vaz, Sandrine] IFREMER, Lab Halieut Mediterranee, UMR MARBEC, Ave Jean Monnet, F-34200 Sete, France";;"Merillet, L (corresponding author), UPMC, MNHN, CNRS, Ctr Ecol & Sci Conservat,UMR 7204, 43 Rue Buffon, F-75005 Paris, France.; Merillet, L (corresponding author), IFREMER, Unite Sci & Technol Halieut, Lab Technol & Biol Halieut, 8 Rue Francois Toullec, F-56100 Lorient, France.";laurene.merillet@gmail.com;"Kopp, Dorothee/ABE-1546-2020; Robert, Marianne/V-6221-2018; Mouchet, Maud A/D-4145-2013";"Robert, Marianne/0000-0002-4727-5509; Mouchet, Maud A/0000-0001-5939-6802; Vaz, Sandrine/0000-0002-7365-8335; Kopp, Dorothee/0000-0002-8767-2736";France Filiere Peche;This work was part of the TETRIS project supported by France Filiere Peche.;48;11;11;0;15;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;NEW YORK;32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA;0376-8929;1469-4387;ENVIRON CONSERV;Environ.

This gear was selected since its peculiar features allow describing its evolution and uses through a very long period, contrary to other gears. Evidences of its use dates back classic authors (Oppiano) and continues till the 19th century. The gear was adopted along several areas of the Mediterranean coasts. The use of ganguy was criticized by fishermen adopting traditional gears due to concerns on its impact on exploited species and the marine environment. Accordingly, since the 14th century, its use was banned or restricted in many areas. Almost in the same period, the use of other fishing gears, in particular different typologies of oyster dredges and trawls, was banned in the Mediterranean Sea, but also in the North and Baltic Sea. Traditional coastal fishermen defended preservation of the fish fauna, respecting their biological cycles and the marine environment in general. Conflicts between the two drew government attention to protecting territorial waters from the effects of this new fishing gear on the seabed. Periodic issues of prohibitive or restrictive regulations on fishermen's practices ensued. Analysis of the effects of these regulations on fisheries, which started in the 14th century, highlights government interest in this subject. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Electrotrawling for brown shrimp Crangon crangon is increasingly used in shallow coastal zones and estuaries of the southern North Sea. As these fishing grounds are often important nurseries and spawning areas for various marine species, electrotrawling could therefore harm inhabiting fishes during their early life stages. Hence, this research aims to investigate the effect of electric pulses used to catch brown shrimp on the survival and development of Sole embryos and larvae. Exposure of Sole embryos at 2d postfertilization and larvae at 11d posthatching to pulsed DC used to catch brown shrimp did not result in a lower survival 8d after exposure. Additionally, no differences in yolk sac resorption and morphometric length measurements of the notochord, muscle, eye, and head were observed in the developing larvae.;"[Desender, Marieke; Dumolein, Lisa] Univ Ghent, Fac Vet Med, Dept Morphol, Salisburylaan 133, B-9820 Merelbeke, Belgium; [Desender, Marieke; Delbare, Daan; Polet, Hans] Inst Agr & Fisheries Res, Anim Sci Fisheries, Ankerstr 1, B-8400 Oostende, Belgium; [Desender, Marieke; Chiers, Koen; Decostere, Annemie] Univ Ghent, Fac Vet Med, Dept Pathol Bacteriol & Poultry Dis, Salisburylaan 133, B-9820 Merelbeke, Belgium; [Duchateau, Luc] Univ Ghent, Fac Vet Med, Dept Comparat Physiol & Biometr, Salisburylaan 133, B-9820 Merelbeke, Belgium; [Adriaens, Dominique] Univ Ghent, Fac Vet Med, Res Grp Evolutionary Morphol Vertebrates, Dept Biol, KL Ledeganckstr 35, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium";;"Desender, M (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Fac Vet Med, Dept Morphol, Salisburylaan 133, B-9820 Merelbeke, Belgium.; Desender, M (corresponding author), Inst Agr & Fisheries Res, Anim Sci Fisheries, Ankerstr 1, B-8400 Oostende, Belgium.; Desender, M (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Fac Vet Med, Dept Pathol Bacteriol & Poultry Dis, Salisburylaan 133, B-9820 Merelbeke, Belgium.";marieke.desender@ugent.be;Adriaens, Dominique/G-1587-2010;Adriaens, Dominique/0000-0003-3610-2773;"Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders, Belgium; European Fisheries Fund";This research received funding and support from the Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders, Belgium, and the European Fisheries Fund.

In particular, in the Mediterranean Sea, only few studies are available about bycatch and discards of elasmobranchs in artisanal coastal fisheries. In this study, we focus our attention on elasmobranch catches in a trammel net fishery targeting cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) in the southeastern Ionian coast of Sicily (central Mediterranean Sea). In 2017, during the peak S. officinalis fishing season (February-May), four species of the infraclass Batoidea (Raja radula, Dasyatis pastinaca, Torpedo marmorata and Torpedo torpedo) constituted the total elasmobranch catches of the 16 survey days. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) of T. torpedo, in both number of specimens and biomass terms, showed the highest value, accounting for about 50% of the total. Except for the three larger specimens of R. radula (1.7% of R. radula specimens caught), all elasmobranchs were discarded. An ANOVA showed significant differences (P<0.05) between monthly CPUE values of the four species; while, for each species, the chi-square test failed (P>0.05) to show a significant difference in monthly CPUE values. Average disc width of the specimens caught showed the overall presence of a large number of juveniles. Chi-square test for sex ratio showed a significant difference (P<0.05) only for T. torpedo. For D. pastinaca, survival rate was equal to 0. Local traditions play an essential role in fishermen's choice to discard or retain fishes. Monitoring the impact of fishing on populations of these vulnerable or potentially vulnerable species is of fundamental importance for the development of management strategies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The section was tested in three different configurations: without any stimulation device, with a mechanical stimulation device, and with LED light stimulation devices. We analysed and compared the behaviour of cod and haddock in all three configurations based on release results and underwater recordings. Parallel to the fishing trials, we carried out fall-through tests to determine the upper physical size limits for cod and haddock to be able to escape through the square meshes in the section. This enabled us to infer whether lack of release efficiency was due to fish behaviour or release potential of the square meshes in the section. The results showed that the escape behaviour of haddock can be triggered by mechanical stimulation. In contrast, cod did not react significantly to the presence of mechanical stimulators. LED light stimulation had some effect on the behaviour of haddock, but not on cod.;"[Grimaldo, Eduardo; Sistiaga, Manu; Herrmann, Bent] SINTEF Fisheries & Aquaculture, Brattorkaia 17C, N-7010 Trondheim, Norway; [Herrmann, Bent; Larsen, Roger B.; Brinkhof, Jesse; Tatone, Ivan] Arctic Univ Norway, UiT, N-9037 Tromso, Norway";;Grimaldo, E (corresponding author), SINTEF Fisheries & Aquaculture, Brattorkaia 17C, N-7010 Trondheim, Norway.;Eduardo.Grimaldo@sintef.no;"Grimaldo, Eduardo/M-1457-2019; Larsen, Roger B./AAY-4314-2021";"Grimaldo, Eduardo/0000-0003-2690-9477; Herrmann, Bent/0000-0003-1325-6198";"Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway [243627]; Directorate of Fisheries";We thank the crew of the R/V Helmer Hanssen for their valuable assistance on board the vessel.

We present an overview of the distribution of seabed litter and bottom trawling in Norwegian waters (the Norwegian Sea and the southern Barents Sea). Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) records and trawl marks (TM) on the seabed were used as indicators of pressure and impact of bottom trawling, respectively. Estimates of TM density and litter abundance were based on analyses of seabed videos from 1,778 locations, surveyed during 23 cruises, part of the Norwegian seabed mapping programme MAREANO. The abundance and composition of litter and the density of TM varied with depth, and type of sediments and marine landscapes. Lost or discarded fishing gear (especially lines and nets), and plastics (soft and hard plastic and rubber) were the dominant types of litter. The distribution of litter reflected the distribution of fishing intensity (density of VMS records) and density of TM at a regional scale, with highest abundance close to the coast and in areas with high fishing intensity, indicated from the VMS data. However, at a local scale patterns were less clear. An explanation to this could be that litter is transported with currents and accumulates in troughs, canyons, and local depressions, rather than reflecting the fisheries footprints directly. Also, deliberate dumping of discarded fishing gear is likely to occur away from good fishing grounds. Extreme abundance of litter, observed close to the coast is probably caused by such discarded fishing gear, but the contribution from aggregated populations on land is also indicated from the types of litter observed. The density of trawl marks is a good indicator of physical impact in soft sediments where the trawl gear leaves clear traces, whereas on harder substrates the impacts on organisms is probably greater than indicated by the hardly visible marks. The effects of litter on benthic communities is poorly known, but large litter items, such as lost fishing gear may add to the direct negative effects of bottom trawling.;"[Buhl-Mortensen, Pal; Buhl-Mortensen, Lene] Inst Marine Res, Sect Benth Communities, Bergen, Norway";;Buhl-Mortensen, P (corresponding author), Inst Marine Res, Sect Benth Communities, Bergen, Norway.;paalbu@imr.no;Buhl-Mortensen, Lene/AAP-9202-2020;"Buhl-Mortensen, Pal/0000-0003-4795-3143; Buhl-Mortensen, Lene/0000-0003-0530-7119";Norwegian annual budget as part of the funding of the MAREANO programme;This work is funded directly under the Norwegian annual budget as part of the funding of the MAREANO programme.;37;14;14;3;6;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND;;2296-7745;FRONT MAR SCI;Front.

However, impacts could vary at very small scale and the resolution of VMS data might not be fine enough. Other proxy could be used, such as trawl marks visible on the seabed observed by underwater video or side-scan sonar to evaluate small-scale trawling effort. In the Bay of Biscay, an underwater video survey of the Nephrops norvegicus fishing ground was conducted and provided environmental characteristics such as depth and number of trawl marks at 152 transects. The relevance of observed trawl marks as a small-scale proxy of trawling effort was tested depending on the sediment type. The model showed a significant positive relation between density of marks and trawling effort for all sediments together but a different relation for each sediment type. Considering each sediment type separately, the unexpected high number of marks observed on sands could be linked with cohesive interactions between calcium carbonates particles while the low number of marks on fine lithoclastic muds could be due to sediment reworking and bioturbation. We conclude that the impact of trawling on the seabed varies with the type of sediments, hydrodynamic parameters, bioturbation and trawling intensity, leading to a very complex relationship. Trawl marks observed on video footage thus could be used as a proxy of trawling effort among the same type of sediment and not for fine lithoclastic muds.;"[Merillet, Laurene; Kopp, Dorothee; Robert, Marianne; Salaun, Michele; Mehault, Sonia] IFREMER, Unite Sci & Technol Halieut, LTBH, 8 Rue Francois Toullec, F-56100 Lorient, France; [Bourillet, Jean-Francois] IFREMER, Ctr Bretagne, Dept Ressources Phys & Ecosyst Fond Mer REM, CS 10070,ZI Pointe Diable, F-29280 Plouzane, France; [Mouchet, Maud] UPMC, CNRS, MNHN, UMR 7204,Ctr Ecol & Sci Conservat CESCO, 43 Rue Buffon, F-75005 Paris, France";;Merillet, L (corresponding author), IFREMER, Unite Sci & Technol Halieut, LTBH, 8 Rue Francois Toullec, F-56100 Lorient, France.;laurene.merillet@gmail.com;"Kopp, Dorothee/ABE-1546-2020; Robert, Marianne/V-6221-2018; Mouchet, Maud A/D-4145-2013";"Robert, Marianne/0000-0002-4727-5509; Mouchet, Maud A/0000-0001-5939-6802; BOURILLET, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-6982-592X; Kopp, Dorothee/0000-0002-8767-2736";"IFREMER; France Filiere Peche";Trawl marks data were acquired during the TETRIS project funded by IFREMER and France Filiere Peche.

These OWFs will be integrated into an ecosystem already facing multiple anthropogenic disturbances. A holistic view of cumulated impacts (OWF construction, global warming and fisheries) were developed on the Courseulles-sur-Mer' ecosystem through the use of a qualitative mathematical modelling approach. This modelling approach provides the mean to consider alternative hypotheses about how the ecosystem structure and function affects its dynamics. Alternative models were constructed to address the different hypotheses regarding the behaviour of top predator (whether the top predators will be scared away by the OWF or attracted by the reef effect), impacts of global warming and changes in fisheries activities. Key findings from these analyses are that the OWF construction could lead to an increase in benthos species and fish benthos feeders whatever the perturbation scenario, while the predicted response of top predators was ambiguous across all perturbation scenario.

Previous studies in this area reported a survival rate between 30% and 51%, but the experiments were done on a limited monitoring period and the seasonal variations were not investigated. This study was designed to obtain a reliable value for survival rate after a 14-day monitoring period in onshore tanks allowing considering delayed mortality. The study also tested the effect on the survival rate of using a discarding chute system, a sorting device that was made mandatory on the 1st of January 2017 for Nephrops trawlers in the Bay of Biscay. This device, which enables fishermen to discard undersized Nephrops back to the sea while sorting, led to an increased average survival rate (51.2%) compared with the standard sorting practice (36.9%). The impact of biological, environmental and fishing operation related variables on survival from the first day of captivity to the end of the monitoring period was examined using a generalized linear model. The results of the GLM indicate that injuries, season and duration of the air exposure, significantly influence the survival from the 1st day of captivity to the end of the monitoring period. The survival rate was higher for non-injured Nephrops as well as for Nephrops that have undergone short air exposure, in summer and autumn.;"[Merillet, Laurene; Mehault, Sonia; Morandeau, Fabien; Morfin, Marie; Kopp, Dorothee] IFREMER, Unite Sci & Technol Halieut, Lab Technol & Biol Halieut, 8 Rue Francois Toullec, F-56100 Lorient, France; [Rimaud, Thomas; Piton, Corentine] Assoc Grand Littoral Atlanique, 6 Rue Alphonse Rio, F-56100 Lorient, France";;Merillet, L (corresponding author), IFREMER, Unite Sci & Technol Halieut, Lab Technol & Biol Halieut, 8 Rue Francois Toullec, F-56100 Lorient, France.;laurene.merillet@gmail.com;Kopp, Dorothee/ABE-1546-2020;Kopp, Dorothee/0000-0002-8767-2736;"French ministry of Environment, Energy and the Sea; France Filiere Peche; IFREMER; French regions Bretagne, Pays de la Loire and Nouvelle Aquitaine";This project was funded by the French ministry of Environment, Energy and the Sea, France Filiere Peche, IFREMER and the French regions Bretagne, Pays de la Loire and Nouvelle Aquitaine.

The northern central Adriatic Sea, though one of the most overfished basins of the Mediterranean Sea, supports a very valuable marine biodiversity, including elasmobranchs. This study assesses the impact of the northern central Adriatic pelagic trawl fishery on common smooth-hound (Mustelus mustelus), spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias), common eagle ray (Myliobatis aquila), and pelagic stingray (Pteroplatytrygon violacea) by examining incidental catches recorded between 2006 and 2015. The distribution of bycatch events was evaluated using geo-referenced data. Generalized Linear Models were computed to standardize the catch of the four species and to predict the relative abundance of bycatch events. Data analysis shows that most bycatch events involving all four species occurred in the northern Adriatic Sea. The models predicted significant, distinct temporal patterns of standardized catches in line with previous investigations. Water depth, season, and fishing region were the best predictors to explain bycatch events. The present data suggest that the northern Adriatic may be an important nursery area for several elasmobranchs. They also highlight the urgent need for a better understanding of the interactions between elasmobranchs and fisheries to develop and apply suitable, ad hoc management measures.;"[Bonanomi, Sara; Pulcinella, Jacopo; Moro, Fabrizio; Sala, Antonello] Italian Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Marine Sci ISMAR, Ancona, Italy; [Fortuna, Caterina Maria] Italian Natl Inst Environm Protect & Res ISPRA, Rome, Italy";;Bonanomi, S (corresponding author), Italian Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Marine Sci ISMAR, Ancona, Italy.;sara.bonanomi@an.ismar.cnr.it;"Sala, Antonello/B-8517-2016; Fortuna, Caterina Maria/J-7796-2016; Bonanomi, Sara/Q-4026-2018";"Sala, Antonello/0000-0001-7066-1152; Fortuna, Caterina Maria/0000-0003-3036-5337; Bonanomi, Sara/0000-0002-2236-9015; Pulcinella, Jacopo/0000-0003-4142-5067";"Italian Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry Policies (General Directorate for Fisheries and Aquaculture) [007525]; Italian obligations to the Council Regulation (EC) [812/2004]";"The research was supported by the Italian Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry Policies (General Directorate for Fisheries and Aquaculture, Agreement No. 007525) in compliance with the Italian obligations to the Council Regulation (EC) 812/2004.

We sampled soft-seafloor macrofauna over a precise trawling gradient in the Kattegat using hourly vessel monitoring systems and logbooks. The gradient included the establishment of a marine protected area (MPA), where trawling intensity declined sharply to zero. Our results show shifts in the macrofauna assemblage and non-linear responses, with decreases in the number and diversity of species at low to medium trawling intensities. The benthic community was dominated by burrowing brittle stars, of which one species, Amphiura chiajei, increased in abundance from low to medium trawling intensities. We interpret this positive response to increasing trawling intensities as a consequence of reduction in predation by benthivorous flatfish and Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus, which are significant catches of the fishery. The response was supported by a corresponding trend towards lower abundance of the dominating brittle stars following enforcement of the MPA and presumably an increase in benthivore density and predation pressure within the MPA. We conclude that chronic bottom trawling reduces diversity and may boost the abundances of species resistant to bottom trawling. The results emphasize the need to consider food web effects when assessing the impact of bottom trawling.;"[Skold, Mattias; Jonsson, Patrik; Nilsson, Hans C.; Bartolino, Valerio] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Inst Marine Res, Dept Aquat Resources, S-45330 Lysekil, Sweden; [Goransson, Peter] PAG Environm Res, S-25270 Raa, Sweden; [Bastardie, Francois] DTU Aqua Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, DK-2920 Charlottenlund, Denmark; [Blomqvist, Mats] Hafok AB, S-17961 Stenhamra, Sweden; [Agrenius, Stefan] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Marine Sci Kristineberg, S-45178 Fiskebackskil, Sweden; [Hiddink, Jan Geert] Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Anglesey, Wales";;Skold, M (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Inst Marine Res, Dept Aquat Resources, S-45330 Lysekil, Sweden.;mattias.skold@slu.se;Hiddink, Jan Geert/C-1238-2009;"Hiddink, Jan Geert/0000-0001-7114-830X; Bastardie, Francois/0000-0002-2669-6179";"EU project 'BENTHIS' [693, 312088]; Swedish agency for marine and water management, SwAM [Dnr 74915, 482113]; Swedish Research Council FormasSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas [2012942]; SWaM; County Administration of Halland, Sweden";We thank 4 anonymous reviewers for critical and fruitful comments on the manuscript.

In the process of designing vessels of this type, one of the main and most difficult tasks is to design the shape of the hull. For a successful solution of this task, an integrated approach is needed: aiming not only at minimization of water resistance, but also at ensuring sea-keeping performance of the vessel in the Baltic Sea. The use of mathematical tools in assessing see-keeping capacities of vessels cannot provide the necessary accuracy of calculations. The most reliable results at the early design stages can be obtained only by experiments with models of vessels in the experimental tank, provided that the scale effect should be minimal.

For these purpose, surveys were realized with 18 - 20 - 22 mm nominal bar length red mullet gillnets between December 2008 and May 2010 along the north Aegean Sea coasts (5-30 m). SELECT method was used with five different model (Normal location, normal scale, log-normal, gamma and bi-modal) for evaluating selectivity parameters of non target fish species. Selectivity models were determined as bi-modal for Serranus scriba and Symphodus tinca, log normal for Scorpaena porcus and Spicara maena and gamma for Pagellus acarne. Optimum catch lengths and spread values and selectivity curves were given for 5 species. Results showed that use of a larger mesh size over the 22 mm mesh is important for ensuring stock sustainability of the non target fish species.;"[Kocabas, Engin] Republ Turkey Minist Food Agr & Livestock, Bandirma Sheep Breeding Res Inst, Fisheries Dept, Balikesir, Turkey; [Oztekin, Alkan; Daban, Ismail Burak; Ayaz, Adnan] Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Marine Sci & Technol Fac, Fisheries & Fish Proc Dept, Canakkale, Turkey";;Daban, IB (corresponding author), Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Marine Sci & Technol Fac, Fisheries & Fish Proc Dept, Canakkale, Turkey.;burakdaban@comu.edu.tr;daban, burak/AAQ-2877-2021;oztekin, alkan/0000-0003-3914-9788;TubitakTurkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK) [106Y021];This study supported by Tubitak 106Y021 numbered Project.

The diet was studied by sex and size. A total of 40 preys were determined in the stomach of black anglerfish: 29 Teleost fish, 9 Crustaceans and 2 Cephalopods. Black anglerfish presents a large food spectrum (Shannon-Weaver index = 3.1, dominance = 0.06). The principal preys are Trachurus trachurus (IRI = 537.4) and Mullus barbatus (IRI = 308.6). The proportion of empty stomach was low (18.1%) all the year while the feeding intensity changes among seasons. Diet composition changed regarding size, small specimens fed essentially on small fish such as Gadiculus argenteus and Leuseurigobius suerii, intermediate and great specimens fed on larger fish (Trachurus trachurus, Mullus barbatus and Merluccius merluccius) and crustacean (Parapenaeus longirostris, Aristeus antennatus). By sex, the diet suggests that females feed on more shallow preys than males.

The aim of the experiment was to evaluate (i) the effectiveness of two types of pingers to reduce by catch rate of harbour porpoises, and (ii) the effects of pingers on the catches of the target fish species (Psetta maxima) and non-target fish species (Raja clavata, Suqualus acanthias and Trigla lucerna) in the turbot set gillnet fishery. A total of 246 specimens (95 P. maxima, 138 R. clavata, 8 P. phocoena, 4 S. acanthias and 1 T. lucerna) were caught during both Aquamark 100 and Aquamark 200 pingers trials. Catches of Psetta maxima and other fish species (Raja clavata, Suqualus acanthias and Trigla lucerna) were not affected by the sound of the pingers in the active nets. Catch of target P. maxima and non-target fish R. clavata were similar as were also for most caught species. 6 P. phocoena (2 in control and 3 in active nets with Aquamark 100) and 2 P. phocoena (1 in control and 1 in active nets with Aquamark 200) were caught in controls and active nets. There are no statistical differences between active and passive net catch per unit effort among the fish species and also cetaceans. As a conclusion, the acoustic signals clearly showed that these pinger types did not reduce by catch of harbour porpoise from the turbot gill net in the eastern Black Sea coasts, Turkey. The acoustic signals of both pinger types also did not affect the catch of target and non-target fish species.;"[Bilgin, Sabri] Sinop Univ, Fac Fisheries & Aquaculture, TR-57000 Sinop, Turkey; [Kose, Ozay] Recep Tayyip Erdogan Univ, Fac Fisheries & Aquaculture, TR-53000 Rize, Turkey";;Bilgin, S (corresponding author), Sinop Univ, Fac Fisheries & Aquaculture, TR-57000 Sinop, Turkey.;sbrbilgin@hotmail.com;"KOSE, Ozay/H-9124-2018; Bilgin, Sabri/V-2426-2019";"KOSE, Ozay/0000-0002-3565-160X; ";Recep Tayyip Erdogan University, Scientific Research Project [BAP 2010.103.03.2];The authors thank fishermen Sami Akmermer, Kazim Akmermer Ugur Akmermer and Ahmet Kalkavan for their help during the field studies.

It is archetypal of an ecosystem in which the effects of fisheries are most pronounced. Demersal trawling is the main fishing activity in the Gulf of Gabes. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was applied to assess the environmental performance landing 1 t of seafood with wooden demersal trawlers in the Gulf of Gabes. Impact categories included in the study were abiotic depletion potential (ADP), acidification potential (AP), eutrophication potential (EP), global warming potential (GWP), ozone depletion potential (ODP), photochemical oxidant formation potential (POFP), human toxicity potential (HTP), marine eco-toxicity potential (METP), terrestrial eco-toxicity potential (TETP), land occupation potential (LOP), and total cumulative energy demand (TCED). Demersal trawlers were classified based on their impact intensity. Results showed that 70% of the vessels had relatively low impacts. Impact intensity was proportional to the amount of fuel consumed to land 1 t of seafood. Ships that fished less had the highest impacts per ton, due to lower fishing effort and catch per unit effort. This is likely to typify vessels that target highly valuable species such as shrimp. Onboard vessel activities contributed most to different environmental impacts (AP, EP, GWP and POFP), related to the high energy use of this fishery. Several impacts (ADP, ODP, METP, LOP and TCED) were associated mainly with fuel and lubricating oil production. Therefore, improvements must focus on minimizing fuel consumption. LCA is a valuable tool for assessing howto increase environmental sustainability of demersal trawling and it can help stakeholders identify the main operational issues that require improvement.

Dolphin-inflicted damage to fishing gear and catch losses have increased along the Black Sea coast of the Turkey and many small-scale coastal fishermen have been severely affected. The bottom set Norwegian two-chamber pot was tested as alternative to deep gill net for preventing dolphin damage and catch losses for whiting (Merlangius merlangus) fisheries in the Black Sea and catch efficiency was found to be very low. In this study, underwater video analyses were made to describe the behaviour of whiting in and around bottom-set Norwegian two chamber pot to determine factors that are related to the catch efficiency. A total of successful 8 deployments were carried out between July 2016 and March 2017 within the boundaries of Rize province (south-eastern Black Sea). Pot was deployed at depths of 55-75 m and a total of 51 hours' video records were obtained by GoPro Hero 4 and Sony action cameras. Results showed that the 98% of observed whiting individuals approached the pot from upstream direction. In addition, it was observed that all of entering the pot occurred from upstream direction. Finally, pots should have a number of entrances to ensure that one of the entrances stays in line with the downstream and the entrances should not be placed in such a way they face each other for improving capture efficiency of whiting.;[Eryasar, Ahmet Raif] Recep Tayyip Erdogan Univ, Vocat Sch Tech Sci, Underwater Technol Program, Rize, Turkey;;Eryasar, AR (corresponding author), Recep Tayyip Erdogan Univ, Vocat Sch Tech Sci, Underwater Technol Program, Rize, Turkey.;raiferyasar@gmail.com;;;Recep Tayyip Erdogan University Research Project FundRecep Tayyip Erdogan University [FBA-2016-546];I would like to thank the captain and crews of the Piryoz 53 and Karadeniz Research Vessel.

The beam trawl fisheries of veined rapa whelk, Rapana venosa (Valenciennes, 1846), cause small benthic organisms to be captured and also damage the other species living on the seafloor. To solve this problem, a proper modification that minimise the by-catch should be designed and put into practice. This study aims to compare 72 mm commercial diamond-mesh codend with 72 mm square-mesh codend to reduce the benthic bycatch in this fishery. Materials and methods. Totally 15 hauls were carried out in south-eastern Black Sea Region within 10-14 August 2017. A commercial diamond-mesh and square-mesh beam trawls were towed simultaneously behind a commercial fishing vessel to compare the by-catch compositions. Paired t-test was used to compare the catch amount of two codends based on species. GLMM (Generalised Linear Mixed Models) was used to compare the length of captured veined rapa whelk, mussel, and crab species. Results. There was a 77-percentage-point reduction in the mean number of the captured individuals as by-catch in square-mesh codend when compared with commercial diamond-mesh codend and this difference was found statistically significant (P < 0.05). A total of 17 species was captured as by-catch in both codends. Comparing to diamond-mesh codend, the catch amount of the 13 by-catch species had decreased in square-mesh codend. Conclusions. In conclusion, the square-mesh codend was found successful in decreasing the by-catch amount of many benthic species except for flatfish species and large crabs. In addition to this, the veined rapa whelk amount fell by half and this means a 25-percentage-point profit decrease for fishermen.;[Eryasar, Ahmet R.] Recep Tayyip Erdogan Univ, Vocat Sch Tech Sci, Underwater Technol Program, Rize, Turkey;;Eryasar, AR (corresponding author), Recep Tayyip Erdogan Univ, Vocat Sch Tech Sci, Underwater Technol Program, Rize, Turkey.;raiferyasar@gmail.com;;;Recep Tayyip Erdogan University Research Project FundRecep Tayyip Erdogan University [FBA-2017-781];I would like to thank the captains and crews of the FV Piryoz 53.

Four commercial boats using beam trawls were chartered and catch data were recorded from a total of 87 hauls. The hauls were performed at a depth of 7.1-28.3 meters for a duration of 20-77 min and the hauling speed varied between 1.4-2.7 knots. About 28 species were identified as bycatch, on an average this amounted to 11.4% of the total number of specimens. There were identified two different groups in the bycatch (G1: 7-18 m, G2: 19-26 m) based on the depth. Although there was noticed a decline in the volume of bycatch in group G2, it was not significant between the groups (p> 0.05). According to the results of the Generalized Additive Models (GAM), the variables affecting the by-catch amount were identified as a fishing area, depth, haul duration, and the amount of captured rapa whelk (p< 0.01). In addition, a large proportion of immature individuals of striped venus clams (Chamelea gallina), blood cockles (Anadara kagoshimensis), Mediterranean mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and wedge clams (Donax trunculus) were caught as bycatch during the exploration.

The model was applied to cod (Gadus morhua) and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) in the Barents Sea and demonstrated a better or similar performance compared with a single species approach. The vertical distribution of cod and haddock was highly variable and was influenced by light level, water temperature, salinity, and depth. Temperature and sunlight were the most influential factors in this study. Increase in temperature resulted in decreasing catch and fish density in the acoustic dead zone (ADZ), while increasing sun altitude (surrogate for light level) increased the catch and fish density in the ADZ. The catch and density of haddock in the ADZ also increased at the lowest sun altitude level (shortly after midnight). Generally, the density of cod and haddock changed more rapidly in the ADZ than in the catch (from bottom to the effective fishing height) indicating the importance of modelling fish density in the ADZ. Finally, the uncorrelated variability in the annual residual variance of cod and haddock further strengthen the conclusion that species vertical distribution changes frequently and that there are probably many other unobserved environmental variables that affect them independently.;"[Ono, Kotaro] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, POB 355020, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Ono, Kotaro] Univ Oslo, CEES, Dept Biosci, POB 1066, NO-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Kotwicki, Stan] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Dingsor, Gjert E.] Inst Marine Res, Demersal Fish Res Grp, POB 1870, NO-5817 Bergen, Norway; [Johnsen, Espen] Inst Marine Res, Marine Ecosyst Acoust Res Grp, POB 1870, NO-5817 Bergen, Norway; [Dingsor, Gjert E.] Norwegian Fishing Vessel Owners Assoc, Slottsgaten 3, NO-5003 Bergen, Norway";;"Ono, K (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, POB 355020, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.; Ono, K (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, CEES, Dept Biosci, POB 1066, NO-0316 Oslo, Norway.";kotaro.ono@ibv.uio.no;Kotwicki, Stan/C-3599-2009;"Kotwicki, Stan/0000-0002-6112-5021; ono, kotaro/0000-0003-4236-5916";"Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean (JISAO) under NOAA [NA15OAR4320063, 2017-076]; Research Council of Norway through the SkagCore projectResearch Council of Norway; NOAA International Science program; IMR Strategic project Reduced Uncertainty in Stock Assessment (REDUS)";Kotaro Ono was partially funded by the Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean (JISAO) under NOAA Cooperative Agreement NA15OAR4320063, Contribution No. 2017-076 and the Research Council of Norway through the SkagCore project.

When discarding no longer is an option, leasing quota or changing fishing practices remain important tools to avoid choke species. Here, the scale and tactics linked to using avoidance behaviour to reduce choke species is investigated by analysing the fishing behaviour of a single demersal trawler in the North Sea. Analysis combined qualitative information collected from through interviews with the vessel owner and skipper, along with quantitative analysis on fisheries data. From the interviews, saithe and cod were identified as potential choke species and subsequent analysis focused on these two species. The analysis of catch and quota composition showed that cod would choke the fishery early if no catch-quota balancing options were available, resulting in a 87% reduction in revenue, while saithe could choke the fishery later, resulting in a 43% reduction in revenue. Avoidance behaviour was difficult to detect from fisheries data, which was explained by avoidance taking primarily place through very fine-scale tactical choices rather than large displacements. Catch composition showed that saithe is distributed more patchily than cod, with most hauls containing small amounts of saithe and a few hauls containing large amounts. In conclusion this paper supplies an view on the choke species problem seen from the perspective of an individual fisher and highlights the amount of real-time tactical decisions and trade-offs that need to be made when operating in mixed-fisheries.;"[Mortensen, Lars O.; Ulrich, Clara] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, Lyngby, Denmark; [Hansen, Jan; Hald, Rasmus] KARBAK Aps, Thisted, Denmark";;Mortensen, LO (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, Lyngby, Denmark.;laomo@aqua.dtu.dk;Ulrich, Clara/F-3583-2011;Ulrich, Clara/0000-0001-7598-2051;"European Union' [289257, 633680]; Ministry of Environment and Food of Denmark, under the European Fisheries Fund";The collaboration with the skipper and the owner of the vessel Karbak (HM635) took place as part of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7 /2007-2013) under grant agreement MYFISH no 289257 (www.myfishproject.eu).

Among species presenting an elevated survival potential, plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) is one of the most discarded in the coastal otter trawl fishery in the English Channel. The objective of this study is to provide the most reliable estimates of plaice survival after release in commercial conditions, and to identify the factors that influence survival rates. A captivity experiment was conducted in January February in the English fishery to assess the survival of discarded plaice as a function of a semi-quantitative index of fish vitality, which has been demonstrated to be a good proxy of fish survival in comparable fishing and environmental conditions. This study examined the potential of this index to estimate discard survival in three trials from the English and French fisheries and at three different seasons. The vitality index was then used to analyse the influence of several factors (fishing practices, environmental conditions and fish biological characteristics) on the discard survival. The survival rates for plaice were accurately estimated at 62.8% in January February, 66.6% in November and 45.2% in July. While these rates remained substantial whatever the fishing, environmental or fish biological conditions, the time fish spent on the deck, the bottom and air temperatures, the tow depth and the fish length had a significant influence on plaice survival. In practice, plaice survival could be enhanced by releasing the fish early during catch sorting and avoiding exposure to extreme air temperatures. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Length and sex of fish and presence or absence of the parasite were recorded. The prevalence by Spraguea was used to analyse the infection level. The role of each variable (fish length, fish sex, geographical area and year) and the interactions among them on the Spraguea prevalence were analyzed by using a binomial GLM. Area and fish length had a more relevant effect on the infestation of both anglerfish, while the impact of the year and fish sex was less evident. The Spraguea prevalence by area ranged between 11% and 52% in L. budegassa and between 39% and 66% in L. piscatorius. This is the first study in which the prevalence of this parasite in L. budegassa is analyzed in several areas and inter-annually compared.

Fixed nets are a matter of concern for sea turtles mainly in coastal areas during the neritic stage when both juvenile and adult life stages are affected. Mortality caused by entanglement in set nets is related to forced apnoea due to the high soak time of the nets and consequent drowning. This study investigated the loggerhead turtle bycatch in set net coastal fisheries in the northern Adriatic Sea (General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean Geographical Sub-Area 17, [GSA 17]) through an interview-based approach, to understand the potential contribution of these fisheries to the general decline of the sea turtle population. A second goal was to identify a possible hot-spot turtle bycatch area through on-board observations. The study estimates that more than 5400 turtles are caught in the west GSA 17 each year with the largest number in the summer. A hot-spot for entanglement was also identified in an area located south of the River Po delta (41.5-69m depth) during the summer. Sixty-four turtles were caught over a period of 30 fishing days by either trammel nets and gillnets (0.7 and 0.5 turtle per km of net respectively) and was the greatest number that has been observed anywhere in the Mediterranean. Possible management strategies to reduce bycatch include technical modification to gear setting (such as reducing netting slack and using small meshes), bycatch reducer devices (such as LED UV), and area and seasonal gear restrictions to small-scale fisheries in areas of greatest concern in the northern Adriatic Sea.;"[Lucchetti, Alessandro; Vasapollo, Claudio; Virgili, Massimo] Inst Marine Sci ISMAR Ancona Italy, Natl Res Council CNR, Largo Fiera Pesca 1, I-60125 Ancona, Italy";;Lucchetti, A (corresponding author), Inst Marine Sci ISMAR Ancona Italy, Natl Res Council CNR, Largo Fiera Pesca 1, I-60125 Ancona, Italy.;a.lucchetti@ismar.cnr.it;"Vasapollo, Claudio/A-4456-2014; Virgili, Massimo/Q-4506-2018; Lucchetti, Alessandro/AAV-7188-2020";"Vasapollo, Claudio/0000-0002-5381-6690; Lucchetti, Alessandro/0000-0001-8418-9848";TartaLife Project [LIFE12 NAT/IT/000937];TartaLife Project, Grant/Award Number: LIFE12 NAT/IT/000937;72;10;10;6;26;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1052-7613;1099-0755;AQUAT CONSERV;Aquat.

This means that conventional selectivity or survival studies may ignore the selectivity of net parts other than the codend for certain species. By attaching 12 small meshed collecting bags to different parts of a Danish anchor seine net and conducting normal commercial fishing activities, this study showed that there is a substantial escapement of fish and (especially) invertebrates from the forward parts of the seine net. For seven species of demersal fish, most fish escaped through the lower panel close to the codend. All invertebrate species were found in higher numbers in the collecting bags than in the codend where many organisms escaped in the lower panel of the wings or the belly. Mean levels of visible damage ranged from 1.00 to 3.25 for collected invertebrates and were similar for all gear parts.

Thorough research is required in order to understand fishers' perceptions and to achieve effective implementation of the regulation, as it is possible that certain implications might arise within the fishing industry and the associated communities after the shift to the new management regime. In this paper, fishers' socio-economic behaviour is analyzed in relation to discarding practices under the discrete choice framework. Specifically, a variety of socioeconomic attributes, in the form of principal components that may affect the choices of the Greek bottom trawl fishers on three key discards' drivers are analyzed to identify possible links between these. Utilizing the same attributes, eight hypothetical management tools that can be adopted for a smoother implementation of the discard ban are examined and the main results are discussed afterwards. Consistent patterns were revealed regarding fishers' behaviour. An association of vessels' efficiency with the probability to discard due to market limitations was evident, along with the association of different socioeconomic factors, such as the fishers' age and the vessel's crew size, with the incentives proposed regarding the introduction of awareness seminars. It is important to study these patterns carefully to understand the drivers and fishers' motivation towards discarding. Their preferences on management tools that can be adopted by the EU member will also be considered, which can lead to a successful introduction of the regulation and a meaningful contribution into an effective management framework within which stakeholders can behave sustainably.;"[Christou, Maria; Stergiou, Konstantinos I.] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Biol, Dept Zool, Lab Ichthyol, POB 134, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece; [Christou, Maria; Haralabous, John; Stergiou, Konstantinos I.; Damalas, Dimitrios; Maravelias, Christos D.] Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Marine Biol Resources & Inland Waters, 46-7km Athens Sounio,POB 712, Anavissos 19013, Attica, Greece";;Christou, M (corresponding author), Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Marine Biol Resources & Inland Waters, 46-7km Athens Sounio,POB 712, Anavissos 19013, Attica, Greece.;mchristou@hcmr.gr;Maravelias, Christos/W-4151-2019;"Maravelias, Christos/0000-0002-2440-3707; Christou, Maria/0000-0003-1048-8823";European Commission's Horizon Research and Innovation Programme [634495];This research has received funding from the European Commission's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under Grant Agreement No. 634495 for the project Science, Technology, and Society Initiative to minimize Unwanted Catches in European Fisheries (MINOUW).

The present study compares outputs of a process-driven benthic habitat sensitivity (PDS) model to the structure, composition and distribution of benthic invertebrates in the Eastern English Channel and southern part of the North Sea. Trawl disturbance indicators (TDI) computed from species biological traits and benthic community composition were produced from samples collected with a bottom trawl. The TDI was found to be highly correlated to the PDS further validating the latter's purpose to identify natural process-driven pattern of sensitivity. PDS was found to reflect an environmental potential that may no longer be fully observable in the field and difference with in situ biological observations could be partially explained by the spatial distribution of fishery pressure on the seafloor. The management implication of these findings are discussed and we suggest that, used in conjunction with TDI approaches, PDS may help monitor management effort by evaluating the difference between the current state and the presumed optimal environmental status of marine benthic habitats.;"[Foveau, Aurelie; Desroy, Nicolas] IFREMER, Lab Environm & Ressources Bretagne Nord, Dinard, France; [Vaz, Sandrine] IFREMER, UMR MARBEC, Sete, France; [Kostylev, Vladimir E.] Nat Resources Canada, Geol Survey Canada Atlantic, Dartmouth, NS, Canada";;Foveau, A (corresponding author), IFREMER, Lab Environm & Ressources Bretagne Nord, Dinard, France.;aurelie.foveau@ifremer.fr;;"Foveau, Aurelie/0000-0001-6283-2214; Vaz, Sandrine/0000-0002-7365-8335; Nicolas, Desroy/0000-0002-9047-5637";"INTERREG IV A project CHARM III (CHannel integrated Approach for marine Resource Management); French research agency (ANR), through project COMANCHE (Ecosystem interactions and anthropogenic impacts on great scallop populations in the English Channel)French National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-2010-STRA-010]; European Union under INTERREG IVA CHARM III project (Channel integrated Approach for marine Resource Management)";"This study was partly supported by the INTERREG IV A project CHARM III (CHannel integrated Approach for marine Resource Management), the French research agency (ANR), through the project COMANCHE (Ecosystem interactions and anthropogenic impacts on great scallop populations in the English Channel) - ANR-2010-STRA-010.; The authors are grateful to all the scientists who brought help for the research of environmental layers, the projects leaders of CGFS, IBTS and CAMANOC scientific surveys, the scientific staff and vessel crews who participated to these surveys.

The experimental trawl with a grid significantly reduces bycatch of summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) (76.4%, p<.001), black sea bass (Centropristis striata) (71.7%, p=.001), smooth dogfish (Mustelus canis) (86.0%, p<.001), and total bycatch (69.2%, p<.001) when compared to a conventional trawl. The catch rate of scup (Stenotomus chrysops) is 40.2% less than in the experimental trawl, but this difference is not statistically significant (p=.258). However, the experimental trawl also reduces targeted squid capture by 47.5% (p<.001), which is commercially unacceptable. Length analysis indicates no size effect on the retention for squid between the trawl with a grid (experimental) and the one without a grid (control), but the experimental trawl significantly reduces larger scup (>27cm FL) and larger black sea bass (>37cm TL), and all summer flounder size-classes. Therefore, this grid design may not be a suitable bycatch reduction device for the Nantucket Sound squid trawl fishery, and further work is needed to understand squid behavior within a trawl to develop a successful bycatch reduction strategy for the New England longfin inshore squid fishery.;"[Bayse, S.

Red algae beds predominate in both areas, but one has been exploited by trawling since at least 90 years ago, whereas the presence of natural barriers prevents this fishing activity in the other one. Comparisons between the two areas showed a biomass reduction of 46.8 and 39.3% of dominant red algae taxonomic groups Peyssonneliaceae and Corallinophycidae, respectively, in the trawled area (TA). Similarly, both mean abundance and biomass of most groups of fauna were higher in the not trawled area (NTA). N90 biodiversity index showed higher mean values of algae species in NTA than in TA (7.0 and 4.9, respectively), whereas no differences were detected neither for sessile nor for mobile fauna. SIMPER analysis showed that large species of both sessile and mobile epibenthic fauna (e. g. the ascidia Polycarpa mamillaris and the echinoderm Spatangus purpureus, respectively) presented higher abundance and contribution to within area similarity in NTA than in TA. In coincidence, these are the most abundant epibenthic species in the commercial hauls from the Pesquera Rica. The relatively low fishing effort and the gears used, addressed to avoid large catches of algae allowing longer hauls, may explain the subsistence of red algae beds in the Balearic Islands trawl fishing grounds. However, the detrimental effects shown here claim for urgent management measures aiming to preserve these beds. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B. V.

Sandeel presence was negatively correlated with flatfish and shrimp fisheries - both Ammodytes species with flatfish fisheries and H. lanceolatus with shrimp fisheries. Water velocity and silt content were correlated as hypothesized with the presence of all species, and sand content was positively correlated with both Ammodytes species.

The analysis of three experiments showed that innovative technical and regulation measures can lead to benefits such as the reduction of fishing effort, the improvement of the cost-benefit relation and the reduction of the direct impact on the seabed and the indirect effect on the ecosystems through reduce discards and the emission of CO2 into the atmosphere.

On-board sampling was conducted on the southwestern coasts of the Black Sea in the fishing ports of Rumelifeneri and Igneada for a total of 66 hauls on two commercial bottom trawlers from October 2012 to April 2013 and from October 2013 to April 2014. A total of 32 species were captured, including 25 species of fish, three crustacea, two echinodermata and two mollusca. Mullus barbatus and Merlangius merlangus euxinus were the target species, whereas 24 species were always discarded. Scophthalmus maximus and Pomatomus saltatrix were always retained. The two regions were similar in terms of catch and discard compositions, CPUE, DPUE and discard ratio. Discarding is important in the Black Sea commercial bottom trawl fishery and accounts for as much as 31.4% of the total bottom trawl catch. The results showed that the discard rates varied among species, depths (p=.04) and seasons (p=.0001). Finally, it was concluded that in the western Black Sea, when the impacts of depth and season are considered, that the discard quantity can be reduced.;"[Yildiz, T.; Karakulak, F.

Thus trawling may both negatively and positively influence the quantity and quality of food available. Using delta C-13 and delta N-15 we investigated potential diet changes of three commercially exploited species across trawling gradients in the Kattegat (plaice, dab and Norway lobster (Nephrops)) and the Irish Sea (Nephrops). In the Kattegat, trawling affected primarily the biomass of benthic consumers, lowering competition. Nephrops showed significant positive relationships for delta C-13 and a domed relationship for delta N-15 with trawling. In the Irish Sea, intense trawling had a negative effect on benthic prey. delta C-13 and delta N-15 thus showed the inverse relationships to those observed in the Kattegat.

This study presents the first discard survival estimates on-board Dutch commercial pulse trawlers. During seven, six, and one fishing trip(s), respectively, undersized plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), sole (Solea solea), and dab (Limanda limanda) were collected, assessed for vitality and subsequently monitored up to 21 days. Uncorrected for any potential impacts from predation, tagging, research-related handling, or holding conditions overall survival for plaice (n = 349), sole (n = 226), and dab (n = 187) was assessed as 15% [95% CI: 11-19%], 29% [95% CI: 24-35%], and 16% [95% CI: 10-26%] respectively. Survival was mainly effected by water temperature and factors linked to the fishing vessel. Fish length was not found to affect survival. Catch processing time and haul duration affected plaice survival but not sole. Vitality index, which averages reflex impairment and external damage scores, correlated with survival and may be developed as a proxy for discard survival. Compared to tickler-chain beam trawlers, pulse trawlers showed relatively higher discard survival under fishing conditions pertinent to these studies.;"[van der Reijden, K.

Complementary trophic web modelling tools were applied to the Machu ecosystem to analyse the effects of dumping operations. Results show that, after the dumping operations, the biomass of fish increased while invertebrate biomass remained relatively stable through time. Nevertheless, the biomasses of benthic invertebrates, omnivores/scavengers and predators showed some increases, while non-selective deposit feeders and filter feeders decreased. At the ecosystem level, results show that the total ecosystem activity, the ascendency and the overall omnivorous character of the food-web structure increased after dumping operations, whereas recycling subsequently decreased. Finally, the fine and medium sand habitat offshore from the Seine estuary, which undergoes regular natural physical perturbations, shows a high resilience after a short dumping phase.

Despite the need to better quantify fishing effects on some target species and on many non-target species taken as bycatch, there are few gear efficiency estimates for some of the most widely deployed towed fishing gears in the northeast Atlantic. Here, we develop a method that applies generalised additive models to catch-at-length data from trawl surveys and a commercial catch and discard monitoring program in the North Sea to estimate catch-ratios. We then rescale these catch-ratios and fit relationships to estimate gear efficiency. When catches of individuals by species were too low to enable species-specific estimates, gear efficiency was estimated for species-groups. Gear efficiency (and associated uncertainty) at length was ultimately estimated for 75 species, seven species-groups and for up to six types of trawl gear per species or species-group. Results are illustrated for dab (Limanda limanda), grey gurnard (Eutrigula gurnardus) and thornback ray (Raja clavata), two common non-target species and a depleted elasmobranch.

Fifty sea cucumbers (92.81 +/- 2.29 g) were placed into each research station and growth performances like specific growth rate (SGR) and weight gain were observed for 90 days. SGR of sea cucumbers in stations A, B and K were 0.3 +/- 0.04, 0.22 +/- 0.02 and 0.10 +/- 0.01 %/d, respectively. The highest mean weight gain 31.11 +/- 0.84 g was recorded at station A where the lowest was in station K as 8.89 +/- 0.12 g. Organic carbon and organic material amount of research stations significantly affected the final mean weights of sea cucumbers where the highest growth was determined at the stations A and B.

However, there are many candidate indicators that are considered to be robust to survey artifacts and sensitive to manageable impacts. Using extensive survey data on demersal fish assemblages around the Balearic Islands (western Mediterranean) we analyze relationships among 'traditional', taxonomic and functional diversity indices, to identify a minimum set of indices that provide a good representation of the different aspects of diversity. Secondly we model the responses of the demersal fish community diversity to bottom trawl fishing pressure. To do so, we used two different approaches: (i) considering fishing effort and depth as continuous explanatory variables; and (ii) grouping samples according to bathymetric sampling strata and contrasting levels of fishing effort. The results show that diversity can be described using different complementary aspects such as species richness, evenness, and the taxonomic and functional breadth of the species present in a given community, displaying different responses to fishing pressure. However, the changes in diversity in response to fishing may only be detectable in those communities where the levels of fishing pressure have remained relatively low. When communities have been exposed to high levels of fishing pressure for a long period, the relevant changes in diversity may have happened long before the onset of monitoring of the fishery, and hence it may be too late to detect differences between levels of fishing effort. This seems to be the case on the middle slope of the Balearic Islands, where vulnerable species have disappeared or are very infrequent, and have been replaced by species better-adapted to fishing impacts.";"[Teresa Farriols, M.; Ordines, Francesc; Pasqual, Catalina; Hidalgo, Manuel; Guijarro, Beatriz; Massuti, Enric] Inst Espanol Oceanog, Ctr Oceanog Balears, Moll de Ponent S-N, Palma De Mallorca 07015, Spain; [Somerfield, Paul J.] Plymouth Marine Lab, Prospect Pl, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England";;Farriols, MT (corresponding author), Inst Espanol Oceanog, Ctr Oceanog Balears, Moll de Ponent S-N, Palma De Mallorca 07015, Spain.;mt.farriols@ba.ieo.es;"Massuti, Enric/AAG-5117-2021; Guijarro, Beatriz/I-2480-2015; Ordinas, Francesc/AAG-7079-2021; Somerfield, Paul J/J-9189-2014; Hidalgo, Manuel/B-8023-2015";"Guijarro, Beatriz/0000-0002-2083-4681; Somerfield, Paul J/0000-0002-7581-5621; Hidalgo, Manuel/0000-0002-3494-9658; Ordines, F.

Recent studies have shown how bottom trawling can drive seascape reshaping at large spatial scales and enhance sediment transport in submarine canyons, which subsequently impacts deep-sea ecosystems. Present knowledge on the transfer and accumulation of sediment flows triggered by bottom trawling is based on localized and infrequent measurements whilst a more complete picture of the process is needed. The present work focuses on the modeling of sediment transport and accumulation resulting from trawling activities in La Fonera submarine canyon, northwestern Mediterranean Sea, thus contributing to an improved assessment of trawling impacts. Based on mooring data within a canyon gully, we use an inverse model to retrieve the unknown time series of resuspension due to trawling over the fishing grounds. This resuspension is later used as forcing for the direct problem: we simulate trawling-induced flows through the canyon and provide a 3D visualization of potential trawling impacts on sediment dynamics, including the identification of the propagation patterns of sediments resuspended by trawling. Flows coming from shallower fishing grounds are funneled through canyon flank gullies towards the canyon axis, with part of the resuspended sediment reaching the continental rise out of the canyon across the open continental slope. Trawling-induced sediment flows promote sediment accumulation beyond the canyon mouth. Given the wide geographical distribution of bottom trawling, our results have far-reaching implications that go much beyond La Fonera submarine canyon.

Here we assess the spatial and temporal variability in abundance, diversity and community structure of the suprabenthic peracarid assemblages in this region and examine this variability in relation to the natural and anthropogenic (trawling fisheries) disturbance regimes. The sampling was conducted between March 2003 and May 2004 in three main fishing grounds, the canyon head (average depth: 490 m), the canyon wall (average depth: 550 m) and the eastern adjacent slope (average depth: 820 m), as well as in two non-exploited areas in the western (at 900 m depth) and eastern (at 1500 m depth) slope near the canyon mouth. A total of 138 species were identified, with amphipods being the most speciose and abundant group, followed by mysids in terms of abundance. Our results show high spatial and temporal variability in suprabenthic assemblages. Densities were higher in the canyon head and western slope, which appear to be the preferential routes for water masses and particle fluxes in months of flood events, and other energetic processes. In the canyon head, where periodic erosion processes are more active, low diversity, high dominance and higher turnover (beta-diversity) were observed, apparently coupled with significant temporal fluctuations in the densities of the highly motile component of suprabenthos (mysids, predatory and scavenging amphipods). In the sedimentary more stable eastern slope, high diversity values were observed, accompanied by a higher relative contribution of the less motile groups (i.e. amphipods, most isopods, cumaceans). These groups have a closer interaction with the sediment where they exploit different food sources and are more susceptible to physical disturbance. Temporal variability in their diversity may be related to changes in food quality rather than quantity. In the canyon wall, temporal fluctuations in diversity indices were only revealed in relation to the overall higher and more continued fishing pressure observed in the canyon wall fishing ground (Cara Norte/Sot site). Here, species richness and abundance declined with increasing fishing pressure but the lowest trophic and taxonomic diversities were observed under intermediate levels of disturbance. These findings underline (i) the differences between relatively low and highly motile taxa in terms of response to disturbance events; (ii) the differences between assemblages subjected to different levels of natural disturbance and trawling pressure, which modify the common bathymetric patterns of abundance and diversity often described from continental margins.

Pot fishing has lower environmental impact and fuel consumption than most other fishing methods. However, pots typically have low capture efficiency for most ground-fish species, and efforts to develop effective commercial pots are needed. Bycatch of red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) is a severe problem in the coastal fishery for cod (Gadus morhua) in the Barents Sea. In a previous publication, we demonstrated that cod pots floated off the bottom eliminated this problem. Our original bottom-set cod pot has two entrances in order to increase the rate of entry of fish, but when this pot is floated, fish that search for food by following chemical cues up-current will only encounter the entrance that is oriented dbWn-current. We therefore compared the catch rates of floated pots with one and two entrances, and predicted that the new design with only one entrance would achieve higher catch rates due to a lower rate of escape. Pots with one entrance caught significantly more cod and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) than pots with two entrances. The catch rate of cod above minimum landing size (>44 cm) of pots with one entrance was 82% higher than that of pots with two entrances. Pots that were snagged and did not float properly caught large numbers of king crab. The larger catches of pots with one entrance could be explained by lower escape rate from this design. The observed difference in catch rates between the two pot types indicates that more than 50% of the large cod and haddock that entered the pot with two entrances escaped. There is therefore great potential for increased catching efficiency of pots through improved pot design. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A large proportion of the catch (ca. 42% weight) is discarded, mainly wedge clam undersized individuals and non-commercial molluscs, decapods and echinoderms. Total discards within the study period showed a high species richness, with a total of 84 taxa discarded, and biomasses ranging from 337.1 to 8532.5 g haul(-1) (1579.9 +/- 157.9 g haul(-1), mean +/- SE), with maxima in spring. The composition, structure and biomass of discards displayed significant differences among study sites due to differences in the benthic communities of the fishing grounds. Individuals displaying intermediate (intermediate survival chance) and severe (low survival chance) damage in the discard displayed higher values when gravel and bioclastic material was more abundant in the catch. Overall, 15% of the discarded individuals displayed any type of damage, from which 12% were severely damaged, and with Echinoderms displaying the highest mean proportion of damaged individuals (79.5 +/- 2.9% of individuals). The target species displayed a high proportion of undamaged individuals to fishing impacts, which may represent an important factor for the maintenance of populations of this commercial species on the fishing grounds.

The extent and intensity of bottom trawling on the European continental shelf (0-1000 m) was analysed from logbook statistics and vessel monitoring system data for 2010-2012 at a grid cell resolution of 1 x 1 min longitude and latitude. Trawling intensity profiles with seabed impact at the surface and subsurface level are presented for 14 management areas in the North-east Atlantic, Baltic Sea and Mediterranean Sea. The footprint of the management areas ranged between 53-99% and 6-94% for the depth zone from 0 to 200 m (Shallow) and from 201 to 1000 m (Deep), respectively. The footprint was estimated as the total area of all grid cells that were trawled fully or partially. Excluding the untrawled proportions reduced the footprint estimates to 28-85% and 2-77%. Largest footprints per unit landings were observed off Portugal and in the Mediterranean Sea. Mean trawling intensity ranged between 0.5 and 8.5 times per year, but was less in the Deep zone with a maximum intensity of 6.4. Highest intensities were recorded in the Skagerrak-Kattegat, Iberian Portuguese area, Tyrrhenian Sea and Adriatic Sea. Bottom trawling was highly aggregated. For the Shallow zone the seabed area where 90% of the effort occurred comprised between 17% and 63% (median 36%) of the management area. Footprints were high over a broad range of soft sediment habitats. Using the longevity distribution of the untrawled infaunal community, the seabed integrity was estimated as the proportion of the biomass of benthic taxa where the trawling interval at the subsurface level exceeds their life span. Seabed integrity was low (< 0.1) in large parts of the European continental shelfs, although smaller pockets of seabed with higher integrity values occur. The methods developed here integrate official fishing effort statistics and industry-based gear information to provide high-resolution pressure maps and indicators, which greatly improve the basis for assessing and managing benthic pressure from bottom trawling. Further they provide quantitative estimates of trawling impact on a continuous scale by which managers can steer.;"[Eigaard, Ole R.; Bastardie, Francois; Dinesen, Grete E.; Egekvist, Josefine; Geitner, Kerstin; Nielsen, J.

Based on experimental fishing conducted in 2014 and 2015, we quantified the escape rate of cod beneath the fishing line of the trawl for each of the two ground gears and thereby obtained a measure for the ground gears' catching efficiency. Fish escapees were collected in a retainer bag attached to the fishing line of the trawl and behind the ground gear, and its catches were compared with those in the trawl codend. A significant improvement in the catch efficiency was found for the SCSG relative to the rockhopper gear for cod between 56 and 105 cm, as significantly fewer cod escaped under the trawl equipped with the new ground gear. The results demonstrated that ground gear efficiency was length dependent for both ground gear types, as both showed increasing efficiency with increased fish length. The average catch efficiency for cod above 56 cm increased 9.19%-22.4% (depending on the herding efficiency) with the SCSG compared to the rock hopper, which corresponds to a reduction in the escape rate of 57.1%-61.73% (depending on the herding efficiency). This study demonstrates that improved catch efficiency can be obtained by substituting the conventional rockhopper gear with the newly developed SCSG without increasing trawl dimensions.

However, scientific documentation of the selectivity characteristics of Danish seines is lacking, and the gear generally is grouped with bottom trawls and Scottish seines in fisheries management legislation. In this study, we developed a codend cover to estimate the selectivity of a standard commercial Danish seine codend for four fish species. The data for the dominant species, dab (Limanda limanda) and plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), was best described by models that combine two or three logistic models, which indicated that more than one selection process was at work. Selectivity of cod (Gadus morhua) was best described by a Richard curve and selectivity of red gurnard (Chelidonichthys lucernus) by a logistic curve. The estimated selectivity curve of dab indicated, contrary to cod and plaice, low retention of individuals below MLS. Confidence limits for larger length classes of cod and red gurnard were relatively wide. For plaice, the estimated selection factor, which is the length with 50% retention divided by mesh size, was comparable to literature values from trawl studies. The average value for cod was similar for Danish and Scottish seines, but lower for trawls. The results are discussed in the context of fisheries management with focus on the landing obligation of the new Common Fisheries Policy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The fleet records historically high levels of discard despite numerous gear selectivity studies. Together with high discards survival, new technological solutions to minimize catches of undersized individuals could justify local exemptions from the discard ban. Our study focuses on the effects of two selective devices, a square mesh cylinder (SMC) and a grid, on the escapement of undersized individuals and discard reduction. Relative catch probability of the modified gear compared with the traditional gear was modelled using the catch comparison method. Potential losses from the commercial fraction of the catch were taken into account to assess their influence on the economic viability of fishing with the modified gears. The two devices had similar effects on undersized Nephrops escapement and on discard reduction, with median values of 26.5% and 23.6% for the SMC and of 30.4% and 21.4% for the grid, respectively. Only the grid was efficient for undersized hake, recording median values of escapement and discard reduction equal to 25.0% and 20.6%, respectively. Some loss from the commercial fraction of the catch was to be expected with both devices, which could be compensated for in the long term by the contribution of undersized individuals to the stock biomass. Our results support the use of selective gears technology as part of an integrated framework including control and management measures to mitigate the effect of the discard ban both for fishers and for the ecosystem. Further work is needed to quantify the effect of additional escapement from the gear on stock dynamics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to its inshore spawning aggregations and male nest guarding behaviors, it is considered vulnerable to over-exploitation via recreational angling. Accordingly, greater uptake of the practice of catch-and-release (C&R) may provide some potential to limit the effects of angling on populations. Thus, the consequences of C&R for 40 S. cantharus (mean length 306610 mm) were assessed. Fish were sampled following their capture from charter boats by recreational anglers with varying levels of skill and experience. Of these fish, 17% were deeply hooked (e.g. in esophagus) and considered at high risk of post-release mortality (PRM). Blood lactate levels ranged between 0.40 and 2.60 mmol l(-1) (mean +/- SE: 1.25 +/- 0.09) and were significantly and positively correlated with fight time. Reflex impairments were observed in 32% of the catch, also suggesting an elevated probability of PRM. Hook damage was the only significant predictor of reflex impairment. The dominance of males (89%) across the catches highlighted the potential for additional indirect impacts of angling via the predation of eggs by conspecifics in the vacated nests of captured males. These results are discussed within the context of post-release performance of individual S. cantharus, the potential for C&R to limit impact at the population level and a need to consider future regulation of the fishery to ensure sustainability of stocks.;"[Pinder, Adrian C.; Britton, J.

This study estimated the size-and species-selective performance of the Nordmore grid in the configuration most often applied by fishermen and made a preliminary exploration of the effects of reducing the length of the guiding funnel in front of the grid and mounting light-emitting diodes (LEDs) around the escape exit. Experimental fishing trials were conducted in the Barents Sea to assess the size-selective properties of a 19-mm bar spacing Nordmore grid, mandatory in this Norwegian trawl fishery targeting deepwater shrimp Pandalus borealis (also known as northern shrimp), and its potential improvement. Results were obtained for the target species and four bycatch species: redfish Sebastes spp., Haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus, Atlantic Cod Gadus morhua, and American Plaice Hippoglossoides platessoides. In general, very few deepwater shrimp were found to escape through the escape exit, although the quantity increased slightly at larger sizes. Between 80% and 100% of the bycatch species up to a species-specific size passed through the grid and entered the cod end. A short guiding funnel decreased this for Haddock significantly by increasing the fraction of small Haddock seeking the escape exit. Further, adding LEDs around the escape exit significantly negated this effect. For the other bycatch species, the results indicated similar trends but were not statistically significant. However, considering that only a few fishing hauls were conducted using the short guiding funnel with or without mounting LEDs calls for some caution when attributing these changes to the configuration of the Nordmore grid, and these preliminary results should be followed up by further testing before definitive conclusions are made.;"[Larsen, Roger B.; Herrmann, Bent; Brinkhof, Jesse; Tatone, Ivan] Arctic Univ Norway, UiT, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Herrmann, Bent; Sistiaga, Manu] SINTEF Fisheries & Aquaculture, Brattorkaia 17C, N-7010 Trondheim, Norway; [Langard, Lise] Norwegian Directorate Fisheries, Postbox 185 Sentrum, N-5804 Bergen, Norway";;Larsen, RB (corresponding author), Arctic Univ Norway, UiT, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.;roger.larsen@uit.no;Larsen, Roger B./AAY-4314-2021;Herrmann, Bent/0000-0003-1325-6198;"Arctic University in Tromso; Norwegian Seafood Research Fund";We thank the crew of RV Helmer Hanssen and assistants Ingeborg Saetra, Hermann Pettersen, Tomas Araya, and postdoctoral student Andre Frainer for valuable assistance on board.

The trend of these indicators over the last decade highlights a poor economic performance that is associated with an overall poor condition of the state of resources. The trend of economic performance indicators is put in relation, on a time-based approach, with the different types of management measures applied over the last decade. We show that trends of fishing effort and economic indicators as well as statistical analysis return a coherent interpretation of the main factors affecting the profitability levels of the selected fleets. The study reveals that management measures impacted negatively on the profitability of the sector in the short run. However, economic indicators inverted the trend in the last 3 years. An increasing biomass trend as well as the improvement in fishing mortality of some few stocks, together with the reduction of input costs could be considered as positive drivers which impacted positively on economic profitability of the fisheries concerned. The study argues that even the technical and fishery management provisions in the Mediterranean Sea may have started to reverse the trend in economic profitability of the analyzed fleets. An additional management effort needs, however, to be developed on an urgent basis in order to ensure the achievement of the management goals defined by the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).;"[Sabatella, Evelina C.; Gambino, Monica; Malvarosa, Loretta; Sabatella, Rosaria] NISEA Fisheries & Aquaculture Econ Res, Salerno, Italy; [Colloca, Francesco; Fiorentino, Fabio] CNR, IAMC, Mazara Del Vallo, Italy; [Colloca, Francesco] Sapienza Univ Roma, Dipartimento Biol & Biotecnol C Darwin, Rome, Italy; [Coppola, Gianluigi] Univ Salerno, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Stat, Fisciano, Italy";;Sabatella, EC (corresponding author), NISEA Fisheries & Aquaculture Econ Res, Salerno, Italy.;e.sabatella@nisea.eu;"Fiorentino, Fabio/AAX-2883-2020; Sabatella, Evelina Carmen/ABF-4348-2020; Coppola, Gianluigi/AAY-5161-2020";"Sabatella, Evelina Carmen/0000-0002-2129-1869; Coppola, Gianluigi/0000-0002-7715-0950; Colloca, Francesco/0000-0002-0574-2893";;;24;4;4;2;5;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND;;2296-7745;FRONT MAR SCI;Front.

First, we soaked traps over a 14-d period to examine how catch changes over time and modeled catch as a function of soak time using two three-parameter models from the literature. Maximum catches were obtained after 11 soak days before declining. Models applied to catch and soak time data fit reasonably well and may be used to correct for changes in soak time to develop abundance estimates. Second, we used a modified trap equipped with video cameras to observe fish interactions, including entry and escapement dynamics with traps over short (similar to 60 min) soak times. Out of all the fish that were observed entering the trap, 48 (84.2%) exited while 9 (15.8%) were caught. Patterns for cumulative distributions of entries and exits indicated that entry and escapement behaviors may lead to saturation in Black Sea Bass traps used in the Middle Atlantic Bight. Additional study is needed to examine the dynamics of the saturation process and to elucidate how well trap catches reflect true abundance.;"[Cullen, Daniel W.] Univ Maryland Eastern Shore, Dept Nat Sci, Henry Tanner Airway Sci Bldg,Bldg 915 30806 Univ, Princess Anne, MD 21853 USA; [Stevens, Bradley G.] Univ Maryland Eastern Shore, Living Marine Resources Cooperat Sci Ctr, Dept Nat Sci, Henry Tanner Airway Sci Bldg,Bldg 915 30806 Univ, Princess Anne, MD 21853 USA";;Cullen, DW (corresponding author), Univ Maryland Eastern Shore, Dept Nat Sci, Henry Tanner Airway Sci Bldg,Bldg 915 30806 Univ, Princess Anne, MD 21853 USA.;dwcullen@umes.edu;Cullen, Daniel W/AAN-1510-2020;;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Living Marine Resources Cooperative Science Center at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore;"The authors would like to thank boat captains Chet and Wesley Townsend of the FV Andrew G for their invaluable help in the field; thanks also to the students who assisted with data collection.

Two intensely trawled gulfs were compared with two gulfs from which trawling has been excluded for 15 years. The results show a significant effect of trawling on the faunal assemblage and when comparing the mean biomass and the whole isotopic composition of the benthic communities. A similar pattern, although not significant, was found for total abundance, biomass, production/biomass ratio and diversity. Higher abundance and lower biomass were found in the untrawled areas, attributable to the presence of more numerous yet smaller individuals, possibly a consequence of more abundant larger predators that are not removed by trawling, and consequent higher predatory pressure on the benthic macrofauna. The SIMPER analysis evidenced a dominance of burrowing deposit feeding worms (Paraonidae and Cossuridae) in trawled areas, as a result of increased mechanical alteration and hence more organic matter available as food. In contrast, the response to trawling as drawn by the use of trophic markers (i.e., stable isotopes) was less clear. While delta N-15 of benthic taxa did not vary significantly between untrawled and trawled areas, delta C-13 was higher in trawled areas possibly due to high sediment resuspension and consequent intense microbial activity. Mixing models confirmed higher reliance to a detritus-based food web for benthic organisms in the trawled areas. Standard Ellipse Areas (SEAc) as a measure of community niche width were slightly larger in trawled areas, likely due to higher generalism triggered by alteration/removal of the original benthic community.

A copper alloy net (brass net) cage and a conventional net cage with Cu2O antifouling paint were established at a fish farm in Bathy Limani Bay, Paleros, Aetolia Acarnania region, Greece, for a 1-year period. Copper concentrations in abiotic (water, sediment, particulate matter) and biotic (organisms) samples were measured. The biological effects of copper on organisms (mussels, farmed fish) were further assessed with a battery of biochemical biomarkers (acetylcholinesterase, catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, metallothioneins). During the first 6 months of cage installations, the copper alloy (brass) net seemed to release more Cu to the surrounding environment and affect the biota more compared to the conventional net, although non-significant correlations were found between biotic and abiotic variables. However, at the end of the experimental period, equilibrium was reached in the copper alloy (brass) net cage with similar values of dissolved Cu and Cu in organisms as the conventional net cage. An exception to these results was the sampling of August 2013, where an increased effect on water chemistry and mussels in the conventional cage was observed, which may be attributed to the use of antifoulants on the examined conventional net or on the surrounding conventional nets. No accumulation of Cu in sediment was detected. No consistent temporal or spatial trend was observed for biochemical biomarkers. In addition, for both experimental cages and in all sampling periods, dissolved Cu never reached the maximum permissible limits in the Greek legislation, and Cu concentrations in the farmed fish and mussels do not exceed established limits for edible parts set by Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Statement of relevance: In this manuscript, a set of methodological tools and indicators were studied in order to assess the potential impacts of the use of copper alloy aquaculture nets on farmed fish and, eventually, the marine environment of the Mediterranean Sea. The authors believe that the aim of this work is within the journal's scope and the presented results, analysis and interpretation will be of interest to scientists involved in various aspects of aquaculture (management, environmental pollution, ecotoxicology, food safety etc.).

In our article, we address this concern by theorizing the variety of human responses to SE traps and the effect of these responses on trap dynamics. Besides (adaptive) capacities, we theorize desires, abilities and opportunities as important additional drivers to explain the diversity of human responses to traps. Using these theoretical concepts, we construct a typology of human responses to SE traps, and illustrate its empirical relevance with three cases of SE traps: Swedish Baltic Sea fishery; amaXhosa rural livelihoods; and Pamir smallholder farming.

This study focuses on the survival capacity of Nephrops norvegicus discarded from trawlers of the Bay of Biscay (France). Three sea trials were conducted on board 3 commercial trawlers and 15 fishing operations were sampled. The vitality of Nephrops was classed into three categories (healthy, moribund or dead) before release at sea and samples of healthy and moribund individuals were kept in captivity on Nephrops grounds for three days. A Generalised Linear Model was used to examine the variability in the proportion of healthy Nephrops discarded, which was significantly influenced by tow duration, duration of air exposure and temperature, as well as individual length. By combining the results on vitality before release at sea with those on survival in captivity following re-immersion, resampled by bootstrapping, it was calculated that 51% [42-60%] of discarded Nephrops would survive after three days of re-immersion. We discuss the sources of variability in survival rate, as well as the implications of a potential exemption from the landing obligation for this species.

Bottom-trawl fisheries are widespread and cause mortality of benthic invertebrates, which in turn may lead to a decrease in the availability of prey for target fish species. Exploitation also reduces the abundance of the fish species themselves. Modelling studies have shown that bottom trawling could lead to both increases and decreases in fish production. but so far empirical evidence to test these ideas has been very limited. We hypothesize that the effect of bottom trawling on the food intake and condition of fish depends on how the ratio of prey to consumers changes with increasing fishing pressure. 2. We assessed the impact of bottom trawling on the food availability, condition and stomach contents of three flatfishes and the Norway lobster in an area in the Kattegat that is characterized by a steep commercial bottom-trawling gradient due to the establishment of an area closed to all fisheries, but otherwise has homogeneous environmental conditions. 3. For plaice, prey biomass initially decreased at a slower rate with trawling than the biomass of fish, and as a result, the amount of food available per plaice increased before decreasing at trawling frequencies >5 times year(-1). This pattern was mirrored in both the condition and stomach contents of plaice and for long-rough dab. 4. No effect of trawling on dab prey and condition was found. Conversely, the condition of the main target species Norway lobster increased as its biomass decreased with increased trawling intensities. 5. Together, these results support the idea that when the abundance of the prey declines in response to exploitation, the ratio of the prey to consumer biomass will determine whether exploitation will result in an increase or a decrease in the food intake and condition of the predator. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our study indicates that fish production may be maximized by keeping bottom-trawling intensities relatively low, although this may negatively affect the economically more important Nephrops fishery. The effects of bottom trawls may be mitigated by switching to gears, which affect prey availability to a lesser extent, such as pots or creels.;"[Hiddink, Jan G.; Balestrini, Stephen; Sciberras, Marija; Cendrier, Marine; Bowyer, Rosie; Kaiser, Michel J.] Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Gwynedd, Wales; [Moranta, Joan] Ctr Oceanog Baleares, IEO, Moll Ponent S-N, Palma De Mallorca 07015, Spain; [Skold, Mattias; Jonsson, Patrik] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Inst Marine Res, Dept Aquat Resources, Turistgatan 5, SE-45330 Lysekil, Sweden; [Bastardie, Francois] Tech Univ Denmark, Sect Ecosyst Based Marine Management, Inst Aquat Resources, DK-2920 Charlottenlund, Denmark; [Hinz, Hilmar] CSIC, Mediterranean Inst Adv Studies UIB, C Miquel Marques 21, Esporles 07190, Spain";;Hiddink, JG (corresponding author), Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Gwynedd, Wales.;J.Hiddink@bangor.ac.uk;"Moranta, Joan/B-5522-2008; Hinz, Hilmar/AAH-7148-2019; Hiddink, Jan Geert/C-1238-2009";"Moranta, Joan/0000-0002-9814-0735; Hinz, Hilmar/0000-0003-4909-0089; Hiddink, Jan Geert/0000-0001-7114-830X; Bastardie, Francois/0000-0002-2669-6179; Kaiser, Michel Josef/0000-0001-8782-3621; Sciberras, Marija/0000-0002-4319-3522";"FP7 project BENTHIS [312088]; FP7 project ASSEMBLE [227799]; Sven Loven Centre for Marine Sciences; Marie Curie Fellowship LINKFISH [299552]; Swedish Research Council FORMASSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas [2012-942]";This research was supported by FP7 project BENTHIS (312088), FP7 project ASSEMBLE (227799), the Sven Loven Centre for Marine Sciences, Marie Curie Fellowship LINKFISH (299552) and the Swedish Research Council FORMAS (2012-942).;36;25;25;0;34;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-8901;1365-2664;J APPL ECOL;J.

Optical and acoustic measurements made in the water column indicate a significant trawling-induced resuspension mainly due to the scraping action of doors. It manifests as a highly dynamic turbid plume confined near the seabed, where suspended sediment concentrations can reach 200 mg l(-1). Concentration levels measured behind an alternative configuration (trawls with jumper doors instead of classical doors penetrating the sediment) are significantly lower (around 10-20 mg l(-1)), which indicates a potential limiting impact regarding the seabed. Grain size analyses of the surficial sediment led to highlight a potential reworking influence of bottom trawling. On the intensively trawled zone, this reworking manifests as an upward coarsening trend in the first 5 cm of the cores. A significant decrease in mud content (30 %) has been also witnessed on this zone between 1967 and 2014, which suggests an influence on the seabed evolution. The geometric analysis of bottom tracks (4-5-cm depth, 20-cm width) observed with a benthic video sledge was used to compute an experimental trawling-induced erosion rate of 0.13 kg m(-2). This erosion rate was combined with fishing effort data, in order to estimate trawling-induced erosion fluxes which were then compared to natural erosion fluxes over the Grande-VasiSre at monthly, seasonal and annual scales. Winter storms control the annual resuspended load and trawling contribution to annual resuspension is in the order of 1 %. However, results show that trawling resuspension can become dominant during the fishing high season (i.e., until several times the natural one in summer). In addition, the contribution of trawling-induced resuspension is shown to increase with water depth, because of the rapid decay of wave effects. Finally, the seasonal evolution of the respective contributions for erosion (mainly trawling and waves) could be mapped for the whole study area.;"[Mengual, Baptiste; Cayocca, Florence; Le Hir, Pierre] IFREMER, Ctr Bretagne, DYNECO DHYSED, ZI Pointe Diable, CS 10070, F-29280 Plouzane, France; [Draye, Robin; Laffargue, Pascal] IFREMER, Ctr Atlantique, EMH, Rue Ile Yeu,BP 21105, F-44311 Nantes 03, France; [Vincent, Benoit] IFREMER, Stn Lorient, STH LTBH, 8 Rue Francois Toullec, F-56100 Lorient, France; [Garlan, Thierry] SHOM DOPS HOM Sedimentol, 13 Rue Chatellier,CS 92803, F-29228 Brest 02, France";;Mengual, B (corresponding author), IFREMER, Ctr Bretagne, DYNECO DHYSED, ZI Pointe Diable, CS 10070, F-29280 Plouzane, France.;baptiste.mengual@ifremer.fr;Laffargue, Pascal/AAS-4618-2021;"Laffargue, Pascal/0000-0003-2126-9773; VINCENT, Benoit/0000-0002-0386-6251";"SHOM (Service Hydrographique et Oceanographique de la Marine); IFREMER (Institut Francais de Recherche pour l'Exploitation de la Mer); BENTHIS European project [312088]; Region BretagneRegion Bretagne; France Filliere Peche; IFREMER; Morgere company";This study was supported by the SHOM (Service Hydrographique et Oceanographique de la Marine) and IFREMER (Institut Francais de Recherche pour l'Exploitation de la Mer).

In particular, we focused on how many fish would need to be caught and length measured in a trawl haul in order to assess the selectivity parameters of the trawl at a designated uncertainty level. We also investigated the dependency of this uncertainty level on the experimental method used to collect data and on the potential effects of factors such as the size structure in the catch relative to the size selection of the gear. We based this study on simulated data created from two different fisheries: the Barents Sea cod (Gadus morhua) trawl fishery and the Mediterranean Sea multispecies trawl fishery represented by red mullet (Mullus barbatus). We used these two completely different fisheries to obtain results that can be used as general guidelines for other fisheries. We found that the uncertainty in the selection parameters decreased with increasing number of fish measured and that this relationship could be described by a power model. The sampling effort needed to achieve a specific uncertainty level for the selection parameters was always lower for the covered codend method compared to the paired-gear method. In many cases, the number of fish that would need to be measured to maintain a specific uncertainty level was around 10 times higher for the paired-gear method than for the covered codend method. The trends observed for the effect of sampling effort in the two fishery cases investigated were similar; therefore the guidelines presented herein should be applicable to other fisheries.";"[Herrmann, Bent] SINTEF Fisheries & Aquaculture, Fishing Gear Technol, Willemoesvej 2, DK-9850 Hirtshals, Denmark; [Sistiaga, Manu] SFA, Brattorkaia 17C, N-7010 Trondheim, Norway; [Santos, Juan] Thunen Inst Balt Sea Fisheries, Alter Hafen Sud 2, D-18069 Rostock, Germany; [Sala, Antonello] CNR, Inst Marine Sci ISMAR, I-60125 Ancona, Italy; [Herrmann, Bent] Univ Tromso, Norwegian Coll Fishery & Aquat Sci, N-9037 Tromso, Norway";;Sistiaga, M (corresponding author), SFA, Brattorkaia 17C, N-7010 Trondheim, Norway.;manu.sistiaga@sintef.no;Sala, Antonello/B-8517-2016;"Sala, Antonello/0000-0001-7066-1152; Herrmann, Bent/0000-0003-1325-6198";"SINTEF Fisheries and Aquaculture (Norway)SINTEF; National Research Council (CNR) - Institute of Marine Sciences (ISMAR) (Italy); Thunen Institute for Baltic Sea Fisheries (Germany)";The following institutes funded this work: SINTEF Fisheries and Aquaculture (Norway)(www.sintef.no), National Research Council (CNR) - Institute of Marine Sciences (ISMAR) (Italy) (www.ismar.cnr.it) and the Thunen Institute for Baltic Sea Fisheries (Germany) (www.ti.bund.de).;22;9;9;0;9;PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE;SAN FRANCISCO;1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA;1932-6203;;PLOS ONE;PLoS One;Aug/25;2016;11;8;;;;;;e0161512;10.1371/journal.pone.0161512;;;22;Multidisciplinary Sciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Science & Technology - Other Topics;DU5NN;WOS:000382258600052;27560696;gold, Green Published, Green Submitted;;;10/01/2022

Between 2011 and 2014, M. asterias comprised 92.6% ( n= 2418) of the total elasmobranch catch ( n= 2612) by the licenced group of taggers within the Dutch Delta of which 2244 M. asterias were fin-tagged with plastic rototags. Sex and total length ( LT) composition inside the eastern tidal basin ( Oosterschelde) were significantly different, i.e. more females and larger individuals, than outside indicating a pupping ground, which was confirmed by the capture of 30 newborn pups (<= 32 cm). The distribution pattern of reported recaptured M. asterias ( return-rate 3.6%, n= 80) showed a circannual migration between summering in the southern North Sea and wintering in the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay, and suggests that M. asterias is philopatric. The Dutch angling season for M. asterias runs from approximately mid-May to mid-October when the water temperature is above 13 degrees C. Recaptures of eight mature females, but no males in the Bay of Biscay, indicate partial spatial segregation by sex, where mature females migrate over larger distances than immature females and males. These observations, with the absence of recaptures in other known summering areas ( i.e. the Irish Sea and Bristol Channel), suggest that the southern North Sea is used by a separate population. Implications for management and recommendations to improve and expand the study approach are discussed. (C) 2016 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles;"[Breve, N. W.

This effect has also been documented in Mediterranean trawl fisheries. In contrast, no information is available with regard to the effect of increasing mesh number in the circumference of square-mesh codends on the size selection of round fish and flat fish species. A field study was devised to bridge this gap and formulate proposals aimed at improving trawl fishery management. Size selection data were collected for a round fish species, red mullet (Mullus barbatus), and two flat fish species, Mediterranean scaldfish (Arnoglossus laterna) and solenette (Buglossidium luteum). Fishing trials were conducted in the Adriatic Sea (Central Mediterranean) using three square-mesh codends that differed only in mesh number around the circumference. Results demonstrated that increasing the number of meshes from 107 to 213 reduced the 50% retention length (L50) for red mullet by 2.5 cm but did not affect size selection for the two flat fish species. In some fisheries, regulatory provisions regarding the number of meshes in the circumference should therefore be carefully considered both for diamond- and square-mesh codends.;"[Sala, Antonello; De Carlo, Francesco; Lucchetti, Alessandro] Italian Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Marine Sci ISMAR, Ancona, Italy; [Brcic, Jure] Univ Split, Dept Marine Studies, Split, Croatia; [Herrmann, Bent] SINTEF Fisheries & Aquaculture, Fishing Gear Technol, North Sea Sci Pk, Hirtshals, Denmark; [Herrmann, Bent] Univ Tromso, Tromso, Norway";;Sala, A (corresponding author), Italian Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Marine Sci ISMAR, Ancona, Italy.;a.sala@ismar.cnr.it;"Lucchetti, Alessandro/AAV-7188-2020; Sala, Antonello/B-8517-2016; lucchetti, alessandro/K-7264-2012; Brcic, Jure/D-4337-2017";"Lucchetti, Alessandro/0000-0001-8418-9848; Sala, Antonello/0000-0001-7066-1152; Herrmann, Bent/0000-0003-1325-6198";"European project BENTHIS: Benthic ecosystem fisheries impact study - EC Commission through the Seventh Framework Programme [KBBE 2012.1.2-09, 312088]; Flagship Project RITMARE The Italian Research for the Sea; Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research within the National Research Programme";"This work was partially funded by the European project BENTHIS: Benthic ecosystem fisheries impact study (KBBE 2012.1.2-09, Grant Agreement No. 312088), financed by the EC Commission through the Seventh Framework Programme and by the Flagship Project RITMARE The Italian Research for the Sea, coordinated by the Italian National Research Council and funded by the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research within the 2011-2013 National Research Programme.; This work was partially funded by the European project BENTHIS: Benthic ecosystem fisheries impact study (KBBE 2012.1.2-09, Grant Agreement No. 312088), financed by the EC Commission through the Seventh Framework Programme and by the Flagship Project RITMARE The Italian Research for the Sea, coordinated by the Italian National Research Council and funded by the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research within the 20112013 National Research Programme.

Numerous devices and fishing gears aiming at improving both species and size selectivity have been developed and implemented by various fisheries. Selective gears are often developed in collaboration between scientists and fishers. Part of the development is a controlled scientific test documenting the selectivity effect. In this study, we compared two versions of a mandatory escape panel that were introduced into the mixed species fishery in the Skagerrak in 2013: the version implemented in the legislation (pre-implementation version) and the version the industry was using one year after its implementation, the post-implementation version (post-version). The post-version went through some simple adjustments that resulted in a panel section with a larger vertical distance between the upper panel (escape panel) and the bottom panel compared to the pre-version. Both designs are legal and considered identical. The results of this study showed significantly higher catches (lower selectivity) for the post-version for all five species examined; cod (Gadus morhua), saithe (Pollachius virens), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus). Thus the modification by fishers of certain gear properties not specified in the legislation can significantly influence the efficiency of an escape panel. We discuss to what extent catch quotas instead of the former landings quotas could provide the economic incentives for fishers to actively use selective gear designs more optimally and thereby play an active role in the management of fisheries.";"[Krag, Ludvig A.; Feekings, Jordan; Karlsen, Junita D.] Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Aqua, North Sea Sci Pk, DK-9850 Hirtshals, Denmark; [Herrmann, Bent] SINTEF, Fisheries & Aquaculture Fishing Gear Technol, Willemoesvej 2, DK-9850 Hirtshals, Denmark";;Karlsen, JD (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Aqua, North Sea Sci Pk, DK-9850 Hirtshals, Denmark.;lak@aqua.dtu.dk;Feekings, Jordan/AAJ-1245-2021;"Feekings, Jordan/0000-0001-9103-7332; Krag, Ludvig Ahm/0000-0002-1531-1499; Karlsen, Junita Diana/0000-0002-0496-4638; Herrmann, Bent/0000-0003-1325-6198";"Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries of Denmark; EU H2020 DiscardLess Project";This study was conducted with financial support from the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries of Denmark and the EU H2020 DiscardLess Project.

The electrotrawl for brown shrimp employing low frequency pulsed direct current (PDC) selectively induces a startle response in shrimp engendering decreased environmental impact and reduced by-catch. Prior to commercially introducing this fishing technique, data on its impact on marine organisms are crucial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the short-term effects of this pulse used for electrotrawling for brown shrimp on five marine fish species inhabiting shrimp fishery areas. For this purpose, 25 European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), 30 Dover sole (Solea solea), 20 Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), 19 bull-rout (Myoxocephalus scorpius) and 20 armed bullhead (Agonus cataphractus) were exposed to the shrimp pulse for 5 s. Before, during and till 20 min following exposure, the behaviour of the fish was monitored. Twenty-four hours post-exposure, all fish were sacrificed, inspected and samples for histological analysis were taken from the gills, dorsal muscle and internal organs. To investigate possible spinal injuries radiographs were taken. Behavioural responses were variable and species dependant. Roundfish species, cod in particular, were displaying more active and agitated fast swimming activity during exposure. The majority of flatfish showed only minor reactions and remained close to the bottom throughout the observation period. However, 15% of the exposed sole actively swam upwards during exposure. Mild multifocal petechial haemorrhages and suffusion, encountered mainly in plaice and sole, were not significantly different between exposed and control groups. Upon histological examination, in two exposed plaice, a focal small haemorrhage between muscle fibres was found, which was not encountered in control animals. In addition, the number of melanomacrophage centres in the spleen of exposed cod was significantly higher than in the non exposed animals. In conclusion, under the circumstances as adopted in this study, the electrical field seemed to have only limited immediate impact on the exposed animals. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, there is recent growing evidence that small-scale fisheries may be the largest threat to marine species of conservation concern. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential impact of the trammel net fishery on elasmobranchs in the Gulf of Gabes, Southern Tunisia. Data are based on 191 shrimp trammel net set (40 mm stretched mesh size) surveys conducted aboard commercial fishing vessels from May to July 2009. Five species of the small coastal elasmobranchs (Mustelus mustelus (Linnaeus, 1758), Mustelus punctulatus Risso 1827, Dasyatis pastinaca (Linnaeus, 1758), Dasyatis marmorata (Steindachner, 1892) and Torpedo torpedo (Linnaeus, 1758)) and two species from the large coastal shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus (Nardo, 1827) and Carcharhinus brevipinna (Muller & Henle, 1839)) were recognized as by-catch in this fishery. Elasmobranch by-catch was dominated by sharks (90.3%), smoothhound sharks Mustelus sp. being by far the most important (88.9%) and reflecting their abundance in the area; 58% of the sets caught at least one specimen, with 4.8 +/- 1.3 caught per set. Captures were composed essentially of neonate and juvenile sharks, while the batoids were dominated by mature individuals. This study shows that shrimp trammel nets represent a considerable source of mortality for early life stages of elasmobranch species in the Gulf of Gabes. Additionally, there was a high density of neonates and small juvenile M. mustelus in the Sfax zone, suggesting that these nearshore waters are a nursery grounds for smoothhound sharks. Further research should focus on the incidents of by-catch and evaluate the potential solutions to allow trammel net fisheries to coexist alongside the elasmobranch species.";"[Saidi, B.; Enajjar, S.; Bradai, M.

Pulse trawls reduce the fuel consumption, reduce adverse impact on the ecosystem but cause injuries in gadoids. We describe the design and electrical properties of pulse trawls currently in use and study the behavioural response and injuries in cod exposed to electrical pulses under controlled conditions. Pulse trawls operate at an average power of 0.7 kW m(-1) beam length and a duty cycle of similar to 2%. The electric field is heterogeneous with highest field strength occurring close to the conductors. Cod were exposed to three different pulse types for a range of field strengths, frequencies, and duty cycles. Two size classes were tested representing cod that escape through the meshes (11-17 cm) and market-sized cod that are retained in the net (34-56 cm). Cod exposed to a field strength of >= 37 V m(-1) responded by moderate-to-strong muscular contractions. Some of the large cod (n = 260) developed haemorrhages and fractures in the spine, and haemal and neural arches in the tail part of the body. The probability of injuries increased with field strength and decreased when frequency was increased from 100 to 180 Hz. None of the small cod (n = 132) were injured and all survived.

GIS-analyses of VMS-data from trawling in the Kattegat by both Danish (2005-2009) and Swedish (2007-2009) vessels show that 95% of all trawling occurs below 22 m depth. Most activity takes place on homogeneous benthic habitats with muddy sediment at depths below the halocline and with almost the same salinity across the entire area. Furthermore, the estimate of trawled area demonstrated that the habitats are nearly 100% impacted, and frequencies of trawling beneath 100 m depth can reach 20 events per year. Multivariate analysis of community composition could not discriminate between lightly trawled and heavily trawled areas. However, a strong habitat selectivity of the trawl activity and inter-correlation between trawl activity and depth-related community structures complicated interpretation of the results. Species with biological traits previously categorized as sensitive to physical disturbance showed higher abundance in areas with low trawl activity compared to areas with higher activity. Thus, the Kattegat has been impacted to an extent where areas with reference conditions for certain habitats below 22 m no longer exist. Consequently, it is unknown how the benthic communities would have appeared without trawl disturbance and, thus, difficult to determine the impact of continued disturbance.;"[Pommer, Christina D.; Olesen, Michael] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Strandpromenaden 5, DK-3000 Helsingor, Denmark; [Hansen, Jorgen L.

A catch-based method was also applied to estimate its maximum sustainable yield (MSY). The effect on the long-term spawning stock biomass and yield of a wide range of exploitation regimes (combinations of F and selectivity) was investigated using an age-structured population model parameterised for Mediterranean anglerfish stocks. The analysis indicated an increasing trend of anglerfish fishing mortality (F) in the eastern Mediterranean from the mid-1990s onwards, and that recent catches were 41% higher than the median MSY estimate. Catching Mediterranean anglerfish at least three years after they mature at an F=0.4-1year(-1) would ensure high yields at sustainable levels of stock depletion.

The device affected neither bottom trawl technical performances (horizontal and vertical net opening and door spread) nor did it increase the required towing force, hence fuel consumption remained constant. Comparison of commercial catches for the major species demonstrated that using the TED did not affect catching efficiency, while it reduced the amount of debris. The device did not influence the size of commercial species, leaving the selective performance of the trawl unmodified. Underwater video camera recordings documented that fish caught in the net swam through the grid and easily reached the cod-end, missing the TED escape opening. Easy storage and improved catch retention compared with previous devices tested in this area make the present flexible TED a practical and valuable solution to reduce turtle bycatch in coastal Mediterranean demersal multispecies fisheries.;"[Lucchetti, Alessandro; Punzo, Elisa; Virgili, Massimo] Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Marine Sci ISMAR Ancona Italy, Largo Fiera Pesca 1, I-60125 Ancona, Italy";;Lucchetti, A (corresponding author), Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Marine Sci ISMAR Ancona Italy, Largo Fiera Pesca 1, I-60125 Ancona, Italy.;a.lucchetti@ismar.cnr.it;"Lucchetti, Alessandro/AAV-7188-2020; lucchetti, alessandro/K-7264-2012; Virgili, Massimo/Q-4506-2018";"Lucchetti, Alessandro/0000-0001-8418-9848; ";European CommunityEuropean Commission [LIFE12 NAT/IT/000937];This research study was authorised by the Italian Coast Guard.

Eight models were considered to describe the size selective performance of the TO and T90 codends for each species; four traditional models, along with four models that considered contact probability (the fraction of fish that will not make proper contact with the codend meshes for size-dependent escape). Fifteen hauls were completed in the North Sea, fishing both codends simultaneously. The results demonstrated that the T90 codend significantly increased size selectivity for the two roundfish species investigated, whiting (Merlangius merlangus) and pouting (Trisopterus luscus), and significantly decreased size selectivity of the three flatfish species, sole (Solea solea), plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), and dab (Limanda limanda). Selection range (SR) values were similar for both roundfish species with each codend, but were significantly reduced for all flatfish species by the T90 codend. Models that considered contact probability provided the best model for four of the species with T90 (pouting, sole, plaice, and dab), and one species with TO (sole). Lack of adequate contact with the T90 meshes could be a result of the combined effects of increased flow through the T90 codend due to 190 meshes remaining more open than TO meshes during towing, and the relative high towing speeds of beam trawls. This study concludes that although a T90 codend reduces the size selectivity of flatfish, the lower SR of the T90 codend could be paired with a larger T90 codend mesh size for improved flatfish selectivity, and that a T90 mesh codend increases the size selectivity for commonly encountered roundfish in the Belgian beam trawl fishery.

Aim of this survey was to analyze zooplankton composition, abundance and biomass and compare the results with previous studies to reveal possible populations and environmental changes. The mean zooplankton abundance varied between 1,200-6,000 ind. m(-3) and biomass 6.70-25.70 mg DW m(-3), according to the site. Copepods constituted the main fraction of zooplankton community, and Oithona similis and Paracalanus indicus successively dominated during autumn-winter and spring-summer. The dinoflagellate Noctiluca scintillans was one of the major zooplankton components, and developed high numbers during February-April, becoming common in neritic and coastal regions. The singularity of the zooplankton from Annaba Bay is the prevalence of P. indicus throughout the entire bay and the decrease in Acartia (Acartiura) discaudata and Acartia (Acartiura) clausi (with respect to previous years), possibly replaced by A. negligens. Additionally, Oithona nana abundance markedly decreased with the large development of O. similis. Annaba Bay also differs from other similar Mediterranean coastal areas by the large development of Centropages ponticus populations during the warm period. Among the identified copepod species, the alien species Pseudodiaptomus australiensis and P. arabicus are reported for the first time in the Mediterranean Sea. The occurrence of copepodid V stages of P. australiensis suggests that this species survives and reproduces in Annaba Bay, but so far without developing an abundant population.;"[Ounissi, M.; Laskri, H.; Khelifi-Touhami, M.] Univ Badji Mokhtar, Dept Marine Sci, POB 12, Sidi Ammar 23000, Annaba, Algeria";;Ounissi, M (corresponding author), Univ Badji Mokhtar, Dept Marine Sci, POB 12, Sidi Ammar 23000, Annaba, Algeria.;Ounissi_mk@yahoo.com;Rosso, Antonietta/E-5660-2017;Rosso, Antonietta/0000-0001-5565-9513;Algerian Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research under the CNEPRU research project [D00L03UN230120120003];This study was funded by the Algerian Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research under the CNEPRU research project (D00L03UN230120120003).

Due to quota overages and concerns about entanglement of federally protected North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis, the commercial harvest of Black Sea Bass Centropristis striata using pot gear has been prohibited in the southeastern United States in winter since 2009. Following the rebuilding of the Black Sea Bass stock and a change to the start date of the fishing year, the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC) increased the commercial annual catch limit (ACL) and is considering twelve alternatives to the pot gear closure that would revise the timing and/or spatial extent of the closure. Changes to this closure could affect the annual catch of Black Sea Bass and increase the risk of right whale entanglement in pot gear. Using historical fishing effort, landings, and right whale sightings data, we projected Black Sea Bass landings and the relative risk of right whale entanglement for each closure alternative, expressed in relative risk units (RRU). We predict that the ACL would be caught, resulting in an in-season closure for most of the proposed SAFMC closure alternatives. The relative risk of entanglement, estimated from the spatial and temporal overlap of Black Sea Bass pot gear fishing effort and right whale relative abundance, was lower for some alternatives than for others, and the relative differences between alternatives were consistent among uncertainty scenarios. The SAFMC's preferred alternative is projected to result in a relatively low increase in risk to North Atlantic right whales (3-15 RRU off North Carolina and 1-12 RRU off Florida-South Carolina). This framework demonstrates the use of temporally dynamic spatial overlays in assessing the impacts of time-area closures with multiple objectives.;"[Farmer, Nicholas A.; Powell, Jessica R.] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm Fisheries, Southeast Reg Off, 263 13th Ave Southeast, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA; [Gowan, Timothy A.] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, 100 8th Ave Southeast, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA; [Zoodsma, Barbara J.] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm Fisheries, Southeast Reg Off, 2382 Sadler Rd, Fernandina Beach, FL 32034 USA";;Farmer, NA (corresponding author), Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm Fisheries, Southeast Reg Off, 263 13th Ave Southeast, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.;nick.farmer@noaa.gov;;Gowan, Timothy/0000-0002-0082-1621;;;43;7;7;1;19;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1942-5120;;MAR COAST FISH;Mar.

Current knowledge on the response of benthic communities to the impact of trawling is still rudimentary. In the present study, we used data collected in the Barents Sea during 2011 to assess the vulnerability of benthic species to trawling, based on the risk of being caught or damaged by a bottom trawl. Using trait table analysis, we identified 23 high-risk benthic species, which include large weight and upraised taxa as easily caught by a bottom trawl. We further identified a low-risk category containing 245 taxa/species and a medium-risk category with 80 species. A clear decline in biomass was noted for all three categories when comparing trawled vs. untrawled areas. This suggests that trawling significantly affects the biomass of all species, but predominantly the high-risk taxa. Some Barents Sea regions were particularly susceptible to trawling due to the dominance of the high-risk species, including Geodia sponges in the southwestern Barents Sea, basket stars (Gorgonocephalus) in the northern Barents Sea, sea pen (Umbellula encrinus) on the shelf facing the Arctic Ocean, and sea cucumber (Cucumaria frondosa) in shallow southern areas. These findings can guide management decisions to meet targets set by the United Nations Convention of Biological Diversity and the OSPAR Commission (Protecting and Conserving the North-East Atlantic and its Resources). We specifically recommend management action in the southwestern and the northwestern Barents Sea and on the Arctic shelf facing the Arctic Ocean.;"[Jorgensen, Lis Lindal; Planque, Benjamin; Thangstad, Trude Hauge; Certain, Gregoire] Inst Marie Res, Postboks 6404, N-9294 Tromso, Norway; [Certain, Gregoire] SLU, Inst Coastal Res, Skolgatan 6, S-74242 Oregrund, Sweden";;Jorgensen, LL (corresponding author), Inst Marie Res, Postboks 6404, N-9294 Tromso, Norway.;lis.lindal.joergensen@imr.no;Planque, Benjamin/D-2729-2013;Planque, Benjamin/0000-0002-0557-7410;;;86;33;34;1;35;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;1054-3139;1095-9289;ICES J MAR SCI;ICES J.

The ecological importance of habitat-forming megabenthos and their vulnerability to trawling is acknowledged, but studies on effects are few. Our objective was to investigate chronic effects of otter trawl fishery on substratum and megabenthos on the shelf (50-400 m) and slope (400-2000 m) in the southern Barents Sea. The study area represents a wide range in the history of fishing intensity (FI). Physical impact of trawling, density of trawl marks (TMs), was quantified on 250 video transects from shelf and slope, and megabenthos (. 2 cm) composition was studied on 149 video transects from the shelf. The number of satellite-recorded vessels within grid cells 5 x 5 km was used as a proxy for FI in the TM analysis and for the megabenthos records within a 2-km radius around the transects. The effects of using different search area sizes were tested. Patterns in the density of TMs and megabenthos composition were compared with FI using linear regression and correspondence analysis. Occurrence of TMs was not directly related to FI but to bottom type, whereas megabenthos density and diversity showed a negative relation.

When traps are deployed in surveys, the data gathered are often used to develop an index of abundance. However, trap catches are known to saturate over time for various reasons, such as space limitation of the gear or intraspecific interactions, and these features can dissociate the catch from local abundance. In this study, we develop a hierarchical state-space model of trap dynamics that is fit to data in a Bayesian framework. The model links trap catch to estimated local abundance, and additionally provides direct estimates of capture probability. For demonstration, we apply the model to data on black sea bass (Centropristis striata), which were collected using chevron traps combined with video cameras to give continuous-time observations of trap entries and exits. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that trap catch is generally proportional to local abundance. The model has potential application to surveys where animals not only enter a trap, but also may exit, such that the apparent trap saturation occurs because the system approaches equilibrium.;"[Shertzer, Kyle W.; Bacheler, Nathan M.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, SE Fisheries Ctr, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA; [Coggins, Lewis G., Jr.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Yukon Delta Natl Wildlife Refuge, Bethel, AK USA; [Fieberg, John] Univ Minnesota, Dept Fisheries Wildlife & Conservat Biol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA";;Shertzer, KW (corresponding author), NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, SE Fisheries Ctr, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA.;kyle.shertzer@noaa.gov;Fieberg, John/Y-3988-2019;"Fieberg, John/0000-0002-3180-7021; Shertzer, Kyle/0000-0001-7196-5959";;;33;6;6;2;9;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;1054-3139;1095-9289;ICES J MAR SCI;ICES J.

Here we present a quantification of damage to sites from the Aegean and Black seas through high resolution imaging of 45 shipwrecks discovered by the EN Nautilus expeditions, 2009-2012. These shipwrecks are part of a modern submarine landscape that is heavily damaged by trawls, which also remove sediment and smooth out natural features of the seabed. We quantify the severity of this threat to archaeological sites through repeat visits to one ancient shipwreck and quantify the change to the seabed over a period of eleven months. The results illustrate the benefits of enforced areas of restricted bottom trawling (Marine Protected Areas) to the in situ preservation of shipwreck sites and to natural seabed features and benthic habitats. Careful marine spatial planning and coordinated management of fishing activity can mitigate this destructive activity. In addition, we counter the claim made by some commercial salvors who use trawl damage as an excuse to salvage artifacts from wrecks, further destroying historically significant sites for profit.

More than 100,000 turtles are estimated to be caught annually due to fishing practices; 10-50% die. Bottom trawls are among the fishing gears exerting the worst impact on sea turtle populations, especially in the coastal waters of Tunisia and Libya, northern Adriatic Sea, the Mediterranean coastal areas of Turkey and Egypt, where the continental shelf is large and turtles in the demersal stage are commonly found also in winter. Seven adult-sized loggerhead turtles captured incidentally by bottom trawls in the central-northern Adriatic Sea and treated in rescue centres were tagged with satellite transmitters before release. In this paper Italian bottom trawl track data obtained from vessel monitoring systems (VMSs) were analysed by VMSbase R suite to identify the areas of maximum fishing effort in the Adriatic. These data were combined with satellite information on turtle distribution to provide an interaction index enabling prediction of potential trawl turtle interaction hotspots and periods. The present pilot study can be considered as a risk-analysis approach directed at identifying the areas and times of possible trawling turtle interactions in a Mediterranean trawl fishery. By identifying the areas and seasons at highest risk of turtle bycatch, the index here developed has the potential to provide key information to design and implement mitigation strategies. Vessel monitoring system is actually in force in several countries, therefore the approach here studied might have a worldwide application. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Tested were the 44-mm diamond mesh codend as used in commercial fisheries (D44), in addition to a 50 mm diamond (D50), a 40 mm square (S40), and a 40 mm 90 degrees turned mesh (T40), respectively. Sea trials were carried out in the eastern Aegean Sea, with a local commercial trawler using a modified trawl net with 620 meshes circular mouth opening. A total of 35 valid daytime hauls (8 with D44, 9 with D50, 8 with S40 and 10 with T40) were carried out. Selectivity data were collected using the covered codend method and analysed by means of a logistic equation with the maximum-likelihood method. Mean selection curves were estimated and compared using the between-haul variations model. The mean 50% retention carapace length values (LC50) were estimated as 21.2 +/- 0.1, 23.2 +/- 0.3, 20.8 +/- 0.2 and 20.5 +/- 0.4 mm CL for D44, D50, S40, and T40, respectively. Selection range (SR) values were determined as 4.9 +/- 0.1 mm in D44, 8.7 +/- 0.3 mm in D50, 4.0 +/- 0.3 mm in S40, and 10.1 +/- 0.3 mm in T40. While haul duration and total catch among the parameters did not affect the LC50 values for the investigated codends, the value of the parameter describing the weight of P. longirostris caught in that codend showed an effect for the D50 and T40 codends. Consequently, all investigated codends yielded sufficient LC50 results when considering the minimum landing size (MLS) value imposed by the EU (20 mm CL). In conclusion, the legally allowed S40, which gave an LC50 value close to that of D44, and which would be the preferable codend in terms of its releasing characteristics for individuals under the MLS value (89%), can be used as a good alternative for the D44 (preferred by the fishermen) in the deep-water rose shrimp fishery.;"[Dereli, Hakki; Kebapcioglu, Turhan; Sen, Yusuf] Izmir Katip Celebi Univ, Fac Fisheries, TR-35620 Cigli Izmir, Turkey; [Aydin, Celalettin] Ege Univ, Fac Fisheries, TR-35100 Bornova, Turkey; [Belli, Mahmut] Mugla Prov Directorate Food Agr & Livestock, TR-48000 Mugla, Turkey; [Akpinar, Ilkay Ozcan] Cent Fisheries Res Inst, TR-61250 Yomra Trabzon, Turkey";;Dereli, H (corresponding author), Izmir Katip Celebi Univ, Fac Fisheries, TR-35620 Cigli Izmir, Turkey.;hakkidereli@gmail.com;"Kebapcioglu, Turhan/I-9677-2017; sen, yusuf/AAX-8307-2021; AKPINAR, ilkay OZCAN/AAG-6129-2019; Dereli, Hakki/AAH-7460-2019";"Kebapcioglu, Turhan/0000-0002-6230-1744; Dereli, Hakki/0000-0002-1240-8922";Coordinatorship of Scientific Research Projects of Izmir Katip Celebi University [2014-1-TEZ-42];The authors thank Z.

Traditionally fishing pressures are calculated top-down by making use of large-scale statistics such as logbook data. Here, we take a different approach starting from the gear itself (design and dimensions) to estimate the physical interactions with the seabed at the level of the individual fishing operation. We defined 14 distinct towed gear groups in European waters (eight otter trawl groups, three beam trawl groups, two demersal seine groups, and one dredge group), for which we established gear footprints. The footprint of a gear is defined as the relative contribution from individual larger gear components, such as trawl doors, sweeps, and groundgear, to the total area and severity of the gear's impact. An industry-based survey covering 13 countries provided the basis for estimating the relative impact-area contributions from individual gear components, whereas sediment penetration was estimated based on a literature review. For each gear group, a vessel size-gear size relationship was estimated to enable the prediction of gear footprint area and sediment penetration from vessel size. Application of these relationships with average vessel sizes and towing speeds provided hourly swept-area estimates by metier. Scottish seining has the largest overall gear footprint of similar to 1.6 km(2) h(-1) of which 0.08 km(2) has an impact at the subsurface level (sediment penetration >= 2 cm). Beam trawling for flatfish ranks low when comparing overall footprint size/hour but ranks substantially higher when comparing only impact at the subsurface level (0.19 km(2)h(-1)). These results have substantial implications for the definition, estimation, and monitoring of fishing pressure indicators, which are discussed in the context of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management.;"[Eigaard, Ole R.; Bastardie, Francois; Dinesen, Grete E.; Mortensen, Lars O.; Nielsen, J.

The framework that can be used at regional and local scales provides indicators for both trawling pressure and ecological impact. It builds on high-resolution maps of trawling intensity and considers the physical effects of trawl gears on the seabed, on marine taxa, and on the functioning of the benthic ecosystem. Within the framework, a reductionist approach is applied that breaks down a fishing gear into its components, and a number of biological traits are chosen to determine either the vulnerability of the benthos to the impact of that gear component, or to provide a proxy for their ecological role. The approach considers gear elements, such as otter boards, twin trawl clump, and groundrope, and sweeps that herd the fish. The physical impact of these elements on the seabed, comprising scraping of the seabed, sediment mobilization, and penetration, is a function of the mass, size, and speed of the individual component. The impact of the elements on the benthic community is quantified using a biological-trait approach that considers the vulnerability of the benthic community to trawl impact (e.g. sediment position, morphology), the recovery rate (e.g. longevity, maturation age, reproductive characteristics, dispersal), and their ecological role. The framework is explored to compare the indicators for pressure and ecological impact of bottom trawling in three main seabed habitat types in the North Sea. Preliminary results show that the Sublittoral mud (EUNIS A5.3) is affected the most due to the combined effect of intensive fishing and large proportions of long-lived taxa.;"[Rijnsdorp, A.

In order to reduce bycatches of shark we tested an excluder grid with 90 mm bar spacing during experimental fishing in the Tyrrhenian Sea (Western Mediterranean). Data collected made it possible to simultaneously evaluate catch losses of two commercial species: Nephrops norvegicus (Norway lobster) and Phycis blennoides (greater forkbeard). The escape outlet ahead of the grid and the codend were both mounted with a cover in order to collect escaped fish ahead of the grid and through the codend meshes. We used a structural model to estimate the contribution of the individual selective processes consisting of the excluder grid and the size selective codend. The 90 mm excluder grid did not prove to be efficient in excluding G. melastomus, while it excuded more of P. blennoides. Catches of N. norvegicus were also affected by the presence of the grid, but not as much as the catches of other two species. The results obtained for the experimental grid + codend setup were then compared with the estimated selectivity for the codend alone setup. Furthermore, byway of explorative simulation with other grid bar spacing, we concluded that reducing the grid bar spacing to 70 mm would provide better compromise between the reduction of G. melastomus as bycatch and the catch rate of P. blennoides and N. norvegicus.

However, a potential for management synergy arises if fisheries related benefits can be associated with the protection of shipwreck sites. This study reviews fish abundance and community assemblage on several ancient shipwreck sites in the Aegean Sea. In this region, the presence or absence of fishing has been correlated to shipwreck condition. The results indicate that, on average, wrecks in worse condition (heavily fished) had 55% lower species richness, 57% lower abundance, and 41% lower diversity than wrecks in pristine condition, though only the patterns for abundance and species richness were statistically significant. No statistically significant change in fish community composition between fished and unfished wrecks was observed, though community composition between shallow water and deep water wrecks was statistically different. This research highlights the potential benefit of marine protected areas around areas of high density of shipwrecks that can both protect these sites and increase local fisheries by preserving these artificial reefs.

Indeed, this approach could complement data collection through trawl surveys and onboard observers, which is usually expensive and thus, does not allow much spatio-temporal coverage. Within the EU participatory research project, GAP2, electronic logbooks were installed on board otter-trawlers to collect haul-by-haul geo-referenced catch data in the Adriatic Sea (NW Mediterranean Sea). Between September 2012 and December 2013, catches of some of the most important otter-trawl target species (8 species including teleosts, cephalopods, and crustaceans) were recorded in 3588 self-sampled hauls. Because a major concern for the use of these data is related to their quality, self-sampling was run concurrently with a scientific observers' program, which allowed the detailed monitoring of catches from 249 hauls. The latter dataset was used to test the reliability of fishers' self-sampled data and for their validation. In all species, no significant disagreement between the two datasets was observed. The full self-sampled dataset was thus used to describe the spatio-temporal changes in catches, as derived by observers' data, allowing important insights into species' life cycles. Results agreed with available literature information and fishers' experience-based knowledge, which was thus embedded in the process of data validation and results interpretation. The collaboration between scientists and fishermen was demonstrated to be a valuable approach for generating reliable fisheries data, allowing a better understanding and quantitative descriptions of species' life cycles and the attainment of a common base of knowledge for the enforcement of spatially explicit fisheries management.

This decision was expected to have a great impact on trawl fishing activities, but at the moment no real assessment of the effects on catches and possible ecological implications has been undertaken. In order to fill this gap, an assessment on the North Western Adriatic Sea coast has been performed. Landings per Unit of Effort (kilograms per boat per day) for each trawling fleet segment have been analysed, by comparing on a monthly basis the before (2007-2009) and after ban (2011-2013) period. The comparison was carried out considering total landings and the six main species targeted inside the three miles area (sand smelt, cuttlefish, red mullet, sole, turbot, and mantis shrimp). Within a general reduction of total landings, a differential effect based on the analysed m tiers was detected, with small trawlers being more negatively affected than the large and rapido ones, which showed, for some species, positive impacts. From an ecological point of view, though, no positive overall effects were detected, probably due to the fact that the adopted measure is not sufficient to reduce the overexploitation. In any case, all this is affecting the structure of the small-scale fishery in the area, since small trawlers are changing m tier, moving towards the artisanal fishery, with deep impacts on the very coastal area that the trawling ban was designated to protect, compromising all possible benefits.

A questionnaire-based survey of fishermen was conducted in the Valencia region (eastern Spain) to assess the levels of marine turtle bycatch. Interviews covered 41.3% of the bottom trawling fleet in the region and included 111 fishermen (one per boat). Results were combined with those from previous studies conducted in neighbouring regions using the same methodology to assess the global impact of bottom trawling on the western Mediterranean stock of the loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta). 2. Estimated turtle catch per unit effort (CPUE) is 0.09 turtles per vessel per month, according to the information reported by fishermen. As a consequence, the whole fleet of bottom trawlers operating off the Valencia region was involved annually in 238 turtle bycatch events (95%, CI: 173-304). 3. Ivlev's electivity index revealed that bottom trawling bycatch was higher than expected according to fishing effort in the northern part of the study area, where the continental shelf widens. 4. The fishermen's perception was that the local stock of loggerhead turtles is declining, and that drifting longlines and bottom trawling are, at least in part, responsible for this trend. 5. According to previous studies as well as the current results, bottom trawlers operating off mainland Spain capture mainly loggerhead turtles from the rookeries in the eastern Mediterranean, with only a low percentage of turtles of Atlantic origin. 6. Loggerhead turtle bycatch by bottom trawling deserves more attention in the Valencia region, particularly in its northern part. Conservation measures in the area are discussed.

Ideally, every fish passing through the grid section of the gear would make contact with the grid and be retained or released depending on size. However, in reality some fish may not be able to make contact with the grid or may actively avoid making contact with it. The purpose of the lifting panel is to make the grid contact probability, C-grid (the proportion of fish that contact the grid), as high as possible. We found that the presence of the lifting panel has a significant effect on C-grid, as the proportion of fish that came in contact with the grid was reduced from 82% when the lifting panel was present to 67% when the lifting panel was removed. For cod that were making contact with the grid, the mean selectivity parameters, L50(grid) and SRgrid, were 51.06 cm (50.26-51.87 cm) and 7.91 cm (7.33-8.48 cm), respectively, which is in agreement with values estimated for similar grid sections in previous studies. This study highlights the importance of the lifting panel for increasing the effectiveness of the grid section tested. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, this change may affect fish herding and consequently the catch efficiency of the gear. In this study we compared the catch efficiency of two different setups where the sweep length with bottom contact was different. This setup also enabled us to estimate the herding efficiency of the sweeps on the seabed. The data for this study were collected using the alternate haul method and analyzed using a new method for unpaired data. We estimated that the setup with the lifted sweeps captured on average 33% fewer cod than the setup that kept the sweeps at the seabed. The loss of catch for cod was length independent and significant for a length span between 41 and 104 cm. When sweeps were lifted above the seabed, herding was negatively impacted and fish were lost; in contrast, when on the seabed, the sweeps were able to herd (on average) 45% of the cod into the catch zone of the gear. Lifting the trawl doors from the seabed is touted as a positive development for this fishery. However, our results show that lifting the doors and consequently the sweeps can lead to substantial catch losses.

Studies in the Baltic Sea have shown that this could be achieved by implementing alternative fishing methods, e.g. by using fish pots instead of lines or gillnets. However, as in net and line fisheries, a pot fishery could also result in bycatch of seals. In order to prevent these bycatches, pot entrances were equipped with seal exclusion devices (SEDs) of various sizes and shapes. A field study was conducted to investigate what effect different types of SEDs had on the bycatch of seals as well as on the pot's catchability. When pots where equipped with SEDs the bycatch of seals was reduced to zero without negatively affecting the pot's catchability. The shape and size of the entrance did have a significant effect on the pot's catchability and the size of the fish. Using symmetrical oval shaped entrances along with larger rectangular entrances divided into two smaller openings increased the pot's catchability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The availability of long-term datasets on fish yields (1950-1974 and 1996-2011), with information related to the seawater temperatures and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), has allowed us to study the qualitative and quantitative changes in fish yields in the last decade and the possible relationships with the seasonal anomalies of temperature that have occurred in the Ligurian Sea. In 1950-1974, yields remained relatively constant over time (average of 35.6 +/- 8.7tyear(-1)). From 1996 through 2011, yields were high (42.9 +/- 15.9t.year(-1)) but inconsistent with strong annual variability in catches. The primary catches are Seriola dumerili, Auxis rochei, Trachurus spp. and Sarda sarda. Changes in species composition have occurred as well: S.dumerili, Sardinella sp. and Belone belone have appeared recently. Moreover, a significant decrease in the boreal scombroid (Scomber scombrus) and an increase of warm-temperate carangids and other typically Southern Mediterranean species such as Coryphaena hippurus and Sphyraena viridensis, appear to be linked to the warming of the surface water layer, particularly evident in the Ligurian Sea, for the last 10years. The analysis of this kind of trend may be a powerful tool for assessing structural changes of the pelagic fish community in the Ligurian Sea (Northwestern Mediterranean).;"[Cattaneo-Vietti, Riccardo] Univ Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Sci Vita & Ambiente DISVA, I-60121 Ancona, Italy; [Cappanera, Valentina] Santa Margherita Ligure, Portofino Marine Protected Area, Genoa, Italy; [Castellano, Michela; Povero, Paolo] Univ Genoa, Dipartimento Sci Terra Ambiente & Vita DISTAV, Genoa, Italy";;Cattaneo-Vietti, R (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Sci Mare, Via Brecce Bianche, I-60121 Ancona, Italy.;catta@unige.it;;;;;44;12;12;0;16;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0173-9565;1439-0485;MAR ECOL-EVOL PERSP;Mar.

To mitigate this situation, cod pots were evaluated as an alternative to traditional gillnets and longlines. During a 3-year study, cod pots were used by commercial fishers in two areas off the coast of Sweden. Using the data from this study, we evaluated catches from pots in relation to other gear types and investigated the effects of environmental and fisheries-related variables such as depth and soak time. The comparison of pots with other gear types showed that, during the first half of the year, the pot fishery generated lower daily catches than the gillnet and longline fisheries at comparable fishing efforts. During the second half of the year, catches in the pot fishery exceeded or were equal to those in the traditional fisheries. Using generalized additive models to evaluate the impact of environmental and fisheries-related variables on pot catches, we showed that, in both areas, the catch per unit effort (cpue) of legal-sized cod was affected by the water depth, the time of year (months), and the soak time. In one of the areas, cpue was also affected by the direction of the water current in relation to the orientation of the string of pots. The cpue of undersized cod was affected by topographic variables such as the slope and the complexity of the bottom, in addition to the water depth, month of the year, and soak time. The results from the study indicate that pots can be a useful alternative gear in the Baltic cod fishery, at least during part of the year. By using our information on how catches are affected by environmental and fisheries-related variables, the pot fishery may be further optimized to increase catches.;"[Konigson, Sara J.; Lunneryd, Sven-Gunnar] SLU Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Inst Coastal Res, Dept Aquat Resources, S-45321 Lysekil, Sweden; [Fredriksson, Ronny E.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquat Resources, S-38696 Farjestaden, Sweden; [Stromberg, Patrick] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Oceanog Lab, Vastra Frolunda, Sweden; [Bergstrom, Ulf M.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Inst Coastal Res, Dept Aquat Resources, S-74243 Oregrund, Sweden";;Konigson, SJ (corresponding author), SLU Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Inst Coastal Res, Dept Aquat Resources, Turistgatan 5, S-45321 Lysekil, Sweden.;sara.konigson@slu.se;;Bergstrom, Ulf/0000-0002-5478-0634;"Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA); Swedish Board of Fisheries; Swedish Agency for Marine and Water management through the 'Seals and Fisheries' Programme";Thanks to all fishers participating in the project and thereby being the pioneers of the cod pot fisheries in Sweden: Per Mansson, Goran, and Kurt Olofsson.

Given the lack of knowledge on the impacts of fisheries on this species, a demographic analysis using age-based Leslie matrices was carried out. Given the uncertainties in the mortality estimates and in the available life history parameters, several different scenarios, some incorporating stochasticity in the life history parameters (using Monte Carlo simulation), were analyzed. If only natural mortality were considered, even after introducing uncertainties in all parameters, the estimated population growth rate (A) suggested an increasing population. However, if fishing mortality from trawl fisheries is considered, the estimates of A either indicated increasing or declining populations. In these latter cases, the uncertainties in the species reproductive cycle seemed to be particularly relevant, as a 2-year reproductive cycle indicated a stable population, while a longer (3-year cycle) indicated a declining population. The estimated matrix elasticities were in general higher for the survivorship parameters of the younger age classes and tended to decrease for the older ages. This highlights the susceptibility of this deep-sea squaloid to increasing fishing mortality, emphasizing that even though this is a small-sized species, it shows population dynamics patterns more typical of the larger-sized and in general more vulnerable species.

This work was conducted to evaluate the consequences of inserting either a 40-mm square-mesh or a 50-mm diamond-mesh (instead of the traditional 40-mm diamond-mesh) at codends in commercial Spanish trawlers. Landings in terms of biomass, income and catch composition were compared under commercial conditions. Four metiers were identified in the fishery: European hake (Merluccius merluccius), red mullet (Mullus barbatus), red shrimp (Aristeus antennatus) and Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus). No significant differences were observed in biomass or income owing to the new mesh in either European hake or red mullet. In contrast, the total biomass of the red shrimp metier and the biomass of the Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus, were significantly higher after the selectivity change. Regarding the catch composition, only the European hake metier showed slight - but not significant - changes after using the new mesh. Considering these results, there was no short-term effect (substantial biological or economic loss) as previous studies had expected. This could possibly be related to a higher performance of the new gear that may compensate for the lower retention of small sizes.;"[Samy-Kamal, M.; Forcada, A.; Sanchez Lizaso, J.

This fishery is experiencing a long period of crisis due to resource depletion and the lack of appropriate market strategies, and vessels spend most of the time searching for fishing schools. The searching strategy largely depends on the interaction between vessels: the captains of the PTM units take their decision also checking the position and the fishing status of other vessels. Understanding this strategy represents a key step towards a more effective resource management, since strategies directly determine the pattern of fishing effort. A Conditional Logit model has been devised to analyze fishermen's strategy as a non-cooperative game. This category of games is characterized by the existence of (at least) one equilibrium point - a Nash Equilibrium - in which each player plays his strategy, that is a Best Response to the strategies of the other players. This equilibrium point was estimated for the different scenarios defined by environmental (sea surface temperature and atmospheric pressure) and economic (fuel and fish prices at market) variables. Vessel Monitoring System data were used to capture fleet activity, while different datasets were collected to reconstruct environmental and economic drivers. Results indicate a good predictive power of the model, and suggest that the equilibrium strategy that guides units' behaviour is invariant with respect to environmental conditions, whereas it is largely influenced by economic factors. These latter, via strategies, may determine important consequences on the resources in terms of exploited areas and the impact of fishing activity. In particular, a low fuel price when fish price is high leads to higher values of CPUE, and then to a more efficient but also impacting fishing activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The reduction in juvenile mortality is particularly relevant in the Mediterranean and is considered as one of the main prerequisites for the future sustainability of trawl fisheries. The distribution of nursery areas of 11 important commercial species of demersal fish and shellfish was analysed in the European Union Mediterranean waters using time series of bottom trawl survey data with the aim of identifying the most persistent recruitment areas. A high interspecific spatial overlap between nursery areas was mainly found along the shelf break of many different sectors of the Northern Mediterranean indicating a high potential for the implementation of conservation measures. Overlap of the nursery grounds with existing spatial fisheries management measures and trawl fisheries restricted areas was also investigated. Spatial analyses revealed considerable variation depending on species and associated habitat/depth preferences with increased protection seen in coastal nurseries and minimal protection seen for deeper nurseries (e.g. Parapenaeus longirostris 6%). This is partly attributed to existing environmental policy instruments (e.g. Habitats Directive and Mediterranean Regulation EC 1967/2006) aiming at minimising impacts on coastal priority habitats such as seagrass, coralligenous and maerl beds. The new knowledge on the distribution and persistence of demersal nurseries provided in this study can support the application of spatial conservation measures, such as the designation of no-take Marine Protected Areas in EU Mediterranean waters and their inclusion in a conservation network. The establishment of no-take zones will be consistent with the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy applying the ecosystem approach to fisheries management and with the requirements of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive to maintain or achieve seafloor integrity and good environmental status.;"[Colloca, Francesco; Garofalo, Germana; Fiorentino, Fabio] CNR, IAMC, Mazara Del Vallo, Italy; [Bitetto, Isabella; Facchini, Maria Teresa; Martiradonna, Angela; Lembo, Giuseppe; Spedicato, Maria Teresa] COISPA Tecnol & Ric, Bari, Italy; [Grati, Fabio; Scarcella, Giuseppe] CNR, Ist Sci Marine ISMAR, Ancona, Italy; [Mastrantonio, Gianluca] Univ Rome Tre, Dept Econ, I-00146 Rome, Italy; [Nikolioudakis, Nikolaos; Tserpes, George; Valavanis, Vasilis; Lefkaditou, Eugenia; Papadopoulou, Nadia; Smith, Christopher J.] Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Iraklion, Greece; [Ordinas, Francesc; Pilar Tugores, M.; Iglesias, Magdalena; Massuti, Enric] Ctr Oceanog Balears, Inst Espanol Oceanog, Palma De Mallorca, Spain; [Carlucci, Roberto] Univ Bari, Dept Biol, Bari, Italy; [Follesa, Maria C.] Univ Cagliari, Dept Life & Environm Sci, Cagliari, Italy; [Knittweis, Leyla] Univ Malta, Dept Biol, Msida, Malta; [Manfredi, Chiara] Univ Bologna, Lab Biol Marina Fano, Bologna, Italy; [Pace, Marie Louise] Minist Sustainable Dev Environm & Climate Change, Dept Fisheries & Aquaculture, Santa Venera, Malta; [Sartor, Paolo] Ctr Interuniv Biol Marina & Ecol Applicata G Bacc, Livorno, Italy";;Colloca, F (corresponding author), CNR, IAMC, Mazara Del Vallo, Italy.;francesco.colloca@iamc.cnr.it;"Fiorentino, Fabio/AAX-2883-2020; Carlucci, Roberto/ABC-7196-2020; Ordinas, Francesc/AAG-7079-2021; Nikolioudakis, Nikolaos/A-9986-2013; Grati, Fabio/AAT-4760-2020; Scarcella, Giuseppe/AAW-3850-2020; Tugores, M.P./AAE-5569-2020; mastrantonio, gianluca/ABE-5936-2021; Isajlovic, Igor/AAP-9861-2020; Valavanis, Vasilis D/G-8869-2011; Carlucci, Roberto/C-5728-2009; Massuti, Enric/AAG-5117-2021; Tserpes, George/L-6201-2013";"Carlucci, Roberto/0000-0002-9287-6936; Nikolioudakis, Nikolaos/0000-0002-5029-5164; Tugores, M.P./0000-0003-2923-3038; mastrantonio, gianluca/0000-0002-2963-6729; Valavanis, Vasilis D/0000-0001-6288-6044; Tserpes, George/0000-0001-9052-4091; Smith, Christopher/0000-0002-3031-5316; Knittweis-Mifsud, Leyla/0000-0001-9023-2750; GRATI, FABIO/0000-0002-1793-303X; Lefkaditou, Evgenia/0000-0002-7868-5375; Papadopoulou, Nadia/0000-0003-4767-9949; Ordines, F.

In addition to a standard boxcorer for common macrofauna, a Triple-D dredge was used to collect longer-lived, more sparsely distributed infauna and epifauna. Multivariate analysis did not reveal any difference between the assemblages in and outside OWEZ with respect to abundance, biomass, and production after a 5-year closure. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index pointed to a significantly higher diversity in OWEZ compared with some of the reference areas. A minority of the bivalve species assumed to be sensitive to trawling showed higher abundances (Spisula solida) or larger sizes (Tellina fabula, Ensis directus) in OWEZ than in some of the reference areas. In general, samples collected with the Triple-D showed more differences between areas than boxcore samples. No evidence was also found that the species composition in OWEZ relative to the reference areas had changed in the period between 1 (2007) and 5 (2011) years after closure. The change observed in all areas between 2007 and 2011 was mainly due to relatively small variations in species abundances. In conclusion, 5 years after the closure of OWEZ to fisheries, only subtle changes were measured in the local benthic community, i.e. a higher species diversity and an increased abundance and lengths of some bivalves. Depleted adult stocks, faunal patchiness, and a limited time for recovery (5 years) might explain that a significant recovery could not be found. The current study shows that designation of large-scale marine protected areas as planned for the North Sea will not automatically imply that restoration of benthic assemblages can be expected within a relatively short period of years.;"[Bergman, Magda J.

Several studies have assessed trawling at fine spatial scales yearly, largely ignoring temporal patterns. In this study, we analysed these temporal patterns in beam trawl effort intensity at 90 stations of the Dutch continental shelf of the North Sea for a period of 10 years, at a fine temporal (weekly) and spatial (110 x 70 m) scale using Vessel Monitoring by Satellite (VMS) data. Our results show that trawling is aggregated in time and shows clear seasonality, related to the behavior of the fleet and migration patterns of the target fish species. The temporal patterns affect the overall impact on and the recovery of the benthic community, as is illustrated with a benthic population model. Our results imply that trawling impact studies using high-resolution data like VMS should take account of the possibility of temporal aggregation and seasonality in trawling to improve the assessment of the impact of trawling on the population dynamics of benthos.;"[van denderen, P.

These changes may negatively affect prey availability for demersal fishes, potentially leading to reduced food intake, body condition and yield of fishes in chronically trawled areas. Here, the effect of trawling on the prey availability and diet of two commercially important flatfish species, plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and dab (Limanda limanda), was investigated over a trawling intensity gradient in the Irish Sea. Previous work in this area has shown that trawling negatively affects the condition of plaice but not of dab. This study showed that reductions in local prey availability did not result in reduced feeding of fish. As trawling frequency increased, both fish and prey biomass declined, such that the ratio of fish to prey remained unchanged. Consequently, even at frequently trawled sites with low prey biomass, both plaice and dab maintained constant levels of stomach fullness and gut energy contents. However, dietary shifts in plaice towards energy-poor prey items were evident when prey species were analysed individually. This, together with a potential decrease in foraging efficiency due to low prey densities, was seen as the most plausible cause for the reduced body condition observed. Understanding the relationship between trawling, benthic impacts, fish foraging and resultant body condition is an important step in designing successful mitigation measures for future management strategies in bottom trawl fisheries.;"[Johnson, Andrew Frederick; Gorelli, Giulia; Jenkins, Stuart Rees; Hiddink, Jan Geert; Hinz, Hilmar] Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Anglesey, Wales";;Johnson, AF (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Marine Biodivers & Conservat, Scripps Inst Oceanog 0202, 9500 Gilman Dr, San Diego, CA 92083 USA.;afjohnson@ucsd.edu;"Hinz, Hilmar/AAH-7148-2019; Jenkins, Stuart R/D-2032-2010; Hiddink, Jan Geert/C-1238-2009";"Hinz, Hilmar/0000-0003-4909-0089; Jenkins, Stuart R/0000-0002-2299-6318; Hiddink, Jan Geert/0000-0001-7114-830X";"Natural Environment Research Council (UK)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); EUEuropean Commission [312088]";A.F.J. was funded by a PhD studentship from the Natural Environment Research Council (UK) and J.G.H. was partly supported by the EU FP7 funded project BENTHIS, grant no. 312088.;52;29;29;2;42;ROYAL SOC;LONDON;6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND;0962-8452;1471-2954;P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI;Proc.

Based on the results, we were able to explain why the BACOMA codend, applied in the Baltic Sea cod directed trawl fishery, releases juvenile cod efficiently, whereas other designs, including a square mesh panel with similar mesh size, are less efficient. Our main findings reveal that the release efficiency of the square mesh panel in the BACOMA codend depends largely on the overlap of the square mesh panel and the catch-accumulation zone in the codend, where cod do not have the option of just drifting further back in the trawl when proximate to the panel. On the contrary, the reduction in panel size by 50% did not significantly affect the release efficiency when the panel overlapped with the catch-accumulation zone. It was possible to stimulate an escape response for cod to achieve a release through a square mesh panel positioned away from the catch-accumulation zone. Our findings demonstrated that this release was as efficient as for a panel mounted in the catch-accumulation zone of the codend. Devices that stimulate behaviour may improve the release efficiency of cod through square mesh panels in other fisheries where this is a problem.;"[Herrmann, Bent] SINTEF Fisheries & Aquaculture, DK-9850 Hirtshals, Denmark; [Wienbeck, Harald; Dahm, Erdmann] Thunen Inst Balt Sea Fisheries, D-22767 Hamburg, Germany; [Karlsen, Junita Diana] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, DK-9850 Hirtshals, Denmark; [Stepputtis, Daniel] Thunen Inst Balt Sea Fisheries, D-18069 Rostock, Germany; [Moderhak, Waldemar] Sea Fisheries Inst Gdynia, Morski Inst Rybacki Gdyni, PL-81332 Gdynia, Poland";;Herrmann, B (corresponding author), SINTEF Fisheries & Aquaculture, North Sea Sci Pk, DK-9850 Hirtshals, Denmark.;bent.herrmann@sintef.no;;"Karlsen, Junita Diana/0000-0002-0496-4638; Herrmann, Bent/0000-0003-1325-6198; Stepputtis, Daniel/0000-0003-4824-1631";;;37;38;38;0;9;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;1054-3139;1095-9289;ICES J MAR SCI;ICES J.

Using the proportion of sites occupied by a species is misleading, however, if surveys routinely fail to detect species that are present. We used chevron traps paired with underwater videos (N = 1555) in a binomial (presence-absence) generalized additive modeling framework to quantify how environmental conditions, habitat characteristics, and the number of individuals at each site (i.e. site abundance) influenced the detection probabilities of economically important reef fish species in the southeastern USA. After accounting for variable site abundance, trap detection probabilities declined 40% for red porgy Pagrus pagrus, 65% for gray triggerfish Balistes capriscus, and 75% for vermilion snapper Rhomboplites aurorubens as percent hard bottom increased from 0 to 100%. Increasing water temperature caused red porgy trap detection probability to decline modestly, while for gray triggerfish and vermilion snapper it increased substantially. Underwater video was more likely to detect black sea bass Centropristis striata, red porgy, and gray triggerfish when site abundance and water clarity were high and the video camera was facing downcurrent. Using multiple gears simultaneously, we quantified the ways in which predictor variables influenced the sampling process, which will help in designing surveys that maximize detection probability. Our results also suggest that pairing video cameras to trawls, fisheries acoustics, or nets allows for the estimation of detection probabilities.;"[Bacheler, Nathan M.; Berrane, David J.; Mitchell, Warren A.; Schobernd, Christina M.; Schobernd, Zebulon H.; Teer, Bradford Z.] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA; [Ballenger, Joseph C.] Marine Resources Res Inst, South Carolina Dept Nat Resources, Charleston, SC 29412 USA";;Bacheler, NM (corresponding author), Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, 101 Pivers Isl Rd, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA.;nate.bacheler@noaa.gov;"Ballenger, Joseph/O-7078-2018; Schobernd, Zeb/V-4379-2019";Ballenger, Joseph/0000-0003-4785-4698;;;45;32;33;3;41;INTER-RESEARCH;OLDENDORF LUHE;NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY;0171-8630;1616-1599;MAR ECOL PROG SER;Mar.

One component of the survey is mapping the upper pelagic zone using a trawl towed at several depths. However, the current technique with a single codend does not provide fine-scale spatial data needed to directly study species overlaps. An in-trawl camera system, Deep Vision, was mounted in front of the codend in order to acquire continuous images of all organisms passing. It was possible to identify and quantify of most young-of-the-year fish (e.g. Gadus morhua, Boreogadus saida and Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) and zooplankton, including Ctenophora, which are usually damaged in the codend. The system showed potential for measuring the length of small organisms and also recorded the vertical and horizontal positions where individuals were imaged. Young-of-the-year fish were difficult to identify when passing the camera at maximum range and to quantify during high densities. In addition, a large number of fish with damaged opercula were observed passing the Deep Vision camera during heaving; suggesting individuals had become entangled in meshes farther forward in the trawl. This indicates that unknown numbers of fish are probably lost in forward sections of the trawl and that the heaving procedure may influence the number of fish entering the codend, with implications for abundance indices and understanding population dynamics. This study suggests modifications to the Deep Vision and the trawl to increase our understanding of the population dynamics.";"[Underwood, Melanie J.; Rosen, Shale; Engas, Arill; Eriksen, Elena] Inst Marine Res, N-5024 Bergen, Norway; [Underwood, Melanie J.; Engas, Arill] Univ Bergen, Dept Biol, Bergen, Norway";;Underwood, MJ (corresponding author), Inst Marine Res, POB 1870, N-5024 Bergen, Norway.;melanie.underwood@imr.no;Rosen, Shale/E-9444-2017;"Rosen, Shale/0000-0002-5857-1637; Underwood, Melanie/0000-0002-7752-5548";Barents Sea Research programme at the Institute of Marine Research and Scantrol AS;The authors would like to acknowledge support provided by the Barents Sea Research programme at the Institute of Marine Research and Scantrol AS.

A good correlation is found between the rises in the surrounding surface vorticity and the drops in the CPUE of the adult red shrimp. This correlation could be explained by assuming that most of the surface vorticity episodes could reach the bottom, increasing the seabed velocities and producing sediment resuspension, which could affect the near bottom water turbidity. A. antennatus would respond to this increased turbidity disappearing from the fishing grounds, probably moving downwards to the deeper waters. This massive displacement of red shrimp specimens away from the fishing grounds would consequently decrease their accessibility to fishing exploitation. Similar although more intense responses have been observed during the downslope shelf dense water current episodes that occurred in a submarine canyon, northeast of the Iberian peninsula. The proposed mechanism suggesting how the surface vorticity observed can affect the bottom sediments is investigated using a year-long moored near-bottom current meter and a sediment trap moored near the fishing grounds. The relationship between vorticity and catches is also explored for fish species (Galeus melastomus, Micromesistius poutassou, Phycis blennoides) and other crustacean (Geryon longipes and Nephrops norvegicus), considered as by-catch of the deep water fishery in the area. Results appear to support the suggestion that the water turbidity generated by the vorticity episodes is significant enough to affect the dynamics of the demersal species. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In total, 27 species, belonging to 4 taxonomic groups (24 fish, 1 gastropod, 1 bivalve and 1 crustacean) were obtained. The percentage distribution of the total catch was 8.32% target species, 14.59% non-target landing and 77.09% discard. The discard rate of Mullus barbatus in the total catch was 0.61%. Among the total catch, Brachyura (22.74%) was the main group discarded, while the other important discard species were Rapana venosa (16.90%), Scorpaena porcus (13.71%) and Uranoscopus scaber (9.65%). The lowest and highest discard rates were found in spring and autumn, respectively. According to depth, the lowest discard rate was from depths > 30 m (37.5%) and the highest at depths < 16 m (91.8%). Regarding the mesh size, minimum and maximum discard rates were obtained from 16 and 22 mm mesh sizes, respectively. According to one-way analysis of similarity (ANOSIM), there was a significant difference in discard species composition between spring and summer and between the < 16 m and > 30 m depth groups (P < 0.05).

The estimated CBD population along the Israeli coastline consumes roughly 1280 t of prey annually, similar to the mean annual trawl-fishery yield of 1300 t. In the ultra-oligotrophic Levantine Basin, the potential for competition for limited resources therefore exists. We aimed to examine whether the two consumers indeed harvest the same trophic level of the food web and the same members of that level. These questions were addressed by stomach content and stable isotope (delta N-15 and delta C-13) analyses. The database included 26 prey-containing stomachs collected between 1996 and 2008 and muscle tissue samples of 23 dolphins and of 27 species of commercial fish and invertebrates for stable isotopes analysis. The 59.3 kg combined stomach content included at least 754 prey items, 97.3% of which were fish, belonging to 22 identified species. About half (46.4%) of the prey mass had medium-to-high commercial value. The overall similarity of the composition of the pooled biomass and that of the average commercial catch was expressed by a Pianka index of 0.49. Sparidae (sea bream) was the only family important for both consumers. The mean delta N-15 value of CBD muscle was found to be relatively low compared to other geographical areas and the estimated mean delta N-15 of its diet fell below that of most commercial species tested. Our findings suggest that CBD and the fisheries only partly share resources, with CBD having an overall minor effect on the bottom trawl fishery, mainly on the Sparidae catch.;"[Scheinin, A.

Hooking in gills and aorta increased bleeding severity, which was generally expressed more strongly in larger pike. Our results supported the notion that anglers can minimize injury in northern pike angling by the choice of appropriate gear. In addition, our study is one of the first to show that hooking location is also affected by water temperature; low temperatures tended to result in deeper hooking.

Combining a discard ban with catch quotas, where all fish, independent of size, count towards quotas could create economic incentives for more selective fishing, reducing unwanted catches. We use fishing activities data from English North Sea otter trawlers to examine the impact of these measures on this fleet. Initial impacts depend on the scale of increase and distribution of quotas and are unevenly distributed, depending on catch and discard characteristics of vessels. Selective fishing will be rewarded as vessels that currently have low discards could increase catches and profits. Fishing by less selective vessels will be curtailed, reducing profits by 1-14%. This could be partially mitigated through reducing regulated catches but will require changes to fishing patterns as using currently available selective fishing gears may impact on profitability. So, catch quotas and a discard ban create strong incentives for more selective fishing practices, but also for non-compliance with full documentation of catches. A high level of monitoring and enforcement will be required to ensure that fishers improve profitability through more selective fishing practices rather than illegal discarding.;"[Condie, Harriet M.; Grant, Alastair] Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Catchpole, Thomas L.] CEFAS Lowestoft, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England";;Condie, HM (corresponding author), Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.;h.condie@uea.ac.uk;Grant, Alastair/L-7301-2018;Grant, Alastair/0000-0002-1147-2375;DEFRADepartment for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA);We would like to thank DEFRA for the funding of this project.;24;20;20;0;29;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;1054-3139;1095-9289;ICES J MAR SCI;ICES J.

Historical records of this fishing practice date back to the mid-1300s. Trawling became a widespread practice in the late 19th century, and it is now progressively expanding to greater depths, with the concerns about its sustainability that emerged during the first half of the 20th century now increasing. We show here that compared with untrawled areas, chronically trawled sediments along the continental slope of the north-western Mediterranean Sea are characterized by significant decreases in organic matter content (up to 52%), slower organic carbon turnover (ca. 37%), and reduced meiofauna abundance (80%), biodiversity (50%), and nematode species richness (25%). We estimate that the organic carbon removed daily by trawling in the region under scrutiny represents as much as 60-100% of the input flux. We anticipate that such an impact is causing the degradation of deep-sea sedimentary habitats and an infaunal depauperation. With deep-sea trawling currently conducted along most continental margins, we conclude that trawling represents a major threat to the deep seafloor ecosystem at the global scale.;"[Pusceddu, Antonio; Bianchelli, Silvia; Danovaro, Roberto] Polytech Univ Marche, Dept Life & Environm Sci, I-60131 Ancona, Italy; [Martin, Jacobo; Puig, Pere; Palanques, Albert] CSIC, Dept Marine Geosci, Inst Ciencias Mar, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain; [Martin, Jacobo] Ctr Austral Invest Cient, RA-9410 Ushuaia, Argentina; [Masque, Pere] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Fis, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Masque, Pere] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Danovaro, Roberto] Stn Zool A Dohrn, I-80121 Naples, Italy";;Pusceddu, A (corresponding author), Polytech Univ Marche, Dept Life & Environm Sci, I-60131 Ancona, Italy.;a.pusceddu@univpm.it;"Masque, Pere/N-1424-2019; Bianchelli, Silvia/F-3954-2018; Puig, Pere/E-5422-2013; Palanques, Albert/C-2661-2013; Martin, Jacobo/F-1388-2011; Masque, Pere/B-7379-2008";"Masque, Pere/0000-0002-1789-320X; Bianchelli, Silvia/0000-0002-1957-3269; Puig, Pere/0000-0001-6189-5504; Martin, Jacobo/0000-0001-8933-7731; Masque, Pere/0000-0002-1789-320X; Palanques, Albert/0000-0003-2544-2342";"ECEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [226354]; Spanish Research Plan [CTM2010-11084-E]; Government of Catalonia through the Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats Academia prize; Project Ricerca Italiana per il Mare; Junta para la Ampliacion de Estudios, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient ficas and European Social Fund";Assistance at sea by the crews of research vessel Garc a del Cid is acknowledged.

Fishery management measures in this area include a trawling period of 8 months per year (October to May). Macrofauna samples were collected before and after 30 and 120 days of the commencement of the trawling period (temporal axis) along a southward transect (spatial axis) and down through the sediment profile (vertical axis). Results: Main results revealed no recognizable changes in community diversity and structure at temporal scales. This finding can probably be attributed to the fact that the examined communities are subjected to continuous disturbances deriving from multiple natural and anthropogenic stressors acting simultaneously in Thermaikos Gulf. Molluscan assemblages were already stressed before the commencement of the trawling period, indicating that the time period in which bottom trawling is prohibited is not sufficient for the recovery of benthic communities. Significant shifts in the trophic structure of molluscan assemblages were also detected. The direct mortality of herbivorous species and the loss of filter feeding organisms may be attributed to the passage of the fishing gear and to sediment re-suspension, respectively. Trawling disturbance may have created the observed vertical patterns of the community structure since hauling induces profound changes in the geochemical profile of the sediment. Conclusions: Our findings sustained the notion that bottom trawling, alongside with other types of human induced stressors, can have considerable effects on the structure and function of the benthic domain. Therefore, our results highlighted the need of an Ecosystem Based Fishery Management (EBFM) perspective in Thermaikos Gulf to ensure both fisheries and ecosystem sustainability.;"[Dimitriadis, Charalampos; Koutsoubas, Drosos; Garyfalou, Zoi] Univ Aegean, Fac Environm, Dept Marine Sci, Mytilene Lesvos Isl 81000, Greece; [Tselepides, Anastasios] Univ Piraeus, Dept Maritime Studies, Piraeus 18534, Greece; [Dimitriadis, Charalampos; Koutsoubas, Drosos] Natl Marine Pk Zakynthos, Zakynthos Isl 29100, Greece";;Dimitriadis, C (corresponding author), Univ Aegean, Fac Environm, Dept Marine Sci, Mytilene Lesvos Isl 81000, Greece.;xdimitriadis@marine.aegean.gr;"Dimitriadis, Charalampos/AAF-6504-2020; Tselepides, Anastasios/AAO-3965-2021";"Dimitriadis, Charalampos/0000-0002-8381-4362; Tselepides, Anastasios/0000-0002-7880-9091";"Commission of the European Communities (DG-XII) through the INTERPOL project (Impact of Natural and Trawling Events on Resuspension, Dispersion and Fate of Pollutants) [EVK3-2000-00023]; Greek Ministry of Development (General Secretariat for Research and Technology)Greek Ministry of Development-GSRT";The authors would like to thank the officers and crew of the R/V's AEGAEO and PHILIA for their assistance during field work.

While 82.02% of the total catch had commercial value, 17.98% was discarded. The percentage of the discarded red mullet and whiting under MLS (<13 cm) were found to be 16.03% and 13.27%, respectively. The highest discard amount was observed in winter and the lowest one in summer. The discard rate was highest in the 55-74 m depth group and the 32 mm mesh size. One-way analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) showed that there were significant differences in the discard species compositions between spring and summer, as well as 32 and 40 mm, 32 and 44 mm mesh sizes (P<0.05).

Three main trawling fisheries were identified, i.e. the international flatfish fisheries comprising the effort of steam trawlers and motor cutters, the German shrimp fisheries and the industrial inshore fisheries. Except for shrimp trawling, which was performed by beam trawling with one beam per vessel, all historical trawling effort was identified as otter board trawling. The trawling effort increased from 1,131,000 to 1,232,000 h in 1924 to 3,170,000 to 3,836,000 h in 1937 and declined in 1938. The main fishery effort was contributed by the German shrimp fisheries, accounting for a maximum of 2,140,000 h in 1937. In comparison, in 2006, approximately 540,000 h were spent fishing in the trawl fisheries of the study area, comprising effort from small (<= 221 kW) to large beam trawlers (>221 kW), shrimp fisheries and otter board trawling. The bulk of the historical effort was concentrated at water depths of 5-20 m. With the implementation of combustion engines and new gear technology, the period of 1924-1938 marked a new era for marine fishing when virtually all space became accessible and, in particular, the trawling of inshore areas increased.

Fourteen vessels fished a total of 168 days in the North Sea in 1997. In the wreck fishery the total effort was 1052 nets with active pingers, 1056 nets with dummy pingers and 74 nets without pingers. Eight porpoises were caught, all in nets with dummy pingers. In the flat bottom/stony ground fishery the total effort was 5596 nets with active pingers, 5210 nets with dummy pingers and 2973 nets without pingers. Sixteen porpoises were caught, including 1 animal in a net with active pingers, 6 in nets with dummy pingers and 9 in nets without pingers. The difference in bycatch between nets with active pingers and nets with inactive or no pingers was highly significant (p < 0.007) for both the wreck fishery and the flat bottom/stony ground fishery. We conclude that the direct effects of the pinger signals on the porpoises caused the reduction in bycatch, which means that the results can be generalized to other situations where harbour porpoises are taken in gillnets. Generalized linear modelling demonstrated that cod cpue was not affected negatively by pingers. It was furthermore estimated that the stony ground fishery had significantly lower (p < 0.001) cpue values (a factor 0.47) compared to the wreck fishery. The results of this experiment led to the introduction of pingers in Danish gillnet fisheries in 2001 and were also part of the basis for EU Council Regulation 812/2004 introducing EU-wide use of pingers.

Monthly samples of silver roughy were sampled from the catches of four commercial trawlers in 2004. Each trawler operated in different fishing grounds (FGs), located off Northern Tunisia, South of Sicily, Malta Islands and in South Levant, for which different exploitation levels are reported. The overall length-frequency distribution (LFD) was constructed, and fishing impact indices (length as percentage of LFD, optimum and maximum length, percentage of mega-spawners and total mortality/von Bertalanffy curvature ratio) were calculated. In spite of an overall acceptable status (juveniles, matures and mega-spawners were present in the catch), sampling data revealed significant differences in LFD shape and status indices between FGs. Those FGs traditionally considered more exploited (Northern Tunisia and South of Sicily) showed a dominance of juveniles, a rarefaction of mega-spawners, a reduction in maximum and asymptotic length and a higher Z/K ratio. Considering the general homogeneity of Mediterranean deep-water habitats, the pelagic dispersal of eggs and the poor swimming capabilities of silver roughy, the present results indicated that deep-water trawling may induce a slow and subtle, although significant, erosion of the older, late maturing and slow growing component of the stocks in the Mediterranean (so-called longevity-overfishing).;"[Vitale, S.; Ragonese, S.; Fiorentino, F.; Mazzola, S.] Natl Res Council IAMC CNR, Inst Marine & Coastal Environm, I-91026 Mazara Del Vallo, Italy; [Cannizzaro, L.] Natl Res Council IAMC CNR, Inst Marine & Coastal Environm, I-91021 Campobello Di Mazara, Italy";;Vitale, S (corresponding author), Natl Res Council IAMC CNR, Inst Marine & Coastal Environm, Via L Vaccara 61, I-91026 Mazara Del Vallo, Italy.;sergio.vitale@cnr.it;"Vitale, Sergio/AAX-5418-2020; Fiorentino, Fabio/AAX-2883-2020; Cannizzaro, Leonardo/AAE-5620-2020";"vitale, sergio/0000-0001-6063-4126; Mazzola, Salvatore/0000-0002-4622-8129";;;62;3;3;0;17;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;NEW YORK;32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA;0025-3154;1469-7769;J MAR BIOL ASSOC UK;J.

The aim of this study is to analyze environmental fluctuations through time of a demersal species, European hake (Merluccius merluccius), caught by Basque bottom trawlers in European waters. The three-step LCA+DEA method, which combines LCA with data envelopment analysis (DEA), a linear programming tool, was implemented to assess annual variability of the environmental impacts in the period 2001-2006. The identification of the varying operational efficiency levels between vessels and the potential environmental gains of input minimization were explored. Results showed variations of up to 25% in the environmental impacts between years, although minimal environmental gains were identified through operational benchmarking, given the similar efficiency values between vessels. Hence, it was observed that despite substantial interannual changes in the impacts, there is limited potential for environmental impact reduction for the assessed environmental dimensions. Environmental and operational differences between years impeded setting a particular best-performing target for this production system, attributable to the high variance observed in input/output distribution through time. Finally, results seem to confirm the lower fluctuations in environmental impacts for demersal species fishing in comparison with those of small pelagic fish.;"[Ramos, Saioa; Zufia, Jaime] AZTI Tecnalia, Food Res Div, Derio 48160, Spain; [Vazquez-Rowe, Ian; Teresa Moreira, Maria] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Chem Engn, Sch Engn, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain; [Artetxe, Inaki] AZTI Tecnalia, Div Marine Res, Sukarrieta 48395, Spain";;Ramos, S (corresponding author), AZTI Tecnalia, Food Res Div, Derio 48160, Spain.;sramos@azti.es;Feijoo, Gumersindo/I-3126-2015;"Moreira, Maria Teresa/0000-0001-9354-3298; Ramos, Saioa/0000-0002-9517-5692; Feijoo, Gumersindo/0000-0001-6231-3887; Vazquez-Rowe, Ian/0000-0002-7469-2033; Artetxe, Inaki/0000-0003-4031-1113";"Inaki Goenaga (FCT-IG) Technology Centres Foundation; Xunta de GaliciaXunta de GaliciaEuropean Commission; Galician Government [GRC 2010/37]";Saioa Ramos wishes to thank the Inaki Goenaga (FCT-IG) Technology Centres Foundation for financial support.

Mitigating the Impact of an Artisanal Fishery on Cuttlefish Offspring;PLOS ONE;English;Article;;;;;;;"NORTHERN ADRIATIC SEA; SEPIA-OFFICINALIS L.; EGGS; CEPHALOPODA; TRENDS";Background: Overexploitation and the impact of several types of human activities have caused declines of marine resources. The direct and active involvement of fishermen in the management of marine resources is effective not only for resource conservation, but also for changing fishermen's attitudes. In this study, we proposed and tested the efficacy and suitability of a measure for mitigating the impact of a trap fishery on cuttlefish eggs in the North Adriatic Sea. This measure directly involves fishermen in promoting the conservation of the early, and more vulnerable, stages of the cuttlefish life cycle. Methodology/Principal findings: Through surveys on fishing boats and interviews with fishermen, we found that traps placed in coastal areas during the cuttlefish breeding season have a high impact on cuttlefish eggs, with over 3 million eggs likely being destroyed by 3750 traps of 15 fishermen in less than 3 miles of coast. The use of removable ropes attached inside traps as an additional substrate for egg deposition allowed the recovery of 23.7% of the eggs deposited on the traps on average, without affecting the catch rate of adults. Experiments examining hatching success in the field highlighted the need for a careful choice of hatching sites to maximise the efficacy of the mitigation measure. Conclusions/Significance: The proposed mitigation measure reduced the impact of fishing on cuttlefish eggs, with no significant effect on the commercial catch. Fishermen showed a positive attitude towards the application of this measure, which is inexpensive and easy to employ. The direct involvement of fishermen in the management of this resource and the maintenance of traditional fishing methods are a novel aspect of the proposed measure and represent the basis for its success.;"[Melli, Valentina; Riginella, Emilio; Nalon, Marco; Mazzoldi, Carlotta] Univ Padua, Dept Biol, Padua, Italy";;Mazzoldi, C (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Biol, Padua, Italy.;carlotta.mazzoldi@unipd.it;"Mazzoldi, Carlotta/AAU-8628-2020; Riginella, Emilio/Q-2987-2019; Melli, Valentina/AAB-1980-2019";"Melli, Valentina/0000-0002-4778-9331; Riginella, Emilio/0000-0002-1442-8310";"project CLODIA; Veneto Region (Italy) (DGR) [4069]";This work was supported by the project CLODIA funded by the Veneto Region (Italy) Law 15/2007 (DGR n. 4069).

It has been identified to strongly influence the environmental performance of the fishing industry, including fuel use. As fuel data for fisheries is scarce, especially on a detailed level, the aim of this study was to develop an approach for utilizing fleet-wide fuel data to estimate the fuel use of individual fisheries and mapping how fuel efficiency in Swedish fisheries is influenced by management. Swedish demersal trawl fisheries were studied between 2002 and 2010: Results show that the overall fuel efficiency has improved and interesting patterns between different fisheries and vessel sizes emerged. The difference in fuel efficiency per kilo landing between large and small trawlers was generally small, unless catch capacity was lowered e.g. by selective grids. Stock rebuilding was shown to be highly important for fuel efficiency, as fuel use was inversely correlated to the biomass of eastern Baltic cod. However, rebuilding can also lead to trade-offs e.g. in the case of selective trawling, where protection of depleted stocks comes at the cost of higher fuel intensity per landing. Finally, tax exemption of fuel use in fisheries was shown to maintain inefficient fisheries. These results could be used to reduce overall environmental impacts of fishing further by incorporating fuel use as an additional aspect into the fisheries management system. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The common sole (Solea solea), an important commercial flatfish in the North Sea, Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, has a marine pelagic larval stage, a benthic juvenile stage in coastal nurseries (lagoons, estuaries or shallow marine areas) and a benthic adult stage in deeper marine waters on the continental shelf. To date, the ecological connectivity among these life stages has been little assessed in the Mediterranean. Here, such an assessment is provided for the first time for the Gulf of Lions, NW Mediterranean, based on a dataset on otolith microchemistry and stable isotopic composition as indicators of the water masses inhabited by individual fish. Specifically, otolith Ba/Ca and Sr/Ca profiles, and delta C-13 and delta O-18 values of adults collected in four areas of the Gulf of Lions were compared with those of young-of-the-year collected in different coastal nurseries. Results showed that a high proportion of adults (>46%) were influenced by river inputs during their larval stage. Furthermore Sr/Ca ratios and the otolith length at one year of age revealed that most adults (similar to 70%) spent their juvenile stage in nurseries with high salinity, whereas the remainder used brackish environments.

Square mesh panels of nominal 36 mm were evaluated in two separate combinations: left-right and middle on the codend. The 50% retention lengths (L-50) and selection ranges of left-right (SDS), middle (DSD) combinations and control codend for blue fish were estimated to be 13.03 and 3.82 cm, 12.91 and 3.71 cm, 12.49 and 3.68 cm respectively. The L-50 value of SDS and DSD codend were comparable with the L-50 value of the control codend; however, the control codend value was rather low. The values of SDS and DSD codend weren't very close to MLS of the bluefish (20 cm). For this reason, more than 36 mm square mesh panels can be used alternatively, instead of the 36 mm square mesh panel on the codends for the fishery of the bluefish and higher size selectivity can be obtained. However, it may not be successful fisheries when considering the minimum landing size for dominant species (whiting Merlangius merlangus (Linnaeus, 1758) and red mullet Mullus barbatus ponticus (Essipov, 1927), 13 cm) in the Black Sea trawl fishery. These results show that increasing the size selectivity in a multi-species trawl fishery using a single position or square mesh size is quite difficult. Furthermore, square mesh panel codends were more selective than diamond mesh codend (p < 0.05). Differences between left-right (SDS) position and middle (DSD) position were no significant (p > 0.05) for the square mesh panel codend.

The findings suggest that vessels respond to such situations by increasing pressure on unregulated species, using their spare capacity. This article models fishermen's behavior using a restricted profit function, treating the harvest of regulated species as fixed, while unregulated species are variable outputs. An empirical application is provided for the Polish trawler fleet with permits to harvest IVQ-regulated Atlantic Cod in the Baltic Sea. The results indicate a strong substitute relationship between the cod quota and pelagic species. Derived elasticities of intensity, providing a measure of the impact of a fixed-factor on variable factors, offer strong evidence of increasing pressure on pelagic species caused by decreasing quotas.;Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Environm & Business Econ, DK-6700 Esbjerg, Denmark;;Hutniczak, B (corresponding author), Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Environm & Business Econ, Niels Bohrs Vej 9, DK-6700 Esbjerg, Denmark.;bhu@sam.sdu.dk;;Hutniczak, Barbara/0000-0001-5152-7898;;;40;18;18;0;16;UNIV CHICAGO PRESS;CHICAGO;1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA;0738-1360;2334-5985;MAR RESOUR ECON;Mar.

The study was conducted during the September 2009-April 2010 fishing season. Twenty-one bottom trawler operations were sampled and the catch composition was determined. A total of 26 species were caught, which included 22 species of fish, 2 species of arthropods, 1 gastropod and 1 bivalve. Two of these were target species (Mullus barbatus, Merlangius merlangus), while 25 species were discarded, including trash fish and specimens below the legal size. A total of 2142.76 kg of biomass was caught during the operations, of which 53.99% was bycatch. The weighed discard rate was determined as 42.06% and two different groups were identified in discards (T1: 10-57 m, T2: 72-118 m) based on the depth. Significant differences were identified between these depth groups (p<0.05). It was determined that the biomass (kg h(-1)), the evenness index (J) (p<0.05), the average species number and species richness (D) (p<0.01) of the discards showed significant differences, but that the difference between species diversity (H) was negligible.

Salmon have been found to develop higher infestation of salmon lice at the upper parts of the water column. The use of tarpaulin skirts for shielding the upper part of a salmon cage has therefore been used as a measure for reducing the salmon lice infestation. A tarpaulin skirt will however increase the effective solidity of the net, and it is necessary to study the cage mooring loads, the net deformation and the water flow through and around the cage to prevent damage to the structures and the fish. Experiments were conducted at the North Sea Centre Flume Tank in Hirtshals, Denmark, with a model salmon cage and skirt in scale 1:17. The experiments showed that the skirt sheet on the upstream side gets increasingly pulled back and up toward the surface as currents increase, and lice are likely to pass underneath and into the cage. The mooring load on the cage was also increasing with the current speed, and approximately 40% higher than that of a cage without skirt. Due to the increase in mooring loads applied by a shielding skirt it is important to include the effects of a skirt when calculating mooring loads on a farm system. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Short-term availability of trawl-damaged prey, and longer-term shifts in benthic prey community composition, both have the potential to affect feeding opportunities and realized dietary preferences of bottom-feeding (benthivorous) fish. To investigate these effects of bottom-fishing activity (by otter trawls, beam trawls, and dredges) on the feeding of benthivorous fish, we compared the trophic level at body size and diets of four species in areas of the Celtic Sea subject to low, intermediate, and high fishing activity. Trophic level was estimated using nitrogen stable isotope analysis, and fishing activity was quantified with vessel monitoring system (VMS) data. For whiting (Merlangius merlangus) of all sizes, trophic level was slightly lower in areas of higher fishing activity. After accounting for the results of the diet analysis, we concluded that this reflected increased scavenging of benthic invertebrates in more intensively fished areas. For megrim (Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis), the rate of increase in trophic level with size was lower with increasing fishing activity, implying that megrim may also substitute fish with lower-trophic invertebrates that can be scavenged in more intensively fished areas. For plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and lemon sole (Microstomus kitt), no significant effects of fishing activity on trophic level were detected. We conclude that differences in the intensity of fishing activity with towed bottom gears had small but variable effects of the trophic size structure of the four species, and that this primarily reflected scavenging rather than diet changes following longer-term shifts in composition of the prey community.;"[Shephard, Samuel] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol Sci, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland; [Minto, Coilin; Zoelck, Melanie; Brophy, Deirdre] Galway Mayo Inst Technol, Marine & Freshwater Res Ctr, Galway, Ireland; [Jennings, Simon] Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Lowestoft Lab, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England; [Reid, David] Inst Marine, Oranmore, Galway, Ireland";;Shephard, S (corresponding author), Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol Sci, 97 Lisburn Rd, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland.;s.shephard@qub.ac.uk;"Jennings, Simon/F-5085-2012; Reid, David/ABC-5916-2021; Zolck, Melanie/P-5982-2014";"Jennings, Simon/0000-0002-2390-7225; Zolck, Melanie/0000-0003-4954-5178; Reid, Dave/0000-0002-8494-0918; Brophy, Deirdre/0000-0003-4111-762X; Minto, Coilin/0000-0003-0630-6775";"Department of Education Ireland, Technological Sector Research: Strand III Core Research Strengths Enhancement Programme; Marine Institute; Marine Research Sub-programme of the National Development Plan; UK Department of Environment, Food and Rural AffairsDepartment for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) [MF1225]";SS and CM were supported by grants from the Department of Education Ireland, Technological Sector Research: Strand III Core Research Strengths Enhancement Programme.

Species were collected with van-Veen grabs and beam trawls. Trophic position (i.e. nitrogen stable isotope ratios, delta N-15) and energy flow (i.e. species metabolism approximated by body mass scaled abundance) of dominant species were compared in trawled areas and an area protected from fisheries for 14 months in order to detect trawling cessation effects by trophic characteristics. At the community level, energy flow was lower in the protected area, but we were unable to detect significant changes in trophic position. At the species level energy flow in the protected area was lower for predating/scavenging species but higher for interface feeders. Species trophic positions of small predators/scavengers were lower and of deposit feeders higher in the protected area. Major reasons for trophic changes after trawling cessation may be the absence of artificial and additional food sources from trawling likely to attract predators and scavengers, and the absence of physical sediment disturbance impacting settlement/survival of less mobile species and causing a gradual shift in food availability and quality. Our results provide evidence that species or community energy flow is a good indicator to detect trawling induced energy-flow alterations in the benthic system, and that in particular species trophic properties are suitable to capture subtle and short-term changes in the benthos following trawling cessation.

The monitoring was carried out for 14 months covering periods of different trawling intensities and a close season for the trawling fleet. The seabed morphology was studied by side-scan sonar and sediment texture and organic carbon content were analysed. Suspended sediment vertical distribution was recorded by CTD+ turbidity hydrographic profiles and sediment transport was computed using time series from moored turbidimeters and current meters. The results show that the seabed of the fishing ground is strongly affected by scraping and ploughing induced by bottom trawling. Part of the finer fraction of the prodeltaic mud resuspended by trawling is winnowed, increasing the silt content of the settling sediment and also near-bottom turbidity. Sediment resuspended by trawling is incorporated in the bottom nepheloid layer and transported across-and along-shelf, increasing sediment fluxes. Trawling also induces an increase in the organic carbon content in the bottom sediment. All these effects induced by trawling have occurred during the last few decades, changing natural conditions in the fishing ground. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

While a number of studies have assessed the impacts of trawling on faunal community structure and the degree to Which different taxa are vulnerable to trawling, few have focused on how these impacts affect important ecological functions of the seabed. In this study, we use biological trait analysis (BTA) to assess the relative sensitivity of benthic macrofauna to trawling, in both the short- and long-term, and use this information to describe the spatial variation in sensitivity of secondary production for the Greater North Sea (GNS). Within the GNS, estimates of total production varied by almost three orders of magnitude, from 1.66 kJ m(-2) y(-1) to 968.9 kJ m(-2) y(-1). Large-scale patterns were observed in the proportion of secondary production derived from trawling-sensitive taxa. In the southem North Sea, total production is predominantly governed by taxa with low sensitivity to trawling, whereas production is relatively trawling-sensitive in the northern North Sea and western English Channel. In general, the more sensitive and productive regions are associated with poorly-sorted, gravelly or muddy sediments, while the less sensitive and less productive regions are associated with well-sorted, sandy substrates. These relationships between production sensitivity and environmental features are primarily due to variations in long-term recovery; total production of most assemblages is highly sensitive to the direct impacts of trawling.

One fishery severely affected by seal predation is the salmon trap fishery. Underwater cameras were placed in two pontoon traps to study the behavior of raiding gray seals. Seals observed on film were identified and a catalog of 'problem' seals was created, totaling 11 individuals. As part of this study, 8 pontoon traps modified for live-trapping raiding seals were set out in the same area. Trapped seals were killed and their markings photographed in order to try to match them with seals in the catalog. The eleven identified seals were responsible for 426 out of 600 visits to the two traps with cameras. Four of the eleven seals raided at least two traps and returned to raid traps frequently over the 2-year study period. Seals caught in the pontoon traps modified for live-trapping were mainly adult male seals. Three of these seals were identified as cataloged seals. This study has shown that it is generally adult male gray seals which have specialized in raiding fishing gear. These specialist seals have developed a characteristic behavior pattern and have persisted with it over a long period of time.

The Commission argues that this will create strong incentives for more selective fishing practices; however, there is little information to allow us to predict likely changes in fishing behaviour. Using detailed historic observer and logbook data from English North Sea otter trawlers and information on fish prices and landing costs, we examine the potential impact of a discard ban combined with either effort controls or catch quotas on the landings of an average trip. We calculate fishing incomes based on the assumption that existing fishing behaviour and catch compositions are maintained and compare this with incomes calculated on the assumption that all unwanted catch can be avoided. The difference provides an estimate of the maximum possible financial incentive for fishers to adopt more selective fishing practices. The calculations suggest that a discard ban in isolation will generate little economic incentive to operate more selectively. When combined with effort controls, a reduction in fishing effort may result in a proportional reduction in unwanted catches, but an incentive to actively avoid this catch is unlikely to be generated. Catch quotas would generate much stronger economic incentives, but only for the avoidance of the five quota species. So, contrary to the aims of the reformed CFP, a discard ban may not result in a dramatic reduction in unmarketable catches of all species. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Historical patterns of exploitation associated with this species suggest that it is currently not possible to manage its fisheries in the Northeast Atlantic sustainably, and the total allowable catch for orange roughy has been gradually reduced to zero for European fisheries since 2010. Orange roughy to the west of Ireland and Britain occurs on distinct bathymetric features (seamounts, hills and canyons) as well as on flat ground along the continental slope. Productivity-susceptibility analysis (PSA) was performed to evaluate the biological vulnerability of orange roughy in relation to other deepwater species and the risk that recent and current fisheries pose to its populations in the study area. Time-dependant PSA, based on the spatial overlap between orange roughy distribution and recent and current deepwater fisheries demonstrated a strong reduction in risk over time when fisheries stopped directed targeting practices and continued with mixed deepwater trawl fisheries. Some spatial overlap between the species and current fisheries remains, and while the method can show relative risk reduction, it cannot provide information on whether the risk is low enough to allow the recovery of depleted populations.;"[Dransfeld, Leonie; Gerritsen, Hans D.] Inst Marine, Oranmore, Galway, Ireland; [Hareide, Nils R.] Runde Environm Ctr, N-6096 Runde, Norway; [Lorance, Pascal] IFREMER, F-44311 Nantes 03, France";;Dransfeld, L (corresponding author), Inst Marine, Oranmore, Galway, Ireland.;leonie.dransfeld@marine.ie;Lorance, Pascal/F-4668-2011;Lorance, Pascal/0000-0002-6453-2925;DEEPFISHMAN [227390];We would like to thank all scientists and skippers for their cooperation in the provision of survey and observer data.

Fishermen claim that Mistral episodes facilitate the entry of tuna schools towards the traps, thus increasing capture rates. To test the fishermen's hypothesis we conducted underwater visual counts of tuna in the trap chambers and analysed these data under the effect of wind. The results indicate a stair-step pattern in the abundance of tuna, demonstrating that major increases in abundance are associated with the Mistral. The second analytical approach involved a longer time scale to test whether higher Mistral occurrences corresponded to periods when higher captures were recorded. Using a linear regression model we found a significant correlation (p<0.01) between catches and the wind speed class <= 15 knots. We hypothesize that the wind-driven current may produce favourable conditions for tuna migration and could play a significant role in enabling fish to save energy. It was also noted that the wind speed class >15 knots seemed to have a negative effect on captures. This pattern may be caused by wind-induced advection of coastal waters generating a physical boundary that may have had a deterrent effect on tuna schools.;"[Addis, Piero; Secci, Marco; Cau, Angelo] Univ Cagliari, Dept Life Sci & Environm, I-09126 Cagliari, Italy";;Addis, P (corresponding author), Univ Cagliari, Dept Life Sci & Environm, Via Fiorelli 1, I-09126 Cagliari, Italy.;addisp@unica.it;Addis, Piero/C-5855-2016;Addis, Piero/0000-0002-0464-0270;;;45;4;4;0;17;CONSEJO SUPERIOR INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS-CSIC;MADRID;VITRUVIO 8, 28006 MADRID, SPAIN;0214-8358;1886-8134;SCI MAR;Sci.

These windmill artificial reefs (WARs) harbour high abundances of fish species which can be attracted from elsewhere or can be the result of extra production induced by these wind farms. To resolve the attraction-production debate in suddenly altered ecosystems (cf. wind farms), the possible consequences of attraction should be assessed; thereby bearing in mind that ecological traps may arise. In this paper we investigated whether the wind farms in the Belgian part of the North Sea act as ecological traps for pouting and Atlantic cod. Length-at-age, condition and diet composition of fish present at the windmill artificial reefs was compared to local and regional sandy areas. Fish data from the period 2009-2012 were evaluated. Mainly I- and II-group Atlantic cod were present around the WARs; while the 0- and I-group dominated for pouting. For Atlantic cod, no differences in length were observed between sites, indicating that fitness was comparable at the WARs and in sandy areas. No significant differences in condition index were observed for pouting. At the WARs, they were slightly larger and stomach fullness was enhanced compared to the surrounding sandy areas. Also diet differed considerably among the sites. The outcome of the proxies indicate that fitness of pouting was slightly enhanced compared to the surrounding sandy areas. No evidence was obtained supporting the hypothesis that the WARs act as an ecological trap for Atlantic cod and pouting. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Researchers have struggled to account for saturation when using trap catch to infer population dynamics. We used the underwater video to document entries and exits of black sea bass (Centropristis striata) from chevron traps (n = 26) to quantify catch saturation. Black sea bass catch varied between 3 and 188 individuals for soak times of similar to 90 min. Overall, 3564 black sea bass entered the traps and 1826 exited; therefore, over half (51%) of black sea bass entering traps exited before traps were retrieved. Black sea bass catch rates were non-linear and asymptotic for most (81%) trap samples, despite short soak times. Moreover, catch saturation occurred at 50 min, when the entry rate declined and the exit rate increased to a point where their confidence intervals overlapped. Several lines of evidence suggest that the level of black sea bass catch once saturation occurred may be positively related to true abundance, but additional research is needed to more fully test this hypothesis.";"[Bacheler, Nathan M.; Schobernd, Zeb H.; Berrane, David J.; Schobernd, Christina M.; Mitchell, Warren A.; Geraldi, Nathan R.] NOAA, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA";;Bacheler, NM (corresponding author), NOAA, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, 101 Pivers Isl Rd, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA.;nate.bacheler@noaa.gov;"Schobernd, Zeb/V-4379-2019; Geraldi, Nathan/AAA-3645-2020";Geraldi, Nathan/0000-0002-2669-3867;;;44;19;21;0;23;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;1054-3139;1095-9289;ICES J MAR SCI;ICES J.

This study surveyed 11 sites, associated with trawling grounds and subjected to different levels of fishing intensity, located in four areas of the Mediterranean: one in Italy, the Central Tyrrhenian coast, one in Greece, the eastern Ionian coast, and two in Spain, the Murcian and Catalan coasts. Samples were collected during an oceanographic cruise undertaken from the 21 May to the 24 June 2009. Results showed geographical variation in the density of marine debris which ranged from 0 to 405 pieces per hectare in the surveyed areas, plastics being the dominant components. Variability within sites was higher than between areas, indicating small-scale patchiness in the distribution of the debris over the seafloor. Though the study areas were within trawling grounds, the density of debris was not significantly correlated with fishing effort. More than 30% of plastics were between 10 and 20 cm width/length, and more than 40% of the plastics were colonized by a biofilm of microorganisms, suggesting indirect effects on benthic communities.;"[Sanchez, Pilar; Maso, Mercedes; Saez, Raquel; De Juan, Silvia; Muntadas, Alba; Demestre, Montserrat] CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain";;Sanchez, P (corresponding author), CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain.;pilar@icm.csic.es;"de Juan Mohan, Silvia/P-2899-2019; Demestre, Montserrat/M-1719-2014";"de Juan Mohan, Silvia/0000-0002-8891-8371; Demestre, Montserrat/0000-0003-2866-4821";"COMSOM [CTM2008-04617/MAR]; Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovacionInstituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government";Data used in this work were collected in the framework of the research project COMSOM (CTM2008-04617/MAR) funded by the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion.

The highest densities of susceptible species occur in temperate and sub-polar regions of both hemispheres, with lower densities in tropical regions. Gillnet fisheries are widespread and particularly prevalent in coastal areas. A review of reported bycatch estimates suggests that at least 400,000 birds die in gillnets each year. The highest bycatch has been reported in the Northwest Pacific, Iceland and the Baltic Sea. Species suffering potentially significant impacts of gillnet mortality include common guillemot (Uria aalge), thick-billed guillemot (Uria lomvia), red-throated loon (Gavia stellata), Humboldt penguin (Spheniscus humboldti), Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus), yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes), little penguin (Eudyptula minor), greater scaup (Aythya manila) and long-tailed duck (Clangula hyemalis). Although reports of seabird bycatch in gillnets are relatively numerous, the magnitude of this phenomenon is poorly known for all regions. Further, population modelling to assess effects of gillnet bycatch mortality on seabird populations has rarely been feasible and there is a need for further data to advance development of bycatch mitigation measures.

Climate change forcing was derived from the HadRM3-PPE-UK regional climate model for the UK for the period 1950-2100 using historical emissions and a medium emissions scenario (SRESA1B). Effects of demersal trawling were implemented as an additional mortality on benthic fauna, and changes in the benthic-pelagic nutrient and carbon fluxes. The main impacts of climate change were (i) a temperature-driven increase in pelagic metabolic rates and nutrient cycling, (ii) an increase in primary production fuelled by recycled nutrients, (iii) a decrease in benthic biomass due to increased benthic metabolic rates and decreased food supply as a result of the increased pelagic cycling, and (iv) a decrease in near-bed oxygen concentrations. The main impacts of trawling were (i) reduced benthic biomass due to the increased mortality, and (ii) the increased benthic-pelagic nutrient fluxes, with these effects counteracting each other, and relatively small changes in other variables. One important consequence was a large decrease in the de-nitrification flux predicted at the two summer-stratified sites because less benthic nitrate was available. The effects of trawling scaled linearly with fishing effort, with greatest sensitivity to fishing in summer compared to fishing in winter. The impacts of climate change and trawling were additive, suggesting little or no non-linear interactions between these disturbances.;"[Molen, Johan van der; Aldridge, John N.; Coughlan, Clare; Parker, Eleanor Ruth; Stephens, David] Ctr Environm, Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci CEFAS, Lowestoft, Suffolk, England; [Molen, Johan van der; Aldridge, John N.; Coughlan, Clare; Parker, Eleanor Ruth; Stephens, David] Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci CEFAS, Lowestoft, Suffolk, England; [Ruardij, Piet] Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res NIOZ, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands";;Molen, J (corresponding author), Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci CEFAS, Pakefield Rd, Lowestoft, Suffolk, England.;"johan.vandermolen@cefas.co.uk; rua@nioz.nl";"Eayrs, Clare/T-7969-2019; Parker, Ruth M/S-4583-2017";"Eayrs, Clare/0000-0003-3129-7604; Parker, Ruth M/0000-0001-9685-6396";Department for Environment, Food and Rural affairs (Defra)Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) [E3205];The research was funded by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural affairs (Defra) through contract E3205.

This, combined with a stock that has declined dramatically over the past 30 years, has led to numerous technical regulations being introduced to reduce the capture of juveniles and thus discards. One method that has been widely adopted in the Baltic Sea has been to improve gear selectivity, subsequently allowing young individuals to escape capture. To understand the effects that changes to gear selectivity and minimum landing size have had on discard rates, as well as the effects of a range of additional explanatory factors, generalized additive mixed models were used. Gear regulation changes enforced in the Danish demersal trawl fishery in the Baltic Sea and other factors, such as minimum landings size, juvenile abundance, catch mass, price, and their spatial and temporal distribution, were found to significantly affect discard rates. The newest and currently legislated gears were identified as having the lowest discard rates. The increase in minimum landing size from 35 to 38 cm has increased discard rates.;"[Feekings, Jordan; Madsen, Niels] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, DK-9850 Hirtshals, Denmark; [Lewy, Peter] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, DK-2920 Charlottenlund, Denmark";;Feekings, J (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, North Sea Sci Pk,POB 101, DK-9850 Hirtshals, Denmark.;jpfe@aqua.dtu.dk;Feekings, Jordan/AAJ-1245-2021;"Feekings, Jordan/0000-0001-9103-7332; Madsen, Niels/0000-0002-4409-1122";"MariFish project: Bycatch And Discards: Management, Indicators, Trends And Location (BADMINTON); Danish Research CouncilDet Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)";We thank the at-sea observers for their hard work and dedication in collecting the data, the fishermen and the Danish Fishermen's Association for their collaboration, and Helle Andersen for helping extract the data.

The anglerfish is essentially an opportunistic feeder' that consumes mainly fishes, crustaceans and molluscs. Fishes were the primary food consumed by all size classes; the favourite prey was Merluccius merluccius (TL >150mm for medium and large anglerfish) and Gaidropsarus biscayensis (TL <150mm for smaller anglerfish). However, the proportion of fish species and molluscs changed with the body size of the anglerfish.

Bird carcasses were collected and information on fishing effort obtained from fishermen using interviews and on-board observations on selected trips. Bycatch of seabirds occurred with all types of fishing gear and metiers studied, with highest bycatch rates in coastal lagoons. The minimum estimate of total bycatch in nets set by 440 commercial fishermen was found to be 17 551 (range 14 90520 533) birds annually between November and May. Bycatch in set nets and on longlines in summer was much lower. Bycatch rates were found to depend either directly on bird abundance as shown for the long-tailed duck (Clangula hyemalis) or on predictors of abundance such as water depth and location. Bycatch in the Pomeranian Bay has decreased over 20years due to the severe decline of seaducks, particularly of long-tailed ducks, which were most frequently bycaught. The estimated individual bycatch risk has also decreased in long-tailed ducks but the current monthly losses of 0.81% may still indicate a potential threat for this species. Bycatch monitoring based on carcass collections and interviews proved to be feasible over a 20-year period although the results contain some underreporting. Based on the results specific measures are recommended to reduce bycatch risk in the German coastal fisheries using targeted effort reductions and replacement of set nets with alternative gear.

The most relevant trawlable species were analysed using quantitative data gathered in 260 daylight lasting hauls, which covered a large portion (about 100 000 km(2)) of the investigated area. The index of local abundance, standardized to 1 km(2), both in weight (Biomass Index), number (Density Index) and mean body weight were obtained for each species and for all species combined. A spatial representation of the Density Index was produced for all decapod crustaceans combined and for the most frequent species. In particular, the indices were transferred under a GIS system and spatial maps produced by applying the program ArcView (TM) 9.0. Different interpolators were tested and the most exact interpolator (IDW Inverse Distance Weighting) was chosen. Both historical (i.e., doubts about the presence or identification of the species) and spatial (i.e., differential distribution among different fishing areas) heterogeneity were detected and commented upon. Concerning the trawlable bottoms, very few species (such as Parapenaeus longirostris (Lucas, 1846), Aristaeomorpha foliacea (Risso, 1827), Aristeus antennatus (Risso, 1816), Nephrops norvegicus (Linnaeus, 1758) and Plesionika martia (A. Milne-Edwards, 1883)) are consistently and largely represented in the catches. A high spatial heterogeneity, likely reflecting the complex interaction between fishing pattern, hydrological features and bottom typology, was made evident.;"[Spano, Nunziacarla; Porporato, Erika M.

These sites, at 32-82 m in depth, were associated with fishing grounds and the trawling intensity was estimated at the site scale to assess the effects of trawling on benthic communities. Each site was surveyed with Multi-Beam (bathymetry and backscatter), side-scan sonar, benthic grabs and a surface dredge. The sites were clustered in three habitat types. Habitat 1, with moderate trawling disturbance, was characterised by homogeneous mud and associated epifauna that was also highly homogeneous across sites. Habitat 2, with sandy mud and scattered gravel and rocks, had a high abundance of sessile suspension feeders that probably attach to the coarser substratum and benefit from the low fishing disturbance in these sites. Habitat 3 included sites with heterogeneous sediments with maerl as the prevailing biocenosis and having the highest species richness, despite being subjected to variable trawling intensity. Statistical models were used to relate environmental parameters and the species abundance. More than 3 physical variables were necessary to explain the epifaunal patterns across sites, including the percentage of mud, sediment heterogeneity and fishing effort These analyses are an essential step for extrapolating information from benthic samples to the larger scale of habitats, mapped through acoustic surveys. Despite this, a good integration is required between the mapping of physical habitat distribution and the ecological knowledge of communities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Flexible net strands are modeled by non-linear truss elements having two nodes. Hydrodynamic loads due to relative motion of the net with the surrounding fluid are computed using the Morison equation. The coupled hydrodynamic-elastodynamic equations are solved using finite element (FE) approximations. Furthermore, experimental data are presented for the drag resistance of a purse seine net, commonly used as fishing tool in the Mediterranean sea. The measurements were conducted in the towing tank of NTUA on a sample of a net. The net was tested in three configurations: vertical, horizontal and inclined at 45 degrees The derived drag coefficients are compared to predictions of the FEM developed model. The vertical submergence behavior of the seine in calm water is also examined, both experimentally and theoretically. Moreover, the shooting phase of the purse-seine fishing is simulated with the aim to investigate the diving behavior of the net. The flow shading effect of neighboring strands is identified as a critical parameter for the consistent predictions of the diving behavior. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;"[Riziotis, V.

Commercial trawling is the most recurrent and pervasive of human impacts on the deep-sea floor, but studies on its consequences on the biogeochemistry of deep-sea sediments are still scarce. Pigments, fatty acids, amino acids and carbohydrates were analysed in sediments from the flanks of the La Fonera (Palamos) submarine canyon (NW Mediterranean Sea), where a commercial bottom trawling fishery has been active for more than 70 yr. More specifically, we investigated how trawling-induced sediment reworking affects the quality of sedimentary organic matter which reaches the seafloor and accumulates in the sediment column, which is fundamental for the development of benthic communities. Sediment samples were collected during two oceanographic cruises in spring and autumn 2011. The sampled sites included trawl fishing grounds as well as pristine (control) areas. We report that bottom trawling in the flanks of the La Fonera Canyon has caused an alteration of the quality of the organic matter accumulated in the upper 5 cm of the seafloor. The use of a wide pool of biochemical tracers characterized by different reactivity to degradation allowed for us to discriminate the long-term effects of trawl-induced sediment reworking from the natural variability caused by the seasonal cycle of production and sinking of biogenic particles. Differences between untrawled and trawled areas were evidenced by labile amino acids, while differences between spring and autumn samples were detected only by the more labile indicators chlorophyll a and monounsaturated fatty acids. These results suggest that changes in the biochemical composition of the sedimentary organic matter caused by bottom trawling can be more relevant than those associated with natural seasonality and pose serious concerns about the ecological sustainability of deep-sea trawling activities.;"[Sane, E.; Martin, J.; Puig, P.; Palanques, A.] CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain";;Sane, E (corresponding author), CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, Passeig Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain.;sane@icm.csic.es;"sane, elisabet/AAT-4775-2020; Puig, Pere/E-5422-2013; Palanques, Albert/C-2661-2013; Martin, Jacobo/F-1388-2011";"Puig, Pere/0000-0001-6189-5504; Martin, Jacobo/0000-0001-8933-7731; , elisabet/0000-0001-5719-5468; Palanques, Albert/0000-0003-2544-2342";"European Community's Seventh Framework Programme under the HERMIONE project [226354]; complementary action of the Spanish National Plan [CTM2010-11084-E]; JAE-DOC contract within the programme Junta para la Ampliacion de Estudios; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas; European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF)";We are grateful to the officers and crew of the RV Garcia del Cid and all the participants in oceanographic cruises HERMIONE I and II for their help at sea.

The resulting catch loss engenders hostility from fishers, and interactions between dolphins and nets can result in bycatch mortality. One potential mitigation measure is the placement of marine mammal acoustic deterrent devices, or pingers, on the nets. With the support of local fishermen, Aquamark 210 pingers were deployed on trammel net set for cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) during the spring season (March 2010 to May 2010), when there is more interaction with dolphin. Throughout the period of experimentation, we have used trammel nets equipped with pingers (pinger net) and trammel nets that have played the role of control (control net). During the trial, data on fishing operations were recorded by onboard observers. We analysed two response variables, the presence or absence of evidence that dolphins had interacted with the net and catch per unit effort. The pingers attracted the bottlenose dolphins (T truncatus) to trammels nets. Overall, pinger nets were more attacked than control nets. Tested pingers. also appeared to have affected on fishery target species. The catch per unit effort decreased by 22%. Our results suggest that Aquamark 210 pingers in the artisanal fisheries of Kerkennah islands increase the rate of net interaction, but it was recommended to investigate how bottlenose dolphin (T. truncatus) may interact with other acoustic devices.;"[Ayadi, Amani; Ghorbel, Mohamed; Bradai, Mohamed Nejmeddine] Natl Inst Sea Sci & Technol, Sfax 3018, Tunisia";;Ayadi, A (corresponding author), Natl Inst Sea Sci & Technol, POB 1035, Sfax 3018, Tunisia.;ayadiamani2007@yahoo.com;;;ACCOBAMS;This study would have not been possible without the financial assistance of ACCOBAMS.

These data are unique in the Baltic Sea region. To date, they only have been known from summary reports that have been cited repeatedly in papers regarding the habitat preference and sizes of historical populations of harbour porpoises in the Baltic Sea. Lacking other sources of information, archival data had a great importance in the delimitation of Special Areas of Conservation (NATURA 2000) designated for harbour porpoise in Poland. Analysis of archival source materials suggested discrepancies between fisheries inspectors' reports and the published data. These new data provided detailed information on harbour porpoise bycatch, including the time of capture, gear type utilized, and the location of fishing grounds where harbour porpoises were most frequently caught. In summation, fisheries inspectors registered 691 individual harbour porpoises. The animals were registered primarily in the spring, from March to April, during targeted salmonid catches throughout the Gdansk Bay region and the open sea off the Hel Peninsula coast. The majority of caught animals were recorded from the Hel fishing district. Contrary to conclusions to date, these instances cannot be attributed to the bounties offered for the elimination of pests. This paper also addresses and discusses the dependence on the number of registered harbour porpoise catches over a series of years and the maximum ice cover on the Baltic Sea as the factors influencing harbour porpoises' periodic declines (Teilmann & Lowry, 1996).;Natl Marine Fisheries Res Inst, Dept Fisheries Resources, PL-81332 Gdynia, Poland;;Psuty, I (corresponding author), Natl Marine Fisheries Res Inst, Dept Fisheries Resources, Ul Kollataja 1, PL-81332 Gdynia, Poland.;iwona.psuty@mir.gdynia.pl;;;;;23;1;1;0;13;EUROPEAN ASSOC AQUATIC MAMMALS;MOLINE;C/O DR JEANETTE THOMAS, BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, WESTERN ILLIONIS UNIV-QUAD CITIES, 3561 60TH STREET, MOLINE, IL 61265 USA;0167-5427;;AQUAT MAMM;Aquat.

These impacts are modified by the environmental context in which they occur. Communities that occur in habitats subjected to low levels of natural disturbance are considered to be the most vulnerable to bottom trawling. The present study examined the impact of otter trawl fisheries on epifaunal assemblages of the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea (Central Mediterranean Sea), across the continental shelf and down to the meso-bathyal plain. Using a long time-series of non-target epifaunal species collected by experimental otter trawl surveys, differences in assemblage structure and composition were detected among areas that experienced different levels of fishing intensity relative to Fishery Exclusion Zones. Areas that experienced the highest levels of trawling had a significantly lower abundance of crinoids and ophiuroids; the former are important structuring fauna. The epifaunal assemblage composition in the areas that had been subjected to the heaviest levels of fishing activity were characterised by a greater number of scavenging species that are resilient to the effects of fishing. Although the heavily trawled areas had higher diversity than the less heavily fished areas, this was associated with the absence of K-selected species such as crinoids and dominance by r-selected scavenging biota.";"[Mangano, M.

However, it is largely unknown how dredging affects fish communities. In this study patterns and impacts of fish bycatch in scallop dredges around the Isle of Man, in the north Irish Sea, were investigated by analysing data from fisheries-independent surveys conducted between 1992 and 2005. Almost all (97.6%) tows of the survey gear generated fish bycatch, with a total of approximately 50 species recorded. Cuckoo ray (Leucoraja naevus) and monkfish (Lophius piscatorius) dominated the bycatch, accounting for 46.82% of the total. Three other species of particular commercial or ecological interest; lemon sole (Microstomus kitt), plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and lesser spotted dogfish (Scyliorhinus caniculus), were also abundant. Most of the cuckoo ray, monkfish and plaice captured were juveniles, whereas lesser spotted dogfish and lemon sole were a mixture of juveniles and adults. In general, rates of fish bycatch appeared low, but this may be at least partly because background fish densities around the Isle of Man were also low. There was considerable spatial, temporal, and species-specific variation in fish bycatch, and the finer meshed dredges traditionally used to catch queen scallops (Aequipecten opercularis), caught significantly more fish than the great scallop (Pecten maximus) dredges. The density of lesser spotted dogfish bycatch increased significantly over the 14?years of the study whereas the density of monkfish decreased significantly. These patterns appear to reflect differences in the susceptibility of the two species to capture and damage by scallop dredging, and/or have been caused by regional trends in stock levels. An assessment of the impact of the local great scallop dredge fishery indicated that it may be catching substantial numbers of monkfish. Given the recent expansion of scallop dredging around the UK, such effects should be factored into ecosystem-based management plans.Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.";"[Craven, Helen R.; Stewart, Bryce D.] Univ York, Dept Environm, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Brand, Andrew R.] Univ Liverpool, Sch Biol Sci, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England";;Stewart, BD (corresponding author), Univ York, Dept Environm, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.;bryce.beukers-stewart@york.ac.uk;"Beukers-Stewart, Bryce D/B-5262-2011; Stewart, Bryce Donald/ABC-2440-2021";;"Department of Environment, Food and Agriculture of the Isle of Man Government; Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom";This research was largely funded by the Department of Environment, Food and Agriculture of the Isle of Man Government.

There is a high discarding of plaice in the active demersal fisheries in the North Sea. The change in fisheries management towards a more ecosystem based approach, together with a greater focus on sustainability, has caused a severe need for action. Subsequently, the European Commission is preparing regulations to reduce or even ban discards. The trawl fisheries are commercially the most important Danish fishery targeting plaice. Here we analyse discard data collected onboard Danish vessels in the period from 1998 to 2008. We describe the general patterns in these data by dividing them into three mesh size categories: 80-99 mm, 100-119 mm and >= 120 mm to reflect implemented technical measures of relevance. We analyse the landed and discarded portions in these mesh size categories and link the discarding to the minimum landing size. We employed a GAM model to assess how discarding of plaice below the minimum landing size is connected to relevant factors that could be of relevance from a management perspective. We identified a statistical significant effect of mesh size category and area. We discuss the results in relation to potential mitigation measures to be implemented in future fisheries management strategies. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we provide empirical data demonstrating fish conservation benefits of partial MPA when the stocks in question are mainly exploited by recreational angling. We studied a multi-species recreational fishery from the Balearic Islands (Mediterranean Sea) comparing three kinds of spatially close managed areas. The implementation of a partial MPA decreased the fishing pressure attracted, and the protected areas hosted greater abundances and larger-sized fish compared to areas of open access. Possibly the greatest conservation benefit of partial MPA resulted from the reduced fishing effort attracted, likely as a result of aversion of anglers to use areas where some form of management is affecting the recreational experience. In addition, the constraints on artisanal fishing may also have contributed to the conservation benefits we found. Depending on the right social and ecological context, partial MPA may therefore work as expected. Our study is observational and therefore cause-and-effect cannot be conclusively provided. However, our positive data suggest that more empirical data from other recreational fisheries and stocks should be collected before discarding the use of partial MPA in terms of providing a suitable compromise between conservation objectives and securing access to resources.

Comparisons were made for three size classes of hake encompassing 60 to 410 mm total length. Fish were collected from 50 to 200 m depth on muddy bottoms. The diets of hake of small and medium size were similar overall but more selective in the untrawled gulf. Greater differences were detected between the diets of larger specimens from trawled and untrawled areas. In the untrawled gulf large hake mainly preyed on clupeoid fish, while in the trawled gulfs other fish prey were found in the stomach contents. delta N-15 values of hake did not vary significantly between trawled and untrawled areas, while there was a clear effect of size, with larger individuals being significantly more enriched than juveniles. Conversely, delta C-13 values were generally more depleted for individuals collected in the untrawled area, suggesting a more pelagic source of carbon.

Based on 4 experimental surveys carried out between 1985 and 2008, we obtained quantitative data on the fauna associated with live coral stands. We show that species richness of invertebrates and crustaceans, as well as abundance and biomass of crustaceans, is higher in areas with large stands of the coral. Some commercial fishery species are also more abundant or reach larger sizes in areas with high density of the coral, particularly the red shrimps Aristeus antennatus (Risso, 1816) and Plesionika martia (A.

Migration dates and durations towards and away from the Mediterranean Sea were estimated based on the daily catch per unit effort (CPUE) by the traps. Migration patterns were very stable during these three years. The entry migration took place over an average of 42 days, and the return lasted 53 days. Daily catches show large waves of tunas passing during the two migratory phases. It can be hypothesised that each of these waves of tuna spent about 52 days in the Mediterranean Sea, and that each group was stable and consistent during their arrival and return migrations. Migration trajectories along the Algarve coast can be estimated from the daily CPUEs of the different traps. They appear to be different between the arrival and return migrations. The daily data per trap show that most traps caught entering bluefin at quite low CPUE, whereas only a few traps were efficient for catching the returning bluefin, but with much larger catches and CPUEs. The analysis of catch and CPUEs during the entering and leaving phases allowed us to conclude that the catchability and fishing mortality of the bluefin stock in the Algarve trap fishery was much larger during the return migration. Additional daily data from other traps, both historical and contemporary, should be collected and analyzed in order to provide more comprehensive results on the patterns and changes in migration, stock structure and stock exploitation rate.;"[Fonteneau, Alain] IRD, F-34203 Sete, France; [Pereira, Joao Gil] Univ Azores, P-9900 Horta, Portugal";;Fonteneau, A (corresponding author), IRD, BP 171, F-34203 Sete, France.;Alain.fonteneau@ird.fr;;Pereira, Joao/0000-0002-6651-0017;;;24;0;0;0;23;EDP SCIENCES S A;LES ULIS CEDEX A;17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE;0990-7440;1765-2952;AQUAT LIVING RESOUR;Aquat.

The sampling procedure was repeated every 3 h within a timeframe of 48 h. All species above a size of 1 cm were recorded quantitatively. The analysis of the dataset, consisting of thirteen sampling years, revealed rhythmic abundance fluctuations of one crustacean and two fish species, depending on the time of day. In order to check the accuracy of the results obtained, we further analysed the dataset for short-term effects of continuous trawling at the same track on the abundance of individual species. No direct effect on the abundance of particular species was detected, but the analysis revealed a periodic fluctuation of the mean number of individuals and the mean catch volume.

In this study, we analyzed genetic polymorphisms at a fragment of the mitochondrial control region (mtDNA CR) and 7 nuclear microsatellite loci, for 52 animals stranded and by-caught between 2000 and 2010 along the Atlantic coasts of France. The analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial loci provided contrasting results. The mtDNA revealed two genetically distinct groups, one closely related to the Iberian and African harbour porpoises, and the second related to individuals from the more northern waters of Europe. In contrast, nuclear polymorphisms did not display such a distinction. Nuclear markers suggested that harbour porpoises behaved as a randomly mating population along the Atlantic coasts of France. The difference between the two kinds of markers can be explained by differences in their mode of inheritance, the mtDNA being maternally inherited in contrast to nuclear loci that are bi-parentally inherited. Our results provide evidence that a major proportion of the animals we sampled are admixed individuals from the two genetically distinct populations previously identified along the Iberian coasts and in the North East Atlantic. The French Atlantic coasts are clearly the place where these two previously separated populations of harbour porpoises are now admixing. The present shifts in distribution of harbour porpoises along this coast is likely caused by habitat changes that will need to be further studied.;"[Alfonsi, Eric; Carpentier, Francois-Gilles; Jung, Jean-Luc] Univ Europeenne Bretagne, Lab BioGeMME Biol & Genet Mammiferes Marins Leur, Brest, France; [Alfonsi, Eric; Carpentier, Francois-Gilles; Jung, Jean-Luc] Univ Bretagne Occidentale, Brest, France; [Alfonsi, Eric; Hassani, Sami; Le Clec'h, Jean-Yves] Oceanopolis, Lab Etude Mammiferes Marins, Brest, France; [Alfonsi, Eric] Univ Europeenne Bretagne, LEMAR, Brest, France; [Dabin, Willy; Van Canneyt, Olivier] Univ La Rochelle, CNRS, UMS 3462, Observ PELAGIS, La Rochelle, France; [Fontaine, Michael C.] Univ Paris 11, CNRS, Lab Ecol Systemat & Evolut, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Fontaine, Michael C.] Univ Paris 07, CNRS, MNHN, Musee Homme,UMR 5145, Paris, France";;Alfonsi, E (corresponding author), Univ Europeenne Bretagne, Lab BioGeMME Biol & Genet Mammiferes Marins Leur, Brest, France.;jung@univ-brest.fr;"Jung, Jean-Luc/H-5108-2011; Fontaine, Michael/G-5350-2011";"Jung, Jean-Luc/0000-0002-8795-8056; Fontaine, Michael/0000-0003-1156-4154";"ANRT (Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie)French National Research Agency (ANR); ANR NUTGENEVOL research projectFrench National Research Agency (ANR)";Eric Alfonsi is supported by a grant Cifre of the ANRT (Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie, http://www.anrt.asso.fr).

This study were examined the effect of square mesh escape panel installation on selectivity of demersal trawl codends for whiting (Merlangius merlangus euxinus, N.) in the Black Sea. Codend mesh selectivity experiments were carried out using 40 mm nominal diamond mesh PE codend with 36 mm and 40 mm mesh size square mesh escape window inserted in the forward part of the top panel. The experiments were carried out in the southern Black Sea between February and March 2006 on a traditional fishing boat. A total of 6 valid hauls were made by using the hooped covered codend method. Selectivity parameters were calculated by using a logistic equation with the maximum likelihood method. Mean L(50)s and selection ranges of whiting were determined as 12.57 (se. 0.41) cm and 3.45 (se. 0.03) cm for 40 mm nominal diamond mesh, 12.71 (se. 0.45) cm and 3.12 (se. 0.03) cm for 36 mm square mesh panel and 13.55 (se. 0.32) cm and 3.70 (se. 0.02) cm for 40 mm square mesh panel, respectively.

However, the possible impact of other fishing methods has not been adequately addressed, especially for artisanal and amateur fisheries that use coastal nets. Coastal net fisheries, including driftnets and set nets, used at a much shallower depth (<40?m) in the Mediterranean, result in a large bycatch of loggerhead turtles in the neritic zone. The mortality rate with these fisheries seems to be higher than with other commercial fisheries. In the Mediterranean context, additional assessments on fishery characteristics and fishing gear parameters to: (i) develop a simple and unanimous definition of an artisanal fishery; and (ii) standardize units for reporting sea turtle bycatch with coastal nets, are needed to provide an understanding of the current relative degree of risk coastal net fisheries pose to turtle populations. Mitigation measures based on (a) gear-technology approaches, (b) fisheries closures, and (c) increased awareness and education of fishermen, must be considered as priorities and should be implemented without further delay.

Using two North Sea prohibited trawling areas (PTAs) established > 80 years ago, social (fishers' perceptions), management (fishing effort and compliance) and ecological (fish abundance and size) data were combined to assess the PTAs against their primary societal (conflict resolution) and secondary ecological (stock protection) objectives. Fishers perceived that the PTAs resolved conflicts between static and mobile gear sectors, despite evidence of non-compliance. However, few fishers perceived that they personally benefited from the PTAs. Fish abundance and size data from baited traps (BT) and video (BY) provided no evidence of PTA effects, but trawling effort was a significant predictor of BT fish abundance data and improved the model of BV fish abundance data. The absence of PTA effects on fish is attributable to non-compliance, the high mobility of the fish involved and their continued exploitation within the PTAs using static gear. This points to the need for greater understanding of the behaviour of fishers in relation to closures. The study also highlights the challenges of quantifying possible fishery benefits of small temperate closed areas and questions whether widely advocated fishery benefits may have enhanced initial support, but failure to deliver them may erode faith in such closures as a fisheries management tool.;"[Bloomfield, H.

Wet weight and number of specimens of G. acutus were obtained and related to environmental variables ( depth, sediment type, and organic matter percentage) at each haul and to trawl fishing effort. With this information and the otter trawl effort data, the environmental requirements and the impact of the trawl fishery on G. acutus populations were analysed. Although the species was present in all depth strata and all sediment types studied, it had clear habitat preferences, as greater abundances and mean weight values were found at depths ranging from 71 to 200 m and in bottom sediments dominated by coarse and medium sands. The effect of disturbance by trawling on this echinoid was significant and clearly negative. Seabeds exposed to higher trawling disturbance showed lower values of urchin abundance and smaller urchins than areas with lower disturbance. Results of the present study confirm the initial hypothesis of the suitability of using this urchin as a bioindicator of trawling impact but only in areas with appropriate environmental conditions, highlighting the importance of attaining a wider knowledge on the essential habitat of the species.;"[Gonzalez-Irusta, J.

By equipping a pontoon trap with a rigid grid with vertical bars, a substantial proportion of the undersized herring can escape from the gear by swimming through the grid. However, it has not been clear whether or not the young fish are injured by their passage through a grid and what their fate is. The purpose of this study was to investigate the short term mortality of herring after passage through a grid. To capture young herring, a selection grid was mounted at the entrance to the fish chamber of a pontoon trap, so that only young herring (approximately 12-18 cm in length) could swim in. The trap was then closed and the herring were confined in the fish chamber for seven days before assessing survival rates. The same procedure was performed with control herring which were trapped without passing through any grid. The whole trial was repeated three times. On average about 7% of the young herring selected through a sorting grid died during the experiment. The results demonstrated that passing through a rigid grid did not affect the short term mortality of young herring during the seven days in captivity. The highest mortality (45%) was in fact observed in one of the control groups presumably in connection with extreme temperature fluctuations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The mortality was 28% at a crowding density of 221 kg m 23 and increased further with increasing density. Crowding densities,150 kg m 23 did not result in any additional mortality compared with the control group (0.9-2.0%). Smaller herring and herring with a lower condition factor were more vulnerable to the effects of crowding. Blood analyses showed a significant increase in cortisol, lactate, and blood ions in the crowded fish. Lactate returned to control levels 2 d post-stress, whereas cortisol and blood ion levels continued to increase during the 4-to 5-d monitoring period. Furthermore, plasma glucose appeared to be substantially reduced at the end of the trial, indicating that the herring were incapable of restoring homeostasis and were approaching energy exhaustion. These results provide important information about the crowding densities that can be tolerated in the purse-seine fisheries for herring and will benefit future development of guidelines for purse-seine slipping operations.;"[Tenningen, Maria; Vold, Aud] Inst Marine Res, Fish Capture Grp, N-5817 Bergen, Norway; [Olsen, Rolf Erik] Inst Marine Res, Anim Welf Grp, N-5984 Matre, Matredal, Norway";;Tenningen, M (corresponding author), Inst Marine Res, Fish Capture Grp, POB 1870 Nordnes, N-5817 Bergen, Norway.;maria.tenningen@imr.no;;Olsen, Rolf/0000-0001-7523-3165;Norwegian Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs;We are grateful for the help and support of the crew of the purseseiners FV 'Mogsterhav' and FV 'Mogsterfjord'.

The economic data uses information taken from logbooks and auctions for the period 2004-2006; while biological data is based on information taken from on-board sampling carried out in the same period. In order to identify m tiers (homogeneous groups of fishing activity), a three-step process has been applied. Firstly, multivariate regression trees (MRT) are applied to obtain homogeneous groups which explain the inner structure of data by means of independent variables. Secondly, a list of specialized vessels is derived from each group obtained. Finally, an interview program is carried out with a representative number of skippers selected from the specialized vessels, who were asked about their fishing strategy, including target species. The results permitted identification of six metiers, taking into account the target species, which were, respectively: hake and deep-water species (OTB1), megrim (OTB2), hake (OTB3). Norway lobster (OTB4), a mixture of several species (OTB5), and anglerfish (OTB6). The combined use of both economic and biological data sources facilitates improved understanding of fleet activity: logbooks provide a comprehensive overview, while the scientific data from on-board sampling programs provide an ecological perspective to better contextualize the effects of fishing activity on the ecosystem.

Birds and fisheries concentrated in the same areas. Vulnerability and potential conflict were highest during winter and spring in coastal waters and around shallow offshore grounds. Local bycatch studies validated the usefulness of our approach, which can provide a valuable tool for conservation purposes. Although the conflict analysis outlined the current extent of overlap between birds and fisheries, the vulnerability index indicated important areas and periods in terms of diving bird abundance, irrespective of fisheries, and enabled the development of appropriate conservation and management options. A suite of measures including temporal or spatial restrictions can be derived, despite a scarcity of real data for bycatch rates. This approach is particularly useful for assessing impacts that are difficult to monitor and where mortality cannot be properly addressed, as in artisanal gillnet fisheries. It is also generally applicable to any marine area or species worldwide.;"[Sonntag, Nicole; Schwemmer, Henriette; Garthe, Stefan] Univ Kiel, Res & Technol Ctr FTZ, D-25761 Busum, Germany; [Fock, Heino Ove] Inst Sea Fisheries, Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst vTI, D-22767 Hamburg, Germany; [Bellebaum, Jochen] Inst Angew Okol GmbH, D-18184 Neu Broderstorf, Germany";;Sonntag, N (corresponding author), Univ Kiel, Res & Technol Ctr FTZ, Hafentorn 1, D-25761 Busum, Germany.;sonntag@ftz-west.uni-kiel.de;;;;;51;23;23;0;38;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;1054-3139;1095-9289;ICES J MAR SCI;ICES J.

We address this issue by examining the data collected within the Danish discard observer program and describe the factors that influence discarding within the Danish Kattegat demersal fleet over the period 1997 to 2008. Generalised additive models were used to assess how discards of the 3 main target species, Norway lobster, cod and plaice, and their subcomponents (under and over minimum landings size) are influenced by important factors and their potential relevance to management. Our results show that discards are influenced by a range of different factors that are different for each species and portion of discards.

The study was conducted using the covered codend method. Data were analysed taking between-haul variations into account. Results showed that changing from a 40D to 48D codend significantly improved mean L50 values, with increases of about 22% for hake, 8% for greater forkbeard, 20% for blackbelly rosefish, and 11% for four-spot megrim (P = 0.000). A change from diamond to square mesh configuration with the same 40 mm netting also significantly increased the mean L50 values, with 45% for hake, 36% for greater forkbeard, and 25% for blackbelly rosefish (P = 0.000). For four-spot megrim the mean L50 value was about 10% lower, but this difference was statistically insignificant (P > 0.05).

An assessment of 4 m beam trawl sampling between 2005 and 2008 following the granting of licences in 2006 is provided. The majority of fish species have shown marked reductions in abundance since commencement of dredging. Draghead entrainment has been identified as a possible contributory cause based upon the known vulnerability of selected species (Drabble, 2012). Other environmental factors considered offer no explanation for the changes in abundance. Comparative analyses with ICES data for plaice and sole over the study period demonstrate that changes in the ECR do not result from seasonal flux in the wider populations.

Entrainment evidence from hydraulic dredging studies is reviewed to develop a sensitivity index for benthic fish. Environmental monitoring attendant with the granting of new licences in the Eastern Channel Region (ECR) in 2006 offers a unique opportunity to assess the effects of dredging upon fish. Projected theoretical fish entrainment rates are calculated based upon: abundance data from 4m beam trawl sampling of fish species over the period 2005-2008; sensitivity data; and dredging activity and footprint derived from Electronic monitoring System (EMS) data. Results have been compared with actual entrainment rates and also against summary results from independent analysis of the changes in fish population over the period 2005-2008 (Drabble, 2012).

Experimental fishing with the grid demonstrated the possibility to capture Norway pout with only a minimum of unintended bycatch. Fishing with two different grid orientations, backwards and forwards-leaning, in distinct day and night hauls, resulted in an estimated release of between 88.4 and 100% of the total number of haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and whiting (Merlangius merlangus) entering the trawl. However, bycatch reductions were not significantly different between day and night or between grid orientations, indicating that the grid rejection of haddock and whiting is not influenced by fish behaviour. The loss of the target species, Norway pout, was low(between 5.6% and 13.7%) in comparison with the bycatch excluded, and clearly length dependent. Consequently, loss of target species would vary with the size structure of the population fished. Although results were not statistically significant, length-based analyses indicated that the grid rejection likelihood for particularly smaller Norway pout (<16 cm) was higher when fishing with the forwards-leaning grid during the night; this might be explained by behavioural and visual aspects of the fish-grid encounter process for Norway pout.";"[Eigaard, Ole Ritzau; Herrmann, Bent; Nielsen, J.

Acoustic-and trawl-survey data were combined with environmental data to predict the spatial distribution of (i) the acoustic backscattering of fish, (ii) the relative proportion of each species, and (iii) their mean length in the Gulf of Finland in the northeastern Baltic Sea. By combining the three spatial model layers, the spatial distribution of the biomass of each species was estimated. The model consists of a linear predictor on environmental variables and a spatial random effect given by a Gaussian process. A Bayesian approach is a natural choice for the task because it provides a theoretically justified means of summarizing the uncertainties from various model layers. In the study area, three species dominate pelagic waters: sprat (Sprattus sprattus), herring (Clupea harengus), and three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus).

Additional variables from the survey questionnaire were further used to validate and verify the outcome of the choice model. Commercial fishers in a mixed fishery make use of a number of decision variables used previously in the literature, but also a number of decision parameters rarely explicitly accounted for, such as price, weather, and management regulation. The seasonal availability of individual target species and within-year changes in monthly catch ration were the main explanatory drivers, but gillnetters were also responsive to information on the whole fishery, fish prices, and distance travelled to fishing grounds.

The variations of the chemical contents of the fish as a function of size, sex, organs and parts of the muscle were examined between December 2005 and May 2006. ANOVA indicated that the global chemical composition was significantly affected by two factors: species and body locations (parts of the muscle). The correlation matrix established between the chemical contents showed two highly significant correlations (fat - moisture and protein-ash). The discriminant analysis allowed the distribution in the space of fish species into five groups according to their moisture, proteins, fat and ash contents. The analysis of the fat content in the parts of the fish body revealed the presence of a concentration gradient.;"[Koubaa, Aida; Bouain, Abderrahmen] Fac Sci Sfax, Lab Biol Anim, Sfax, Tunisia; [Abdelmouleh, Abdelwaheb] Inst Natl Sci & Technol Mer, Biotechnol Lab, Sfax, Tunisia; [Mihoubi, Nourhene Boudhrioua] Ecole Natl Ingenieurs Sfax, Grp Genie Procedes Agroalimentaires, Sfax, Tunisia";;Koubaa, A (corresponding author), Fac Sci Sfax, Lab Biol Anim, BP 802, Sfax, Tunisia.;aydakouhaa@yahoo.fr;;;;;39;1;1;0;11;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;NEW YORK;32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA;0025-3154;1469-7769;J MAR BIOL ASSOC UK;J.

The nets used in bottom trawl fisheries cause mortality of benthic invertebrates and this can decrease the long-term availability of prey to exploited fish species by reducing the abundance of benthic invertebrates. This may have consequences for the sustainability of fisheries. 2. We assessed the impact of bottom trawling on the food availability of fish by comparing the condition of fish (as weight-at-length) in an area that had a steep commercial bottom-trawling gradient in the Irish Sea but otherwise homogeneous environmental conditions. 3. We found that the condition of the important commercial flatfish plaice Pleuronectes platessa was negatively related to trawling frequency, and this could be explained by a reduced production of the infaunal invertebrates they feed on. Density-dependent changes in competition over food could not explain this difference. No effect of trawling on the condition of the flatfish dab Limanda limanda was detected. Whiting Merlangius merlangus feeds primarily on fish, and therefore, no effect of bottom trawling on its condition was expected or detected. 4. This study therefore indicates that bottom trawl fisheries may have a negative effect on the condition of some of their target species, but not others, by reducing the abundance of their benthic prey. 5. Synthesis and application. Bottom trawls may indirectly affect the population size and growth rate of the target fish species and result in lower fishing yields. Such reductions in the yield and sustainability of fisheries are highly undesirable. The effects of bottom trawls may be mitigated by the modification of fishing gears or by minimizing the area of the seabed fished by bottom trawls.;"[Hiddink, Jan G.; Johnson, Andrew F.; Kingham, Rachel; Hinz, Hilmar] Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Anglesey, Wales";;Hiddink, JG (corresponding author), Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Anglesey, Wales.;J.Hiddink@bangor.ac.uk;"Hinz, Hilmar/AAH-7148-2019; Hiddink, Jan Geert/C-1238-2009";"Hinz, Hilmar/0000-0003-4909-0089; Hiddink, Jan Geert/0000-0001-7114-830X";;;38;55;56;1;63;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-8901;1365-2664;J APPL ECOL;J.

Applying this concept, we evaluated the capture of elasmobranchs in the presence of permanent magnets in hook-and-line and inshore longline fishing experiments. Hooks with neodymium-iron-boron magnets significantly reduced the capture of elasmobranchs overall in comparison with control and procedural control hooks in the hook-and-line experiment. Catches of Atlantic sharpnose shark (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae) and smooth dogfish (Mustelus canis) were significantly reduced with magnetic hook-and-line treatments, whereas catches of spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) and clearnose skate (Raja eglanteria) were not. Longline hooks with barium-ferrite magnets significantly reduced total elasmobranch capture when compared with control hooks. In the longline study, capture of blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus) and southern stingrays (Dasyatis americana) was reduced on magnetic hooks, whereas capture of sandbar shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus) was not affected. Teleosts, such as red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus), oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau), black sea bass (Centropristis striata), and the bluefish (Pomatomas saltatrix), showed no hook preference in either hook-and-line or longline studies. These results indicate that permanent magnets, although eliciting species-specific capture trends, warrant further investigation in commercial longline and recreational fisheries, where bycatch mortality is a leading contributor to declines in elasmobranch populations.;"[O'Connell, Craig P.; Abel, Daniel C.] Coastal Carolina Univ, Conway, SC 29526 USA; [O'Connell, Craig P.; Stroud, Eric M.; Rice, Patrick H.] SharkDef Technol LLC, Oak Ridge, NJ 07438 USA; [Rice, Patrick H.] Florida Keys Community Coll, Key West, FL 33040 USA";;O'Connell, CP (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts Dartmouth, Sch Marine Sci & Technol, New Bedford, MA 02740 USA.;coconnell2@umassd.edu;;;"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [GK-12]; Professional Association of Diving Instructors Foundation; Slocum-Lunz Foundation";We thank Coastal Carolina University and the George-town County Environmental Protection Society for providing us with the RV Brooks McIntyre.

The Gulf of Castellammare (NW Sicily), where trawling has been banned since 1990, is a good site to study the biology and dynamics of low impacted fish populations. A total of 661 (595 female and 66 male) specimens of red mullet Mullus barbatus (95-245 mm total length, TL) obtained by monthly sampling from trammel net artisanal fishery, was collected in the Gulf of Castellammare from April 2006 to June 2007. Mature females occurred from April to September, with a peak in May. The mean Gonado-somatic index (GSI) also showed a May peak for both sexes. From Sagittae (642) readings the age structure ranged from age class I to VII in females and I to V in males. Female growth parameters, estimated according to the classic von Bertalanffy model, were: L-infinity = 221.2 +/- 11.51 mm standard error (SE), k(y)(-1) = 0.38 +/- 0.09 SE, t(0)(y) = -0.94 +/- 0.38 SE. The growth performance index (circle divide' = 2.27) was included in the range of values obtained by hard structure readings in the Central Mediterranean. Natural mortality (M-y(-1)) of females estimated by different methods ranged between 0.62 and 0.87 (mean value = 0.71 +/- 0.06 SE).;"[Sieli, G.; Badalucco, C.; Rizzo, P.; Fiorentino, F.] CNR, Ist Ambiente Marino Costiero, Mazara Del Vallo, TP, Italy; [Di Stefano, G.; D'Anna, G.] CNR, Ist Ambiente Marino Costiero, Castellammare Del Golfo, TP, Italy";;Fiorentino, F (corresponding author), CNR, Ist Ambiente Marino Costiero, Mazara Del Vallo, TP, Italy.;fabio.fiorentino@iamc.cnr.it;"D'Anna, Giovanni/B-7995-2015; Fiorentino, Fabio/AAX-2883-2020";"D'Anna, Giovanni/0000-0002-8644-8222; ";;;64;16;17;1;23;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0175-8659;1439-0426;J APPL ICHTHYOL;J.

Linear interpolation between hourly VMS recordings underestimated trawl trajectories by 15%. The median haulwise difference between the VMS and the GPS trajectories was similar to 500 m. The interpolated VMS data are appropriate for mapping the large-scale distribution of fishing effort and the area impacted, but to link fishing activities with small-scale mapping of benthos, more-frequent VMS-update times and more-refined interpolation techniques are required.;"[Skaar, K.

A statistical procedure is proposed to highlight samples, trips (with multiple samples), or vessels (which may have multiple trips within a year) where extreme mean lengths of discarded fish were observed. Randomization methods were used to test for evidence of non-randomness in patterns of highlighted discard samples, e.g. repeated observations of extreme mean lengths for consecutive discard samples across trips from the same vessel. European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), common dab (Limanda limanda), grey gurnard (Eutrigla gurnardus), and whiting (Merlangius merlangus) were considered because these were the most abundant species in most of the discard samples. A linear mixed model was used to estimate random-sample effects on the estimated mean lengths by species. These random effects were incorporated into uni- and bivariate procedures to identify extreme samples that were summed for each vessel, and the probability of observing such numbers was estimated. Excluding these samples from the dataset had marginal effects on estimated size distributions of fish.;"[Uhlmann, Sebastian S.; Bierman, Stijn M.; van Helmond, Aloysius T.

Discards of the main demersal species (cod, haddock, whiting, and saithe) have been sampled according to a stratified design based on gear, area, and month, with quota sampling used to select vessels. The aim of the programme is to estimate the quantity (at age) of the discarded component of the catch, to contribute to estimates of total catch for these species so that assessments of each stock can be made. Trends of discards from this observer programme from 1987 to 2009 are reported. Notable features include the sudden practice of discarding marketable cod in 2007. This was due to a number of factors including, paradoxically, improvements in compliance measures which meant that fish could no longer be landed illegally. Methods for raising the sampled discards to the level of the fleet are also explored and discussed in relation to changes in discarding patterns. These are particularly relevant at a time when, in northern Europe at least, there is a move towards standardizing methods for estimating total quantities of discards.;"[Fernandes, Paul G.] Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, Scotland; [Coull, Kenny; Davis, Craig; Clark, Peter; Catarino, Rui; Bailey, Nick; Fryer, Rob; Pout, Alastair] Marine Scotland Sci, Marine Lab, Aberdeen AB11 9DB, Scotland";;Fernandes, PG (corresponding author), Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, Scotland.;fernandespg@abdn.ac.uk;Fernandes, Paul/H-2972-2013;Fernandes, Paul/0000-0003-4135-115X;;;41;25;25;0;18;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;1054-3139;1095-9289;ICES J MAR SCI;ICES J.

One site was located in a heavily exploited fishing ground. The second site was enclosed in the fishing ground but had not been trawled in twenty years. The third site was located adjacent to a marine protected area and was subjected to occasional trawling. The fourth site was located inside the marine protected area, where trawling was banned thirty years ago. Side-scan sonar records of trawl marks on the seabed confirmed the gradient of trawling intensity. We investigated the response of benthic fauna to trawling disturbance at the mesoscale of a fishing ground. We compared the observed patterns of abundance, biomass, diversity and community structure for epifauna and infauna with responses predicted from previous studies. Results showed that those communities less impacted by trawling sustained more biogenically habitat-structured communities (e.g. more abundance of sessile suspension feeders at the less disturbed sites against higher dominance of small invertebrates at the disturbed site). Moreover, these results confirm the benefits of restricting trawling activities for benthic communities, with marine reserves as the paradigm for the conservation of Mediterranean fishing grounds.;"[De Juan, Silvia; Demestre, Montserrat; Sanchez, Pilar] CSIC, ICM, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain";;De Juan, S (corresponding author), CSIC, ICM, Passeig Maritim de la Barceloneta 37-49, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain.;sdejuan@icm.csic.es;"Demestre, Montserrat/M-1719-2014; de Juan Mohan, Silvia/P-2899-2019";"Demestre, Montserrat/0000-0003-2866-4821; de Juan Mohan, Silvia/0000-0002-8891-8371";EUEuropean Commission [Q5RS-2002-00787, CTM2007-29845-E/MAR, CTM2008-04617/MAR];"We thank all the participants in the Response project and on the Veda and Medes cruises.

Four different codends were used in the sea trials. The nominal mesh sizes tested were 48 mm and 56 mm and two different nominal circumferences were associated with each mesh size. Selectivity experiments were carried out in the Central Adriatic Sea, in the course of two different periods of the year (May and September 2005) on two different fishing grounds normally exploited by local fishermen. Reliable selectivity results were obtained for red mullet (Mullus barbatus), little squid (Alloteuthis media) and European hake (Merluccius merluccius). For all the species, the codend circumference plays a role which is as important as mesh size. The positive effect of increasing mesh size, from 48 mm to 56 mm, could be made fruitless by an increase in codend circumference. According to species, the change only in the mesh size from 48 mm to 56 mm significantly increases L50 by + 15-42%, while by increasing only the codend circumference of around 13-17%, L50 decreases by 9-41%, thus being effective as by increasing mesh size. As a consequence the selection factor (i.e. SF is the ratio of L50 and the codend mesh size) depends on the codend circumference and does not result mesh-size-independent. We confirm that it is not sufficient to regulate selectivity in multispecies fisheries just by setting a minimum mesh size and that there is a need in mixed fisheries to improve selectivity by using additionally mechanisms. Possible solution would be to design policies and management programmes that seek to minimise discards, which include active rather than static management, obligations to land all catches, and no MLS and reduced benefits from landings of juvenile fish.

Considering both hydrographical and geomorphologic conditions, the study area was divided in four geographical sectors. Multivariate techniques were applied to identify assemblages and their main species, and to investigate the influence of environmental variables in the slope communities. Fishery-independent and fishery-dependent indicators were calculated, both at specific and community level, for the assemblages identified. In all cases, they were summarised using the Traffic Light approach. Three assemblages have been identified in the slope trawl fishing grounds off the Balearic Islands: (1) the almost unexploited shelf break, where teleosts predominate; (2) the upper slope, where teleosts still predominate but crustaceans are also very important (with Nephrops norvegicus as target species); (3) and the middle slope, where crustaceans predominate (with Aristeus antennatus as target species). Depth was the main factor affecting the species composition of the assemblages, although other factors such as area, year and effort level also affect. Indicators estimated from both sets of data suggested an improvement in the state of N. norvegicus, although the results suggest the influence of other factors than fishing impact in the state of this resource. For A. antennatus, marked differences have been found depending on the data source. In the upper slope, indicators suggested an improvement in the state of this assemblage, which can be related to a decreasing trend found in the fishing effort exerted in this depth range. Indicators from the middle slope showed differences for both sets of data. The characteristics of both data sources and of the species analysed are discussed as responsible of these differences.";"[Guijarro, Beatriz; Moranta, Joan; Massuti, Enric] Inst Espanol Oceanog, Ctr Oceanog Balears, Palma De Mallorca 07015, Spain; [Guijarro, Beatriz; Tserpes, George] Hellen Ctr Marine Res HCMR, Inst Marine Biol Resources, Iraklion 71003, Greece";;Guijarro, B (corresponding author), Inst Espanol Oceanog, Ctr Oceanog Balears, Moll Ponent S-N, Palma De Mallorca 07015, Spain.;beatriz@ba.ieo.es;"Guijarro, Beatriz/I-2480-2015; Massuti, Enric/AAG-5117-2021; Tserpes, George/L-6201-2013; Moranta, Joan/B-5522-2008";"Guijarro, Beatriz/0000-0002-2083-4681; Tserpes, George/0000-0001-9052-4091; Moranta, Joan/0000-0002-9814-0735; Massuti, Enric/0000-0002-9524-5873";"IEO; EUEuropean Commission; Marine Curie Research Training Network under the EU";The authors wish to thank to all the crew of the R/V Francisco de Paula Navarro and Cornide de Saavedra and all the participants who took part in the BALAR and MEDITS surveys.

With reference to the current situation, results suggested that implementation of the 1967/2006 EC Regulation, which bans bottom-trawl activities within 1.5 NM off the coast, will significantly increase (20-80%, depending on the species) the proportion of the populations that are inaccessible to the bottom-trawl fishery. It might also result in shifting of fishing activities toward deeper waters, adding fishing pressure onto slope resources inhabiting the slope. As depth determines, to a large extent, the distribution pattern of the species, it constitutes a variable of crucial importance for the spatial management of marine fisheries and should be taken into account when adopting relevant management regimes.;"[Tserpes, George; Tzanatos, Evangelos; Peristeraki, Panagiota] Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Iraklion 71003, Greece";;Tserpes, G (corresponding author), Hellen Ctr Marine Res, POB 2214, Iraklion 71003, Greece.;gtserpes@her.hcmr.gr;"Tserpes, George/L-6201-2013; Tzanatos, Evangelos/A-7693-2013";"Tserpes, George/0000-0001-9052-4091; Tzanatos, Evangelos/0000-0001-9972-9632";Greek Ministry of Agricultural Development and Food;This study has been supported by the Greek Ministry of Agricultural Development and Food.;30;13;13;1;12;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0018-8158;;HYDROBIOLOGIA;Hydrobiologia;JUL;2011;670;1;;;;267;274;;10.1007/s10750-011-0667-7;;;8;Marine & Freshwater Biology;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Marine & Freshwater Biology;772GQ;WOS:000291222700016;;;;;10/01/2022

Recovery was assessed as the return of a dredged assemblage to a state found in neighbouring undisturbed (reference) sites. in situ sediment screening was permitted during dredging operations; a difference in the sedimentary profile of the seabed between dredged and undisturbed reference sites was also observed. At sites of relatively high and low dredging intensity the sediment appeared more homogenous than reference sites after the selective removal of the coarser component. Initial assessment of the macrofaunal assemblage using univariate analytical techniques suggested a recovery of functional diversity at the low dredging intensity site after two years (according to the Infaunal Trophic Index, Taxonomic Distinctness index and Rao's Quadratic Entropy coefficient). However, multivariate analyses of the same data and of all indices except Taxonomic Distinctness indicated that assemblages at both high and low dredging intensity sites remained statistically indistinguishable from each other yet markedly different to the assemblage present in the reference area during the four-year study. The study concluded that recovery of functional diversity to a level found in a neighbouring undredged habitat had not occurred at either dredged site five years after the cessation of dredging. It is thought that the damage by dredging to functional diversity and to the capacity of the macrofaunal assemblage to recover is immediate and not so dependent on dredging intensity. The cumulative and wider ranging effects of sediment screening cannot be ignored or dismissed as a contributing factor to the similarities observed. The wider significance of these findings on the regulation of dredging activities is discussed. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.";"[Frojan, Christopher R. S.

We studied the morphological characteristics of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and haddock (Melano-grammus aeglefinus) in the Barents Sea bottom trawl fishery. The differences between the L-50 values (i.e., the size at which a fish has a 50% chance of being retained) that were recorded for the two species during sea trials can to a large extent be explained by the morphological differences between them. Because of these morphological differences, L-50 is always larger for cod than for haddock with the grid and codend setup commonly used in the area. While catch separation of cod and haddock is a management objective in the Barents Sea, we demonstrate that the morphological differences between the species and the grid and codend setup in force today limit achievable differences in L-50 to 5.5 cm. Furthermore, we show that for this fishery, the scope for increasing L-50 differences between these species by changing the mesh shape configuration of the codend is minimal.;"[Sistiaga, Manu; Larsen, Roger B.] Univ Tromso, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Herrmann, Bent] Tech Univ Denmark DTU, N Sea Ctr, DK-9850 Hirtshals, Denmark; [Nielsen, Kare N.] GenOk Ctr Biosafety, N-9294 Tromso, Norway";;Sistiaga, M (corresponding author), Univ Tromso, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.;Manu.Sistiaga@sintef.no;Larsen, Roger B./AAY-4314-2021;Herrmann, Bent/0000-0003-1325-6198;;;24;28;29;0;9;CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS;OTTAWA;1200 MONTREAL ROAD, BUILDING M-55, OTTAWA, ON K1A 0R6, CANADA;0706-652X;;CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI;Can.

Similarly, fishing vessels exit depending on their economic viability (or reduced expectations of future benefits) or encouraged by schemes such as decommissioning grants and/or when there is consolidation of fishing effort within a tradable rights-based quota system (e.g. individual transferable quotas). The strategic decision-making behaviour of fishers in entering or exiting the English North Sea beam trawl fishery is analysed using a discrete choice model by integrating data on vessel characteristics with available cost data, decommissioning grant information, and other factors that potentially influence anticipated benefits or future risks. It is then possible to predict whether operators choose to enter, stay, exit, or decommission. Important factors affecting investment include vessel age and size, future revenues, operating costs (e.g. fuel), stock status of the main target species, and the impact of management measures (e. g. total allowable catches) and total fleet size (a proxy for congestion). Based on the results, the predicted marginal effects of each factor are presented and the impact of each is discussed in the context of policies developed to align fleet capacity with fishing opportunities.;"[Tidd, Alex N.] Cefas, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England; [Hutton, Trevor] CSIRO, EcoSci Precinct, Brisbane, Qld 4102, Australia; [Kell, Laurence T.] ICCAT Secretariat, Madrid 28002, Spain; [Padda, Gurpreet] Defra, Area 2D, London SW1P 3JR, England";;Tidd, AN (corresponding author), Cefas, Pakefield Rd, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England.;alex.tidd@cefas.co.uk;Hutton, Trevor/E-3066-2017;Hutton, Trevor/0000-0002-8747-6196;"Commission of the European CommunitiesEuropean Commission [022644];  [MF1201]";The study was carried out with partial financial support from the Commission of the European Communities, CAFE project (DG-Fish contract EC FP6 022644), and Defra contract MF1201, supporting the PhD studies of the first author at Imperial College, London.

Total biomass, species richness, and to a lesser extent, maximum length and percentage of large fish, were sensitive to exclusion of trawling. Density, diversity and average trophic level did not show this sensitivity. The main species profiting from trawl exclusion were seabreams (Sparidae), catsharks and skates (Elasmobranchii), red mullets (Mullidae), gurnards (Triglidae) and John Dory (Zeus faber). Conversely, the main fishery target species (hake, anglerfish and megrim) showed a progressive decrease in abundance during the study period, a pattern which was also shown by their total stock biomass in the totality of the shelf area. Sea urchins, cephalopods and gastropods also increased in relative abundance with trawl exclusion. Reef age was identified as a key factor in reef development. After reef deployments, two periods were identified: (1) a recovery period, in which total biomass increased, mainly as a consequence of the increase in generalist species (e. g. catsharks); and (2) a consolidation period, during which biomass increased again, mainly as a consequence of an increase in specialized stenoic species (e. g. sparids), while biomass of generalist species remained constant or declined.";"[Serrano, Alberto; Rodriguez-Cabello, Cristina; Sanchez, Francisco; Velasco, Francisco; Olaso, Ignacio; Punzon, Antonio] Inst Espanol Oceanog, Lab Santander, Santander 39004, Spain";;Serrano, A (corresponding author), Inst Espanol Oceanog, Lab Santander, Promontorio San Martin S-N, Santander 39004, Spain.;aserrano@st.ieo.es;"Punzon, Antonio/AAC-6717-2020; Velasco, Francisco/S-3229-2016";Velasco, Francisco/0000-0002-6420-9474;;;34;9;9;0;25;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;NEW YORK;32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA;0025-3154;;J MAR BIOL ASSOC UK;J.

Our working hypothesis intended to assess the development of physiological impairment due to air exposure during sorting operations, and the possible recovery trajectories after the return to sea of this by-caught species. The protocol we used included experimental trawling and quantification of physiological stress indicators (haemolymph concentrations of L-lactate, D-glucose, ammonia and pH) under different seasonal conditions. Immediately after being caught, when the fishing net was emptied on board, L. depurator showed higher physiological imbalance in the summer vs. winter experiments, highlighting the immediate effect of temperature shock due to the difference in temperature between the sea bottom and the deck (15-18 and 2 degrees C in summer and winter, respectively). Experimental animals in the permanently emersed condition exhibited a progressive disruption of homeostasis in both seasons, as confirmed by a significant increase in lactate and a decrease in the pH of the haemolymph as a function of the emersion time. Ammonia levels were almost stable in the summer, when the physiological limits of this metabolite were reached immediately after animals were caught. In the winter, a significant increase in ammonia was observed over the time. This pattern can be attributed to the impairment of gill function, resulting in suffocation (manifested by marked haemolymph acidosis) and reduced ammonia excretion. Glucose concentration was revealed to be stable during air exposure in both seasons, though a higher concentration was recorded in the summer compared to the winter. The recovered individuals tended to return to pre-caught values for all of the haemolymph parameters we measured, though with different trajectories in the two seasons. From these results, we conclude that temperature shock, coupled with air exposure, influenced the ultimate stress level of this species to a greater extent than other effects of fishing.;"[Giomi, F.; Di Muro, P.; Beltramini, M.] Univ Padua, Dept Biol, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Raicevich, S.; Giovanardi, O.] Ist Super Protez & Ric Ambientale, ISPRA, I-30015 Venice, Italy; [Pranovi, F.] Univ Ca Foscari, Enviromental Sci Informat & Stat Dept, I-30122 Venice, Italy";;Beltramini, M (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Biol, Viale G Colombo 3, I-35131 Padua, Italy.;mariano.beltramini@unipd.it;Di Muro, Paolo/F-5811-2013;"Raicevich, Sasa/0000-0002-9323-031X; Giovanardi, Otello/0000-0002-3171-9099";"Italian Ministry of Agricultural Policies (DG Fisheries and Aquaculture) [Pr. 5A34]; University of Padova [60A06-1337/05]";F.

In Greece. a small portion of the chondrichthyan catch is marketed, 60% of which is produced by otter bottom trawls while other, more valuable species are targeted, and a large portion is usually discarded. A 10-year study in the Aegean Sea, divided into two sub-periods (1995-2000: 2003-2006) and based on bottom trawl fishery data, retroactively identified a total of 30 species making up 14.3% of the total catch in weight and 2.2% in number. A significant decrease in the chondrichthyan species richness, accompanied by an analogous decline in their abundance (catch composition and catch rate), was the most striking outcome. Species richness declined by an average of 0.66 species per year, and one third of the species collected during the earlier part of the study were absent from recent catches. Catch per unit of effort (CPUE) estimates in the mid-2000s were only half those in the mid-1990s. Although most species displayed a downward trend. certain Raja species displayed increased CPUE values in the recent years. More than 90% (in numbers) of the individuals caught were discarded at sea. The elasmobranch discards in the central Aegean included mainly Scyliorhinus canicula, Galeus melastomus and certain Raja species. It was clear that almost all the species were highly vulnerable since hatching due to the mesh currently in use, and there is a need to promote more selective gears. Although our findings provide signs of concern for the status of the chondrichthyan community in the study area, the processes influencing the population dynamics of the chondrichthyans are undoubtedly complex, and caution is needed in the interpretation of results. Further research based on surveys designed to place more emphasis on chondrichthyans is required and will contribute to the clarification of the observed trends. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this field study, floating fishing pots were equipped with 40, 45 and 50 mm square mesh escape windows in order to estimate the size selectivity of cod at different mesh sizes. Relationships between selectivity parameters and mesh size, as well as an optimal mesh size for the escape window with respect to current minimum landing size of cod in the Baltic Sea were sought. The results show that the floating pot is not only species selective when used in the Baltic Sea cod fishery, the implementation of an escape window reduced the proportion of undersized bycatch in the pots by more than 90%. The estimated length at 50% retention was found to be a direct function of fish body length (girth) and mesh size of the escape window, while the estimated selection range remained unchanged regardless of mesh size. Optimal mesh size, with respect to the length at 50% retention and current minimal landing size of 38 cm in the Baltic, was determined to be 45 mm. Strong indications (significant on the 0.01 probability level in the case of 50 and 40 mm escape windows) suggested that the relative fishing power of the pots increased with the implementation of an escape window. This result could be explained as a saturation effect, i.e. the probability of cod entering the pot is likely to be negatively dependent on cod density in the pot. The high species selectivity and the low catch rate of undersized fish have consolidated the floating pots position as a highly benign fishing method and the foremost alternative gear for the future coastal cod fishery in the Baltic Sea.

The data collection of commercial fisheries has been formalized by the EU data collection framework (DCF). Besides gaining relevant information to fisheries management under the Common Fisheries Policy, the data of the DCF will gain importance in assessing the impacts of fishing on the ecosystem of the Baltic Sea. Materials and methods. The catch of the demersal German Baltic Sea trawl fleet between 2006 and 2009 was sampled by on-board observers to investigate the temporal and spatial patterns in catch composition. Results. There was a general increment in tow duration, landing weights, and discard weights from west to east. The most important species by catch weight was cod, for which highest catches were obtained during spring in ICES subdivision 25. Single hauls exceeded 25 h and caught more than 9900 kg of cod. On average, about 5%, 13%, and 20% and of the captured cod, flounder, and dab, respectively, were discarded. Conclusion. The presently reported study provides a benchmark for the German Baltic Fisheries that can be used for assessment of new management regulations and/or new marine policies. A comprehensive documentation of the spatial and temporal catch distribution of the German Baltic demersal trawl fleet, prior to the implementation of marine spatial planning measures such as marine protected areas or offshore wind farms, should help to evaluate the implications of intensifying spatial use on the fishing industry.;"[Probst, Wolfgang N.] Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, Inst Seefischerei, D-22767 Hamburg, Germany; [Probst, Wolfgang N.; Berth, Ulrich; Stepputtis, Daniel; Hammer, Cornelius] Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, Inst Balt Sea Fisheries, D-18069 Rostock, Germany";;Probst, WN (corresponding author), Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, Inst Seefischerei, Palmaille 9, D-22767 Hamburg, Germany.;nikolaus.probst@vti.bund.de;;Stepputtis, Daniel/0000-0003-4824-1631;European Union (EC)European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre;This study was partly funded by the European Union within the data collection framework (EC, 2000).

Because of fleet renewal and trawl-size changes, the relationship between nominal effort data as recorded in logbooks (days fishing) and effective effort is likely to have changed, so to standardize the nominal lpue time-series, trawl-size development has been taken into account using generalized linear modelling. As logbooks do not provide trawl-size information, this standardization was made possible by retrieving technical trawl and vessel data from industry order books. These data demonstrated an approximately linear relationship between vessel engine power and Pandalus trawl size, so validated the use of vessel horsepower from the logbooks as a proxy for an unknown trawl size. Standardized lpue time-series for the past 20 years indicated a lesser increase in stock size than nominal lpue, the modelling results demonstrating that vessel lpue increased by 9.5% with each 100 hp of engine power.;"[Eigaard, Ole Ritzau; Munch-Petersen, Sten] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, DK-2920 Charlottenlund, Denmark";;Eigaard, OR (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, DK-2920 Charlottenlund, Denmark.;ore@aqua.dtu.dk;;Eigaard, Ole Ritzau/0000-0003-4213-2397;EU through CAFE [022644];The work was partly funded by the EU's DG Fisheries through the CAFE project (contract 022644).

Using generalized linear models, the impact of technical and anthropogenic factors was evaluated using landings per unit effort (lpue) obtained from logbooks. Variations in hake lpue were explained primarily by anthropogenic factors. For studying the biological components of catchability, the results of a scientific trawl survey in July 2006 involving three similar trawlers of the French trawler fleet were used. Daytime accessibility to large hake was lower than at night, and about zero for small hake (<19 cm). Estimates of spatial variation made using generalized linear mixed models showed a patchy fine-scale spatial distribution, but a random larger-scale distribution of hake over the area surveyed.;"[Mahevas, Stephanie; Trenkel, Verena M.; Doray, Mathieu; Peyronnet, Arnaud] IFREMER, Dept EMH, F-44311 Nantes 3, France";;Mahevas, S (corresponding author), IFREMER, Dept EMH, Rue Ile Yeu,BP 21105, F-44311 Nantes 3, France.;stephanie.mahevas@ifremer.fr;Doray, Mathieu/I-6011-2019;"Doray, Mathieu/0000-0001-6498-3366; Trenkel, Verena/0000-0001-7869-002X";"European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [022644]; European funding scheme IFOP [15486/2006]";We thank the skippers and the crews of the FVs Davidson, Hebeilan, and Oceanie for their active involvement and contributions, and our colleagues from Ifremer who participated in the survey.

Throughout the past decade considerable efforts have been devoted to research on improving both species and size selectivity of the trawls used in the mixed demersal fishery in the area, because this provides a valuable management tool for reducing the bycatch of cod and reducing mortality, and thus helping to rebuild the depleted stock. Gear research in the area has been focused on devices that allow for continued exploitation of the Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) and flatfish, but minimizing the bycatch. We review the results of previous and continuing experiments with various codend mesh sizes, mesh configurations, escape windows, sorting grids, sorting frames, and separator panels, but also changes in whole-trawl designs. Based on our review, we compare and discuss the gear-related technical measures and their effectiveness in maintaining a commercial fishery on viable stocks, yet protecting cod. We discuss the results in relation to changes in legislation and experience with implementation of new selective devices in recent years. We also discuss ways to create stronger incentives for fishers to participate in gear research and to increase acceptance of more selective gears.;"[Madsen, Niels] Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Aqua, DK-9850 Hirtshals, Denmark; [Valentinsson, Daniel] Swedish Board Fisheries, Inst Marine Res, S-45321 Lysekil, Sweden";;Madsen, N (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Aqua, N Sea Sci Pk,POB 101, DK-9850 Hirtshals, Denmark.;nm@aqua.dtu.dk;;"Valentinsson, Daniel/0000-0003-0456-3436; Madsen, Niels/0000-0002-4409-1122";;;60;30;30;0;25;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;1054-3139;1095-9289;ICES J MAR SCI;ICES J.

Untangling the effects of broad-scale anthropogenic stressors is complicated as appropriate unimpacted areas at relevant scales are usually unavailable for contrast with impacted regions. Although the perfect study design in the traditions of small-scale manipulative experiments may not always be possible, many human impacts and the mechanisms associated with ecosystem responses have been highlighted in literature allowing contrasting predictions on expected patterns to be tested. We applied such an approach to the Marine Protected Area of Bergeggi (Ligurian Sea, NW Mediterranean). Our study aimed at assessing the effects of recreational angling (a presumed chronic stress) on the recovery of epibenthic communities following historical date-mussel harvesting (an extreme disturbance) by making and testing alternative predictions on the structure of epibenthic communities that should be apparent depending on the importance of specific mechanisms. Effects of date-mussel harvesting were still visible 20 years after its cessation, mostly because recovery is hampered by persistent sea-urchin grazing. We hypothesized that fish biomass removal by angling favours high sea urchin abundance. Based on these premises, we assembled information on angling pressure, sea urchin abundance and substratum cover by different trophic guilds to test our predictions. Our study indicates that the interaction between date-mussel harvesting and angling produced a shift, from autotrophic-dominated to consumer-dominated communities as a consequence of cascading trophic effects. Such an outcome implies that chronic recreation fishing pressure is blocking recovery in locations previously impacted by date-mussel harvesting. Testing predictions proved efficient in describing the interaction among stressors when system history is known and represents a valuable approach to provide scientifically sound insight for improved conservation management.

Trawling effects vary with habitat; impact and recovery time are typically greater for more complex substrates/communities and those with lower rates of natural disturbance. Benthic organisms represent the prey base of a large component of the demersal fish assemblage. Hence, trawling-induced change in benthic community structure and function may exert an indirect effect on feeding success and growth of important commercially exploited fishes such as plaice Pleuronectes platessa. We present habitat-specific mixed effects models of plaice length as a function of age, bottom-trawling effort, population density and near-bottom temperature, with sampling year and area, and fish sex incorporated as random effects. Across an observed gradient of trawling effort in the Celtic Sea, plaice on gravel habitat showed significant declines in length at age while plaice on sand habitat showed significant increases in length at age. Contrasting trawling effects likely reflect dietary differences between habitats. Plaice on sand substrates are known to consume predominately polychaetes, which may proliferate at moderate trawling intensity in this habitat. Conversely, plaice on gravel substrates are reported to consume more of the fragile organisms such as echinoderms and bivalves that show marked declines with bottom trawling. An indirect effect of trawling on prey availability and growth of demersal fish has substantial implications for fisheries sustainability via reduced ecosystem carrying capacity and production of commercial fish.";"[Shephard, Samuel; Brophy, Deirdre] Galway Mayo Inst Technol, Dept Life Sci, Commercial Fisheries Res Grp, Galway, Ireland; [Reid, David G.] Inst Marine, Galway, Ireland";;Shephard, S (corresponding author), Galway Mayo Inst Technol, Dept Life Sci, Commercial Fisheries Res Grp, Dublin Rd, Galway, Ireland.;samuel.shephard@gmit.ie;Reid, David/ABC-5916-2021;"Brophy, Deirdre/0000-0003-4111-762X; Reid, Dave/0000-0002-8494-0918";Department of Education Ireland;This study relied on data from the Irish Groundfish Survey, being supplied by the Irish Marine Institute.

The influence of some environmental variables (sea surface temperature, wind speed, NAO index) and some fishing effort indices (fishing days, mean size and mean engine power of the trawl vessels) was analysed as well. The species considered for the study were Eledone cirrhosa, Merluccius merluccius, Mullus barbatus. Nephrops norvegicus and Parapenaeus longirostris. From 1991 to 2006, the mean monthly landing rates were computed from the data collected at the auction of Porto Santo Stefano, the most important fishing harbour in the area. A second data set was represented by trawl survey data: two experimental trawl surveys per year have been carried out in the framework of national and international programs on the assessment of demersal resources. The mean biomass (kg/km(2)) indices were calculated. The time series analyses were carried out by means of Min/Max Auto-correlation Factor Analysis (MAFA) and Dynamic Factor Analysis (DFA). The two techniques provided coherent results, indicating that the two most important trends in the response variables are an increase in terms of both LPUE and survey biomass index, and a fluctuating pattern, even though characterized by a general increasing tendency. What drove these trends is less clear, even though the available evidence suggests that the reduction of fishing effort has been more important than environmental factors. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A multidisciplinary study of trawl and sea snail fisheries in Samsun, Black Sea coast of Turkey;OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT;English;Article;;;;;;;"DPSIR APPROACH; MANAGEMENT; CATCHMENT";This study aims to investigate and model driving forces that lead to increased fishing pressure and an altered state of the environment in the coastal areas near Samsun on the Turkish Black Sea coast. We have applied a modified DPSIR model to structure our investigation and analysis and have investigated the drivers that generate fishing pressure in the Samsun fisheries. The overall health of the ecosystem is declining, and there is a consistent trend of deterioration in the condition of the three major species targeted by the trawl fisheries. Although introduced invasive species have brought significant changes to the Black Sea, it is clear that the state of the environment is significantly and negatively affected by the pressure exerted by fisheries. Fishing pressure has to a certain extent been redirected to pelagic trawling as bottom trawling has become less profitable and a rise in catch capacity has levelled off. This reduction is, however, offset by an increase in illegal trawling and dredging by a very rapidly growing sector of multi-purpose small boats, resulting in a considerable increase in the overall accumulated engine power of fishing boats in Samsun during 2000-2005. Fisheries in Samsun, in particular sea snail fisheries, have constituted a frontier of sorts open to the poorer populations of Samsun during the last 20 years, and, thereby, constitute one of the major drivers for fishing pressure. We identify eight drivers of importance for the period 2000-2005. Although the authorities can impact all or most of those drivers, most of them are beyond the scope of conventional 'fisheries management'. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was undertaken to analyse the effect on trawl selectivity of inserting first a 40 mm square-mesh codend and second of increasing the circumference in the diamond-mesh codend A traditional 40 mm diamond-mesh codend, typical of the commercial trawl fisheries, was selected as a reference codend for the comparative analysis The square-mesh codend was always more selective than the diamond-mesh codends, while the influence of codend circumference on diamond-mesh selectivity was less evident In addition to mesh configuration and the number of meshes around the codend. the selectivity data were modelled by estimating the individual contribution of catch size and season, but there was no evidence of a coherent effect on the selectivity of these two parameters This study confirms that all the four investigated species make the best use of the square-mesh opening, either because of their body shape or because the form of the mesh facilitates forcing of the net. Results seem to suggest that for the main target species. Norway lobster. square-mesh codend would protect specimens under the 20 mm of MLS (carapace length).

Catch composition is necessary for accurate quantitative allocation of acoustic energy to the different species present in the water column. For this purpose, the species composition in the trawl catch must be representative of the true species composition in the ocean, which requires that the catchability of the trawl for individual species is known. The catchability is expected to be trawl- and species-specific as a result of variations in fish behaviour in front of the trawl (fright reactions, swimming speeds and other factors) which can affect the chance of fish being caught or escaping. We show that catchability estimates for several species can be simultaneously derived from combined trawl-acoustic samples through a simple and straight- forward optimization method. We apply the method to estimate the catchability of two important pelagic species in the Norwegian Sea, beaked redfish (Sebastes mentella) and blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) when fished with a large pelagic trawl, the Gloria 2048.;"[Bethke, E.; Goetze, E.] Inst Seefischerei, Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, D-22767 Hamburg, Germany; [Planque, B.] Inst Marine Res, Tromso, Norway";;Bethke, E (corresponding author), Inst Seefischerei, Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, Palmaille 9, D-22767 Hamburg, Germany.;eckhard.bethke@vti.bund.de;Planque, Benjamin/D-2729-2013;"Planque, Benjamin/0000-0002-0557-7410; Bethke, Eckhard/0000-0002-4406-2217";;;23;3;3;0;6;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0175-8659;1439-0426;J APPL ICHTHYOL;J.

Most damage is caused by the rapidly growing grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) population. These seal-fishery interactions require practical and sustainable solutions. A potential measure is capture of live seals using fishers' commercial trap-nets. The benefit of this approach to fishers would be to catch nuisance seals that have learned to use commercial fishing gear for finding their food sources and to remove them in an ethical way while endangered species could be released. We developed a capture system that can easily be installed into a modern salmon trap-net, commonly referred to as the pontoon trap. The aim was to develop a technique that enables undisturbed fishing while allowing live-capture of seals. Development work involved the testing of various structures and recording the behaviour of seals and fish on video. This paper demonstrates the criteria for a successful trap design and presents some observations of seal behaviour. The technique developed provides a unique method for scientific studies where seals have to be captured alive. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Selectivity curves of two commercial (19 mm white twine and 19 mm black twine) and three experimental (23, 26 and 28 mm white twine) traps were estimated using SELECT method. In addition, theoretical size-selectivity curves were calculated from morphometric data using a simplified version of Sechin method. Differing from the opinion of fishermen, N. mutabilis did not show any preference for dark coloured twine. Retention curves estimated with SELECT method had a very sharp selectivity and well fitted catch Theoretical size-selectivity curves were very close to size-selectivity curves obtained data in all cases. from experimental data. The two types of curve were very similar in shape, although the theoretical ones were shifted towards larger size classes and showed a slightly steeper slope than SELECT curves. The mesh size commonly used by fishermen is not: adequate for rationally exploiting the resource, as catches mainly included undersized specimens, whilst the 23 and 26 mm mesh sizes would represent a good compromise between reduced occurrence of undersized individuals and satisfactory yields of commercial product.

VMS data are increasingly used by scientists to study spatial and temporal patterns of fishing activity and thus fishing impact (e.g. surface of sea bed trawled during a fishing trip). However, due to their low resolution (2 h basis), these data may provide a biased perception of fishing impact. We present here a method aiming at interpolating vessel trajectories from VMS data points to obtain higher-resolution data on vessel trajectories which in turn should provide improved estimates of the spatial and temporal patterns of fishing activity and hence fishing impact. This method is based on a spline interpolation technique, the cubic Hermite spline (cHs), using position, heading and speed to interpolate the trawl track of a vessel between two succeeding VMS data points. To take uncertainty of the interpolated track into account, the method also determines a confidence interval, which represents the spatial distribution of vessel presence probability between two successive VMS positions. The cHs method was compared to the straight line interpolation technique using a reference data set with intervals of 6 min which was assumed to represent the real trawl tracks. The results showed that the cHs method approximates the real trawl track markedly better than a straight line interpolation. The cHs method should therefore be preferred to the conventional straight line approach to interpolate vessel tracks in studies aiming at estimating fishing impact from VMS data.

Between 2006 and 2008, the Consorzio Nazionale Interuniversitario per le Scienze del Mare (CoNISMa) coordinated a monitoring programme of cetacean by-catch in Italian pelagic trawlers, funded in compliance with European Regulation 812/2004. Sixteen independent observers monitored a total of 3141 hauls. The observation coverage ranged between 0.9 and 6.3% of the regional fishing effort. Almost all by-catch events were recorded in the northern Adriatic Sea. By-catch rates of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) were 0.0006 and 0.0255 individuals per haul, respectively. Given the low number of observed deaths, reliable estimates of total mortality for these two species were not obtained. The annual number of by-caught turtles was 863 (CV = 0.15), with 99% released alive. A 'hotspot' for turtle captures was found off Goro (south Venice). The existence of lethal interactions makes it important to understand whether the scale of this mortality is sufficient to pose a threat at population level. Finally, annual by-catch estimates for rays and sharks were 5436 (CV = 0.08) and 5414 (CV = 0.15), respectively. Thintail threshers (Alopias vulpinus), piked dogfish (Squalus acanthias) and smooth-hounds (Mustelus mustelus), which are both commercial and vulnerable to overfishing, were taken in large numbers.;"[Fortuna, Caterina M.; Vallini, Carola; Filidei, Elio, Jr.; Ruffino, Marco; Consalvo, Ivan; Di Muccio, Stefano; Gion, Claudia; Scacco, Umberto; Tarulli, Enrico; Mazzola, Antonio] Consorzio Nazl Interuniv Sci Mare, Rome, Italy; [Fortuna, Caterina M.; Ruffino, Marco; Consalvo, Ivan; Di Muccio, Stefano; Gion, Claudia; Scacco, Umberto; Tarulli, Enrico; Giovanardi, Otello] ISPRA, Rome, Italy; [Vallini, Carola] ARCHE Onlus Res & Educ Act Chelonian Conservat, Ferrara, Italy; [Mazzola, Antonio] Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Ecol, Palermo, Italy";;Fortuna, CM (corresponding author), Consorzio Nazl Interuniv Sci Mare, Rome, Italy.;caterina.fortuna@isprambiente.it;"Scacco, Umberto/AAX-1963-2020; Fortuna, Caterina Maria/J-7796-2016";"Fortuna, Caterina Maria/0000-0003-3036-5337; Giovanardi, Otello/0000-0002-3171-9099";Italian DG Fishery [812/2004];This study was financed by the Italian DG Fishery within the Italian obligations to the Council Regulation (EC) 812/2004 and comprises data collected during two consecutive monitoring programmes: BY-CATCH I & II.

Since the beginning of Port 2000 construction in 2002, there have been several changes in the hydrological and sedimentary characteristics in the North Channel, including changes in current velocity, bottoms salinity and sand accumulation, as well as in the benthic communities themselves, moving from mud to medium and coarse sand communities. For the suprabenthos, changes were moderate, corresponding to an increase in species richness in the upper-part of the North Channel and a decrease in species density in the dominant mysids species (i.e., mainly Mesopodospsis slabberi) over time. Due to hydrological changes since the beginning of the Port 2000 project (several years of low freshwater input) it has been difficult to attribute the biological changes to Port 2000 construction only. In the future, the results obtained for the suprabenthos will have to be compared to those obtained for the macrobenthos. Similarly, since the suprabenthos is known to play an important role in the estuarine trophic chain, it will also be essential to estimate the fish distribution in the North Channel and to examine their stomach contents to evaluate the probable changes since the Port 2000 project began.

These artisanal nets interact with sea turtles. Here we present an analysis of the bycatch of loggerhead sea turtles Caretta caretta in these gillnets in the Gulf of Gabes, an important Mediterranean wintering and foraging area for this threatened species. We quantified mean catch per unit effort (CPUE) in three ways to account for uncertainty and found high levels of interaction in each case. The number of turtle captures per km(2) of gillnet per day, the number of turtle captures per km of net and the number of turtle captures per set were 0.527 (0.403-0.649), 0.339 (0.250-0.438) and 0.800 (0.654-0.904), respectively. Captured loggerheads were mainly juveniles (mean = 56.6cm CCLn-t) and direct mortality was estimated as 69.4% (n=25). These are the first estimates of sea turtle interactions with artisanal fisheries for northern Africa, and one of very few estimates of turtle mortality in set gillnets in the Mediterranean. Our results indicate a need for research into ways for fishermen to avoid turtle captures and to raise awareness of this problem throughout the Mediterranean Sea. The following specific actions are recommended: 1) management of gillnet fisheries in the Mediterranean Sea, 2) minimizing gear soak time, particularly in foraging and inter-nesting habitats and along the migration pathways of sea turtles, 3) technical modifications of the gear by reducing the number of floats, and 4) carrying out an awareness campaign with fishermen to reduce post-release mortality.;"[Echwikhi, Khaled; Bradai, Mohamed Nejmeddine] Natl Inst Sea Sci & Technol, Sfax 3018, Tunisia; [Echwikhi, Khaled; Jribi, Imed; Bouain, Abderrahmen] Sfax Fac Sci, Sfax, Tunisia";;Echwikhi, K (corresponding author), Natl Inst Sea Sci & Technol, POB 1035, Sfax 3018, Tunisia.;chouikhikhaled@yahoo.fr;;Jribi, Imed/0000-0002-2973-9568;;;38;20;23;0;19;BRITISH HERPETOL SOC;LONDON;C/O ZOOL SOC LONDON REGENTS PARK, LONDON NW1 4RY, ENGLAND;0268-0130;;HERPETOL J;Herpetolog.

The present study assessed the effects of commercial trawling on the trophodynamics and diet of pandora, Pagellus erythrinus, by comparing its stomach contents and stable-isotope (delta N-15 and delta C-13) composition in two trawled and two untrawled gulfs in northern Sicily (central Mediterranean). Fish were collected on muddy bottoms at 50-100-m depth. Higher abundance and biomass and a slightly larger mean body length were found in the untrawled gulfs. The feeding habits were similar although more selective in the untrawled gulfs. The diet was mainly composed of decapod crustaceans (especially the brachyuran crab Goneplax rhomboides) and of polychaetes. The trophic level of pandora, estimated by its delta N-15 values, was higher in the untrawled gulfs. No clear trend between trawled and untrawled gulfs was found for the source of carbon in the diet (delta C-13). The diet of a benthic feeder such as pandora may be used as an indirect indicator of trawling disturbance, as long as stomach contents and stable-isotope analysis are used jointly to assess the diet and trophodynamics of a species.;"[Fanelli, E.] CSIC, Inst Ciencias Mar, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain; [Fanelli, E.; Badalamenti, F.; D'Anna, G.; Pipitone, C.; Romano, C.] CNR IAMC, I-91014 Castellammare Del Golfo, TP, Italy";;Fanelli, E (corresponding author), CSIC, Inst Ciencias Mar, Passeig Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain.;efanelli@icm.csic.es;"Pipitone, Carlo/B-7562-2015; Romano, Chiara/AAJ-2517-2021; D'Anna, Giovanni/B-7995-2015; Romano, Chiara/D-7372-2014; Romano, Chiara/J-8979-2012; Fanelli, Emanuela/H-4412-2014; BADALAMENTI, FABIO/B-8508-2015";"Pipitone, Carlo/0000-0002-7632-1228; Romano, Chiara/0000-0001-5078-0082; D'Anna, Giovanni/0000-0002-8644-8222; Romano, Chiara/0000-0001-5078-0082; Fanelli, Emanuela/0000-0002-5358-5159; BADALAMENTI, FABIO/0000-0002-2395-454X";"Italian Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry [6A84/2003]; CNR IAMC";Samples from GCAST and GPATT analysed in this study were collected with permission of the Italian Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (Project No. 6A84/2003).

Most of the studies were focused on highly developed industrial fisheries, overlooking bycatch in small-scale artisanal fisheries. However, bycatch in smallscale fisheries might have negative effects similar to those of industrial fisheries when they overlap with hotspot areas of top predators. Moreover, different types of fishing gear coexist in the same oceanographic area, particularly in highly exploited marine ecosystems such as the western Mediterranean. We quantify for the first time the influence of trawling regime on Cory's shearwater Calonectris diomedea bycatch in the western Mediterranean longline artisanal fishery. The availability of trawling discards has substantial influence on the foraging and breeding ecology of many seabirds, and trawling inactivity may drive shearwaters to seek alternative food resources, such as baits used in longline fishing. Based on our previous knowledge of the system, we also tested other variables affecting bycatch over 8 yr (1998 to 2005). Within this 2-fishery framework, we found that trawling regime, longline fishing time and breeding stage were key factors explaining shearwater attendance to longline vessels, but mainly trawling regime and fishing time increased the incidental capture of Cory's shearwaters. More specifically, during the pre-breeding and chick-rearing periods, bycatch dramatically increased during sunrise sets in the absence of trawling activity. Importantly, this study indicates the need for an integrated multi-fisheries management approach for the conservation of seabirds and highlights the necessity of banning longline fishing during periods of trawling inactivity.;"[Louzao, M.] Univ Oviedo, Dept Biol Organismos & Sistemas, E-33071 Oviedo, Spain; [Arcos, J.

Seamount fish fauna have been described in several studies but few works have included species taken below 600 m. The demersal fish assemblages of the Seine and Sedlo seamounts (northeast Atlantic) from the summits to 2000 m depth were investigated based on longline survey catch data, conducted as part of the OASIS project. A total of 41 fish species from 24 families were caught at Seine near Madeira, and 30 species from 19 families were caught at Sedlo north of the Azores. Both fish faunas have high affinities with the neighbouring areas of the Azores, Madeira and with the eastern North Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. Overall abundances and mean body weights were slightly higher at Sedlo seamount, appearing in conformity with the latitudinal effect of increasing species abundance and productivity from south to north. The differential influence of the Mediterranean Water at each seamount may contribute to explain (a) the differences found in vertical distribution of common species, which tend to distribute deeper at Seine, and (b) the observed changes in the species composition and dominance in deeper waters. Multivariate analysis revealed a vertical structure that is approximately coincident with the expected zonation of water masses at each seamount. Physiological tolerance to the prevailing vertical hydrological conditions may explain the species distribution and the large-scale vertical assemblage structure found. However, further ecological factors like productivity patterns affecting the amount and quality of the available food appear to shape the abundance, diversity or dominance patterns of functional groups within those main assemblages. At Seine, the species Trachurus picturatus dominated the catches, mainly at the shallower edge of the plateau, appearing consistent with the sound-scattering layer interception hypothesis [Isaacs, J.D., Schwartzlose, R.A., 1965. Migrant sound scatterers: interaction with the sea floor. Science 150, 1810-1813]. At both seamounts mesopelagic feeders (e.g., Beryx splendens) dominate the upper-slope assemblages (<800 m), while the mid-slope assemblages (800-1200/1300 m) and the lower-slope assemblages (>1300 m) were dominated by squaliform species (e.g., Centrophorus squamosus, Centroscymnus coelolepis, Etmopterus princeps) along with Mora moro or the Antimora rostrata. The lower abundance of C squamosus observed at Seine may be a result of the fishing activities in the area, since the species is an important by-catch of the black-scabbard fish fishery in the Madeira archipelago. The slightly higher predominance of scavenger species at Seine in deeper assemblages may be the result of an ecological response favouring this functional group in lower productivity regimes. Especially relevant was the record of large reproductive aggregations of B. splendens and Epigonus telescopus found at the edge of the Sedlo plateau. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A climate crash during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) G6 (c. 2.74 Ma) resulted in the extinction of early-mid Pliocene thermophilic ostracods and the subsequent emergence of oligothermal assemblages during the late Pliocene. During the numerous cold stages of the late Pliocene-early Pleistocene Arctic ostracod species were able to disperse southwards into the mid-latitudes of the North Atlantic. The Pre-Ludhamian Stage of the Red Crag Formation, Suffolk, England spans one such episode (c. 2.7-2.41 Ma) and thus offers new insight into the vagility of shallow marine ostracods as they responded to glacio-eustatic and isostatic changes. Five podocopid ostracods are described from the Sizewell Member (Pre-Ludhamian Stage) of the Red Crag Formation and new information regarding their phylogeny and palaeozoogeography is presented. Four of the species are new to science, Microcytherura gelida sp. nov., Thaerocythere liebaui sp. nov., Thaerocythere russus sp. nov. and Pectocythere hollowayae sp. nov., while the fifth, Neomonoceratina tsurugasakensis (Tabuki), is reexamined and reassigned. The comparative morphology of Pectocythere Hanai and Kotoracythere Ishizaki is reviewed and a morphological continuum recognized between phenotypic end-members. Pectocythere hollowayae sp. nov. forms part of a distinctive morphological group comprising Arctic and northern Pacific species: P. ishizakii Irizuki and Yamada, Pectocythere? sp. cf. P.? dentarticulata (Smith) sensu Swain and Gilby, Kotoracythere sp. Irizuki, P. janae Brouwers and P. parkerae Swain and Gilby. Although lacking a distinctive caudal process, Paijenborchella tsurugasakensis Tabuki is reassigned to Neontonoceratina sensu Zhao and Whatley. Neontonoceratina tsurugasakensis displays some minor polymorphism over an enormous geo-temporal range that extends from the early Miocene of the northwestern Pacific to the late Pliocene-early Pleistocene of the southern North Sea Basin. Despite its lack of pelagic larvae N. tsurugasakensis was capable of transoceanic dispersal, evidenced by its occurrence in the early Pliocene (c.4.90-4.81 Ma), Oosterhout Formation, Western Netherlands Basin, alongside other pan-Arctic and North Pacific ostracod taxa. Mechanisms of dispersal remain unclear but could involve passive transport on Fucus brown algae, aided by the Transpolar Drift. Further agents of dispersion could include fish and birds. The viability of water birds as vectors of invertebrate dispersal is given further credence by the discovery of Phoebastria anglica (Lydekker), a fossil albatross, in the Pliocene crags of East Anglia.;Coventry Univ, Dept Geog, Coventry CV1 5FB, W Midlands, England;;Wood, AM (corresponding author), Coventry Univ, Dept Geog, Priory St, Coventry CV1 5FB, W Midlands, England.;a.wood@coventry.ac.uk;;;;;175;6;6;0;8;PALAEONTOLOGICAL SOC JAPAN;TOKYO;MT BLDG 4F, 7-2-2, HONGO, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113-0033, JAPAN;1342-8144;;PALEONTOL RES;Paleontol.

Ordination of hauls along DIM1 of MDS was significantly correlated (spearman's r) with mesh size at codend, bridle length, and vertical opening of trawls. When CT and GOC73 were compared with MTS-25, the most dissimilar species were Aristeus antennatus, Galeus melastomus and Trachyrhynchus scabrus. a particular case was A. antennatus, with a significantly higher abundance in MTS-25 catches than the rest of the trawls. at 1200-1300 m the OTSB-14 and MTS-25 hauls were segregated in MDS analysis. DIM2 was correlated with the sampling period (month), indicating a temporal effect on haul composition. at 1200-1300 m the main dissimilarities between OTSB-14 and MTS-25 were marked by Alepocephalus rostratus and A. antennatus (caught with MTS-25), and by Cataetyx alleni, the notacanthidae Notacanthus bonapartei and Polyacanthonotus rissoanus, and Plesionika acanthonotus (caught with OTSB-14).

Selectivity data were collected by using a covered codend method and analysed taking between-haul variation into account. The results indicate significant increases in L-50 values in relation to an increase in mesh size and when the square mesh is used in the commercial trawl codend. The results demonstrate that the commercially used codend (40D) is not selective enough for P. longirostris in terms of length at first maturity. Changing from a 40D to a 48D codend significantly improves selection, with an increase of about 15% in the L-50 values (carapace length 14.5 mm for 40D and 16.6 mm for 48D). Similarly, 40 mm square mesh, which has recently been legislated for EU Mediterranean waters, showed a 12.4% higher mean L-50 value (16.3 mm) than 40 mm diamond mesh for this species. However, despite these improvements, the 48D and 40S codends still need further improvements to obtain higher selectivity closer to the length at first maturity (20 mm carapace length).;"[Kaykac, Hakan; Tokac, Adnan] Ege Univ, Fac Fisheries, TR-35100 Izmir, Turkey; [Ozbilgin, Huseyin] Mersin Univ, Fac Fisheries, TR-33169 Mersin, Turkey";;Kaykac, H (corresponding author), Ege Univ, Fac Fisheries, TR-35100 Izmir, Turkey.;hakan.kaykac@ege.edu.tr;"Tokac, Adnan/A-2409-2016; Ozbilgin, Huseyin/J-2521-2015";"Tokac, Adnan/0000-0002-2968-7315; Ozbilgin, Huseyin/0000-0002-7277-0608";;;33;16;16;0;15;CONSEJO SUPERIOR INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS-CSIC;MADRID;VITRUVIO 8, 28006 MADRID, SPAIN;0214-8358;1886-8134;SCI MAR;Sci.

Little is known however about the effects of bycatch in small-scale gillnet fisheries on bird populations. Here we review 30 studies reporting bird bycatch in coastal gillnet fisheries in the Baltic Sea and the North Sea region in order to assess the magnitude of this problem and potential effects on bird populations. All species of diving birds that occur in the study region, including divers (loons), grebes, sea ducks, diving ducks, auks and cormorants, have been reported as dying in fishing nets. The cumulative bycatch estimate extracted from several localized studies providing such information, suggests that about 90,000 birds die in fishing nets annually, a number that is almost certainly a substantial underestimate. We conclude that it is likely that between 100,000 and 200,000 waterbirds are killed per year. Geographic and temporal patterns of bycatch generally matched species distribution and periods of presence. Also, bycatch rates varied depending on species' foraging technique and were influenced by net parameters and fishing depth. To evaluate effects of additive mortality on bird populations, we applied the Potential Biological Removal (PBR) concept to three species with the most extensive bycatch information. Agreeing with PBR assumptions we conclude that bycatch is a matter of concern for at least two of the three assessed species. We suggest that bycatch research in Europe and beyond should aim at unification of principles for bycatch assessment, setting new standards for the monitoring of waterbird populations so that vital rates and mortality data are recorded, and implementing quantifiable criteria for evaluating effects of fisheries bycatch.

Early studies concluded that these ARs concentrated medium-and large-sized commercial fish, a fact that could lead to a risk of overfishing in the area. A decade after their deployment, the same ARs were re-examined using experimental fishing and visual censuses. Results from our study demonstrated that the Balearic ARs have not increased the risk of overfishing because fishing effort on them is moderate, trammel net efficiency on ARs is low, there are high immigration rates to the ARs, and there are natural areas with a medium-high seabed relief that hold reserve stocks that are larger than those found on the ARs. Likewise, we found that the overall condition of the ecosystem is more important for the characterization of the composition and yield of AR catches than are the eutrophic-oligotrophic conditions of the surrounding water masses. We note that the function of the aggregation/production ARs is only analogous to that of marine protected areas (MPAs) and that ARs therefore should always be managed to ensure the correct use of marine resources. Combining both intervention measures (ARs and WAS) in the environment may synergistically reinforce their respective effects.;"[Coll, Josep; Riera, Francesc] Direccio Gen Pesca, Govern Illes Balears, Palma De Mallorca 07006, Spain; [Abad, Raquel; Alvarez, Elvira; Deudero, Salud; Mas, Ramon; Moreno, Isabel] Univ Illes Balears, Lab Biol Marina, Palma De Mallorca 07071, Spain";;Coll, J (corresponding author), Direccio Gen Pesca, Govern Illes Balears, C Foners 10, Palma De Mallorca 07006, Spain.;jcoll@dgpesca.caib.es;Deudero, Salud/I-1883-2015;Deudero, Salud/0000-0001-5584-2801;"Spanish Ministry of Education and ScienceSpanish Government [MAR98-0258-C05-01]; Balearic Islands Government Directorate of Fisheries";The study to monitor the AR in the Bay of Palma was possible thanks to a grant from the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science (Plan Nacional I+D 1998-2000 Reference: MAR98-0258-C05-01).

As small organisms and benthic species with faster growth rates and shorter life histories can withstand the fishing mortality and benefit from reduced competition or predation, trawl fishing can enhance their proliferation. Thus, trawl fishing can lead to biomass loss and production increase, since smaller specimens are more productive than bigger ones. In the present Study we evaluate the effects, if any, of trawling on benthic crustacean macrofaunal production rates. Sampling was carried out in two neighbouring sites in the central Adriatic Sea (central Mediterranean), one affected by fishing activity and one not. Production and production/biomass (P/B) ratio of 13 species of peracarid and eucarid crustaceans were estimated using the Hynes size-frequency method. Estimates measured at both sites were compared in order to test the hypothesis that higher production and P/B values should Occur in the fished area rather than in the unfished one. Our results indicated that the effects on the species are more complex than expected in regard to this hypothesis, and that they depend on the ecological and behavioural characteristics of the selected species.;"[Ligas, A.; De Biasi, A.

Scaldfish were collected in May-June 2005 using a commercial otter trawler between 40 and 80 in on muddy bottoms. Our data show that scaldfish is a selective feeder and consumes similar prey items in the three gulfs, although between-site differences in the relative prey abundance in the stomachs were detected. In the three guns scaldfish fed mainly on the crab Goneplax rhomboides and on the fish Lesueurigobius suerii, but there was an increase in the consumption of L. suerii and the shrimp Alpheus glaber in the trawled areas. Ontogenetic changes were evident in the diet Of scaldfish, with juveniles preying mainly upon suprabenthic species, e.g. mysids and small decapods. While significant differences occurred in the diet of juveniles among all areas due to natural spatial variability, variations in the diet of adults, which feed on benthic prey, occurred between untrawled and trawled areas. These variations were clearly due to trawling disturbance, and no significant difference was detected in the diet of adults between the two trawled areas. On the contrary, the trophic level (delta N-15 values) of scaldfish did riot vary between trawled and untrawled areas and between juveniles and adults. Changes in the source of carbon, as detected by delta C-13 values, were evident between juveniles and adults, evidencing a shift from a suprabenthic (juveniles) to a benthic (adults) diet.;"[Fanelli, E.] CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, Pg Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Fanelli, E.; Badalamenti, F.; D'Anna, G.; Pipitone, C.] CNR, IAMC, I-91014 Castellammare Del Golfo, TP, Italy";;Fanelli, E (corresponding author), CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, Pg Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, Barcelona 08003, Spain.;efanelli@icm.csic.es;"Pipitone, Carlo/B-7562-2015; Fanelli, Emanuela/H-4412-2014; D'Anna, Giovanni/B-7995-2015; BADALAMENTI, FABIO/B-8508-2015";"Pipitone, Carlo/0000-0002-7632-1228; Fanelli, Emanuela/0000-0002-5358-5159; D'Anna, Giovanni/0000-0002-8644-8222; BADALAMENTI, FABIO/0000-0002-2395-454X";CNR-IAMC;The authors wish to thank all the participants in the field work and all the staff at CNR-IAMC in the Gulf of Castellammare.

While the direct impacts of trawl disturbances on benthic communities have been extensively studied, the consequences from long-term chronic disturbances are less well understood. The response of benthic macrofauna to chronic otter-trawl disturbance from a Nephrops norvegicus (Norway lobster) fishery was investigated along a gradient of fishing intensity over a muddy fishing ground in the northeastern Irish Sea. Chronic otter trawling had a significant, negative effect on benthic infauna abundance, biomass, and species richness. Benthic epifauna abundance and species richness also showed a significant, negative response, while no such effect was evident for epibenthic biomass. Furthermore, chronic trawl disturbance led to clear changes in community composition of benthic infauna and epifauna. The results presented indicate that otter-trawl impacts are cumulative and can lead to profound changes in benthic communities, which may have far-reaching implications for the integrity of marine food webs. Studies investigating the short-term effects of fishing manipulations previously concluded that otter trawling on muddy substrates had only modest effects on the benthic biota. Hence, the results presented by this study highlight that data from experimental studies can not be readily extrapolated to an ecosystem level and that subtle cumulative effects may only become apparent when fishing disturbances are examined over larger spatial and temporal scales. Furthermore, this study shows that data on chronic effects of bottom trawling on the benthos will be vital in informing the recently advocated move toward an ecosystem approach in fisheries management. As bottom-trawl fisheries are expanding into ever deeper muddy habitats, the results presented here are an important step toward understanding the global ecosystem effects of bottom trawling.;"[Hinz, Hilmar; Prieto, Virginia; Kaiser, Michel J.] Univ Wales, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Anglesey, Wales";;Hinz, H (corresponding author), Univ Wales, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Anglesey, Wales.;h.hinz@bangor.ac.uk;"Kaiser, Michel J/M-8543-2013; Hinz, Hilmar/AAH-7148-2019";"Hinz, Hilmar/0000-0003-4909-0089; Kaiser, Michel Josef/0000-0001-8782-3621";European UnionEuropean Commission [QLRT-2001-00787];This study was funded by the European Union as part of the project Response'' contract QLRT-2001-00787.

The focus has been mainly on increasing the mesh size in the cod-end or changing its mesh geometry; few studies have assessed the efficiency of the sorting grid systems. Analysis of 21 trawl hauls carried out at depths of 117-697 m off the Balearic Islands (western Mediterranean) in October-November 2005, studied size selectivity of the trawl using flexible sorting grids with 15 (SG15) and 20 (SG20) mm bar spacing. A divided polyamide bottom trawl designed for commercial purposes demonstrated high efficiency for the simultaneous use of both sorting grid sizes at different depth intervals (DS: deep shelf; US: upper slope; MS: middle slope). The results were also compared with those from the authors' previous studies in the area where 40 mm diamond (DM) and square (SM) mesh cod-ends were used. A saturation effect was detected on the DS for both sorting grids, due to the large amount of biomass captured at this depth interval. Size selectivity of 11 species was modelled, which showed an increase in length at first capture (L(50)) from SG15 to SG20. Values of L(50) estimated for the main target species were: 10.9 cm total length (TL) with SG15, and 18.9 cm TL with SG20 for Merluccius merluccius; 21.1 mm carapace length (CL) with SG15, and 23.8 mm CL with SG20 for Nephrops norvegicus; and 15.9 mm CL with SG15, and 19.6 mm CL with SG20 for Aristeus antennatus. Comparison of size selectivity parameters between the sorting grids and cod-ends of different geometry showed clear differences. For most species, the highest value of L(50) was obtained with SM (e.g. 26.6 mm CL for N. norvegicus and 22.1 mm CL for A. antennatus). Exceptions were the round-fish M. merluccius, the flatfish Lepidorhombus boscii, and the crustacean Parapenaeus longirostris, with values of SG20 (18.9 cm TL, 12.1 cm TL, and 25.7 mm CL, respectively) higher than with SM (15.2 cm TL, 10.2 cm TL, and 20.2 mm CL, respectively). Sorting grid selection ranges were broader than those estimated for DM and SM. Experience shows that the exchange of the DM for the SM and/or the introduction of SG20 can improve selectivity in the Mediterranean trawl, SM being more efficient than SG20 in the Balearic Islands.";"[Massuti, E.; Ordines, F.; Guijarro, B.] IEO Ctr Oceanog Balears, E-07015 Palma de Mallorca, Spain";;Massuti, E (corresponding author), IEO Ctr Oceanog Balears, Moll de Ponent S-N, E-07015 Palma de Mallorca, Spain.;enric.massuti@ba.ieo.es;"Ordinas, Francesc/AAG-7079-2021; Guijarro, Beatriz/I-2480-2015; Massuti, Enric/AAG-5117-2021";"Guijarro, Beatriz/0000-0002-2083-4681; Massuti, Enric/0000-0002-9524-5873; Ordines, F.

Survival rates depend on a variety of factors including the type and amount of disposed materials and the lifestyle of the organisms. Laboratory burial experiments using six common macrobenthic invertebrates from a brackish habitat of the western Baltic Sea were performed to test the organisms' escape reaction to dredged material disposal. Experimental lab-results were then extrapolated to a field situation with corresponding bottom topography and covering layer thicknesses at experimental field disposal study sites. Resulted survival rates were then verified by comparison with results of an earlier field study at the same disposal sites. Our experimental design in the lab included the disposal of two types of dredged material (i.e.'till' and 'sand/till mixture') and two covering layer depths (i.e.10-20 cm and 14-40 cm). All three bivalves Arctica islandica (Linnaeus), Macoma balthica (Linnaeus), Mya arenaria (Linnaeus) and the polychaete Nephtys hombergii (Savigny) successfully burrowed to the surface of a 32-41 cm deposited sediment layer of till or 'sand/till mixture and restored contact with the overlying water. These high escape potentials could partly be explained by the heterogeneous texture of the till and sand/till mixture with 'voids'. The polychaete Bylgides (Harmothoe) sarsi (Malmgren) successfully burrowed through a 16 cm covering layer whereas the polychaete Lagis koreni (Malmgren) showed almost no escaping reaction. No general differences in escape behaviour after burial were detected between our test species from the brackish habitat and those reported in the literature for the same species in marine environments. However, a size-dependence in mobility of motile polychaetes and M. arenaria was apparent within our study. In comparison to a thick coverage, thin coveting layers (i.e.15-16 cm and 20 cm) increased the chance of the organisms (N. hombergii and M. arenaria) to reach the sediment surface after burial. This was not observed for the other test species. While crawling upward to the new sediment surfaces burrowing velocities of up to 8 cm d(-1) were observed for the bivalves and up to 20 cm d(-1) for N. hombergii. Between 17 and 79% of the test organisms showed burrowing activity after experimental burial. The survival rate (defined as the ability to regained contact with the sediment surface) ranged from 0 to 33%, depending on species and on burial depth. The organisms reached the sediment surface by burrowing (polychaetes and bivalves) and/or by extending their siphons to the new sediment surface (bivalves). The extrapolation of laboratory survival rates to the two disposal sites was obtained based on the in situ thicknesses of the dredged spoil layers measured by multi-beam echo sounder. This resulted in total average survival rate estimates for the test species of 45 and 43% for the two disposal sites. The results obtained during the laboratory tests and the following extrapolation to the field were verified by the range of results from a previous field study, using grab sampling shortly before and after a disposal event in June 2001. The effect of dredged material disposal on the tested Baltic Sea benthic macrofauna was assessed by extrapolating the verified laboratory results to the field. (C ) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The Pomo pit (central Adriatic Sea) is a very important nursery area for European hake, Merluccius merluccius, but is also the main trawling ground for the Adriatic fleet exploiting Nephrops. The use of baited creels may constitute an alternative to bottom trawling. This paper summarises experimental data collected from the western Pomo pit in order to compare bottom trawl and baited creel catches with the aim of evaluating the ecological consequences of creeling. Because of high scavenger activity in the area, the effect of this on the creel fishery was also investigated. A large fraction of the trawl catch was composed of juvenile undersized individuals of commercial species, the same was not true for creels. Composition of Nephrops catches differed markedly between creels and the bottom trawl. Scavenger activity was very high. The results indicate that ecologically the use of baited creels appears to be a valid alternative to bottom trawling but, unfortunately, may not comprise an economically viable solution in the investigated area, which is 30 nautical miles offshore.

In this study, we observed the line-caught fish for 10d in a holding tank in order to investigate the independence and impact on mortality of several explanatory variables, including fish size, surface temperature, anatomical hooking location, bleeding, hook type, and line cutting. We observed a total PRM of 24.1% and the most important mortality factor by fir was the anatomical position of the hook. Anatomically deeper hooking events were highly correlated with fish size and the presence of blood during hooking injuries. The PRM obtained in this study was higher than values reported in previous Studies of this species, mainly because we considered the effects of passive angling techniques. Passive angling increased the incidence of deep hooking and consequently increased mortality compared to active angling. This technique also led to an increase in deep hooking by circle hooks. Therefore, we recommend that active angling techniques be encouraged and we emphasize the need for education on the correct use of circle hooks. This Study provides guidelines to managers, scientists, and anglers that will promote sustainable development of the recreational fisheries of the Mediterranean. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Experiments were conducted on the commercial fishing grounds of Kusadasi Bay and Sigacik Bay of the eastern Aegean Sea, between 3 and 27 October 2007. Twenty-four hauls were carried out, eleven with single and thirteen with double codends. The mean fifty-percent retention length (L(50)) values of double and single codends were found to be 12.0 +/- 0.09 and 16.9 +/- 0.08 mm, respectively. Selection range (SR) values for double and single codends were 4.0 +/- 0.05 and 5.9 +/- 0.09 mm, respectively. Significant differences were found between L50 and selection factor (SF) values of double and single codends (p < 0.05) for the deep-water rose shrimp. However, towing duration and catch size did not have any significant effect on these parameters (p > 0.05). This work shows that the use of 44 mm mesh size knotless polyethylene (PE) diamond mesh codends is by itself destructive for immature shrimp. The use of narrower netting around it to establish a double codend further decreases the already insufficient selectivity for this species.;"[Aydin, Celalettin; Tosunoglu, Zafer] Ege Univ, Fac Fisheries, TR-35100 Bornova, Turkey; [Ozbilgin, Huseyin] Mersin Univ, Fac Fisheries, TR-33169 Mersin, Turkey";;Aydin, C (corresponding author), Ege Univ, Fac Fisheries, TR-35100 Bornova, Turkey.;celalettin.aydin@ege.edu.tr;Ozbilgin, Huseyin/J-2521-2015;Ozbilgin, Huseyin/0000-0002-7277-0608;;;17;4;4;0;1;BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS;LEIDEN;PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS;0011-216X;;CRUSTACEANA;Crustaceana;;2009;82;2;;;;233;240;;10.1163/156854008X380264;;;8;Marine & Freshwater Biology;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Marine & Freshwater Biology;447TQ;WOS:000266215100007;;;;;10/01/2022

Data were collected during 23 trawl surveys carried out in spring-summer and autumn from June 1995 to November-December 2006. Specimens were collected between 13 and 745 m. No significant trends were shown in the fluctuation of the abundance indices throughout the study period, indicating a stable condition in the stock distributed from the shelf to the upper slope. A decreasing trend with depth was only shown in the density index values. The greatest biomass values were recorded in autumn and the highest incidence of juveniles (TL < 14 cm) was observed mainly during the spring. The sizes of the specimens in the catch were between 3.5 and 114cm TIL. However, the sampled population was mostly made up of specimens smaller than 24cm TL The females measured between 8 and 114 cm TL and the males between 10 and 93 cm TL The sex ratio fluctuated greatly during the investigated period and according to depth. The smallest mature female and male measured 30.5 and 17 cm TL, respectively. Mature individuals were collected both in spring and autumn. Their contribution to the sampled population was generally rather negligible, mostly in females. The estimated growth parameters were quite different between sexes with females (L(infinity) = 68.45 cm; k = 0.112 y(-1); t(0) = -1.18 y; phi'= 2.72) achieving older size-age than males (L(infinity) = 60.30 cm; k = 0.109 y(-1); t(0) = -1.56 y; phi'= 2.60). The age and growth performance examined in this study was confirmed by means of back calculation and, for the first years, by length-frequency analysis. The mortality rate (Z) calculated using the growth parameters derived from the direct age estimation varied between the annual value of 0.54 in 2001 and that of 0.87 in 2000 and 2003. The natural mortality rate (M) was computed using different approaches. In females it was between 0.24 and 0.23 while in males was between 0.25 and 0.24. Adopting two sets of growth parameters for sex combined and the M value of 0.22 and the value of 0.39, two scenarios for fishing mortality rates and exploitation ratios were obtained. Although, the total and fishing mortality rates and exploitation ratios fluctuated throughout the sampling period no significant trends were detected. The E values changed between 0.59 and 0.77 and no significant differences were observed with the two scenarios. A growth overfishing condition was detected for the stock in the North-western Ionian Sea. The exploited stock of L budegassa in the Ionian Sea mainly consists of juveniles younger than 3-4 years old. Although, spawners are extremely scarce, most probably as a consequence of fishing pressure, the continuity of recruitment seems to be guaranteed by adults distributed in refuge areas where trawl fishing does not occur.

De. ning Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) to address this will rely on ground fish surveys. Species-specific catch efficiencies vary between trawl gears, and apparent species diversity distributions are influenced by the type of gear used in each survey. It may be that no single survey depicts actual diversity distributions. Two MPA scenarios designed to protect ground fish species diversity are described, the first based on unadjusted International Bottom Trawl Survey data and the second based on the same data adjusted to take account of catchability. Spatial overlap between these scenarios is low. Assuming that the adjusted data best describe the actual species diversity distribution, the level of diversity safeguarded by MPAs, based on unadjusted data, is determined. A fishing effort redistribution model is used to estimate the increase in fishing activity that is likely to occur in MPAs that take catchability into account, if closed areas based solely on the unadjusted ground fish data were implemented. Our results highlight the need to take survey-gear catchability into account when designating MPAs to address fish-species diversity issues.;"[Fraser, Helen M.; Greenstreet, S. P.

Results showed low rates of immediate (10.8%) and delayed (3.3%) hooking mortality, a total mortality of 14.1%. Anatomical hook location and capture depth were the most significant predictors of mortality; 70.4% of fish caught with a deep location of hook died as a consequence of the damage caused, bleeding, and long unhooking times. Fish caught in depths > 16 m showed evidence of external barotrauma caused by rapid decompression, which increased the probability of death. The most common forms of barotrauma were swimbladder enlargement and stomach inversion. For fish vented with the aid of a hypodermic needle to extract excess gas, mortality was reduced by half. Factors such as surface temperature, fish size, and hook type (J hook vs. circle hook) could not explain the mortality of fish released into tanks.

Results showed that bottlenose dolphins avoided the upper shelf (shallower than 50 m) in the warm season, but not in the cold season and that the slope was avoided all year round. Bottlenose dolphins approached most of the trawlers surveyed in the continental shelf, but seldom interacted with those operating in the slope in the warm season. As a consequence, the average depth of trawling operations that attracted dolphins was shallower than those not attracting dolphins. No statistical difference was observed in the average catch of hauls conducted in the presence or in the absence of dolphins. However, discriminant analysis showed differences in catch composition between hauls with and without dolphin presence, but this difference was not attributed to the palatability of the catch, but to influence of trawling depth on the catch. It is concluded that depth is the main factor ruling occurrence of interaction. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The length frequency distribution of a population changes as the fish grow during the year which again affects the proportion of marketable fish in the fished population. Finally, fish condition and hence yield from individuals of a given length vary through the year. This paper quantifies these separate effects for two populations in the North Sea haddock trawl fishery: a general population for the whole North Sea and a localised fishery (within 20 nm of the east coast of the Orkney Islands) that has a high proportion of juveniles. These scenarios illustrate how the season in which fishing takes place, as well as the structure of the fished population, may influence the number of fish killed to produce a given gutted weight. Relationships describing the selectivity and weight (total and gutted) at length for three separate seasons are presented: pre-spawning in February, post-spawning in April and post-summer feeding in August/September. For the general North Sea population, the number of marketable fish required to provide 1 t of gutted fish increases by 34% in April compared to August. Likewise, the total number of fish killed (including discard and escape mortalities) to produce a tonne of gutted fish increases by 128% from August to April. Smaller differences in this effect are seen between February and August. Furthermore, the increased mortality in the Orkney population highlights the considerable waste of the resource that can occur when there are a high proportion of juveniles in the population. This study suggests that, by varying fishing strategy during the year, there is scope for optimizing the yield from a fishery, reducing waste and improving the long-term prospects for the stock.

This is the first large-scale Study on movements of tagged black anglerfish. A total of 877 black anglerfish (6-88 cm total length)and 1326 white anglerfish (15-137 cm total length) were tagged. Times at liberty ranged from I to 665 days,with recapture rates of 21 (2.4%)and 50(3.8%), respectively. A description of our tagging procedures is presented, together with the influences of the gear used, fish length and area of tagging on recapture rates. The type of fishing gear was the main factor affecting recapture rates. Fish length was neither related to the displacement distance nor to the time at liberty while the displacement distance was related to the time at liberty. Recapture locations suggested that movements Occurred both in- and offshore. The largest displacement recorded was 408 km of a black anglerfish from southern to northern Bay of Biscay. The movements of the anglerfish indicate a mixing between northern and southern populations which may have strong implications for the current geographical boundaries of the stocks from a management perspective. Here, movement of white anglerfish between the Le Danois Bank and the Cantabrian continental shelf is reported for the first time. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The investigation was carried out in the Cape Creus Marine Protected Area (MPA). Overall, 20 fish species and I invertebrate species were identified (three were coastal pelagic and the rest rocky benthic or demersal). in terms of abundance, two omnivorous species made up the 44% of the catch but in terms of weight. the main part (77%) of the catches relied on seven piscivorous (i.e. top-predator) fish (with trophic level values greater than 3.80). With the exception of three fish, the specie's intrinsic vulnerability values ranged between 40 and 90 (out of 100), implying a moderate to very high vulnerability to fishing. Spearfishing mainly targets large individuals measuring more than 30 cm in length. It is estimated that the total annual biomass extracted by spearfishing in the MPA is equivalent to ca.40% of the total biomass extracted annually by artisanal (commercial) fishing. Overall, results highlight the pressure spearfishing exerts on the reproductive potential of fish species in rocky habitats along the Mediterranean coast, particularly those that are vulnerable (i.e. long lived and slow growing species with low reproductive potential) and have a higher trophic level. Results support the assumption that spearfishing can induce changes in both the trophic structure and the intrinsic vulnerability of taxa in the catch. Considering the biological implications of spearfishing, management should be supported by additional regulations in order to protect species that are vulnerable and have a higher trophic level.

Spawning-stock biomass increased significantly after the ban. Moreover, females at depths >50 m in the post-ban period were larger than those collected before the ban at the same depth. The recruitment pattern of the population also changed. Notably, recruit numbers increased and recruitment occurs over a broader period. The increase in biomass after the trawl ban seems to be the result of a combination of different processes, mainly associated with the lowering of fishing mortality.

We investigated the effect of mesh configuration on the size selectivity of nine species (the scaldfish Arnoglossus laterna, the broad-tail shortfin squid Illex coindettii, the European hake Merluccius merluccius, the red mullet Mullus barbatus, the Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus, the common pandora Pagellus erythrinus, the deepwater rose shrimp Parapenaeus longirostris, the Mediterranean horse mackerel Trachurus mediterraneus and the poor-cod Trisopterus minutus capelanus) commonly captured in the Mediterranean demersal trawls. Two codends having meshes with the same opening (ca. 38 mm) but different mesh configuration (DM38: diamond-mesh and SM38: square-mesh configuration) were fished daily and alternately on the same trawl. They demonstrated a Substantial improvement in selectivity with square-mesh. Selectivity was Measured using the covered codend technique, the cover being supported by circular hoops. The results were analysed taking into account the between-haul variation in selectivity. Two other important external variables Were identified: the trawling depth and the codend catch, which for some species influenced between-haul variation, but there was no evidence of a coherent effect on selectivity parameters. The selectivity of 40 mm diamond-mesh codend has been reported to be rather poor because a large proportion of the codend catch is immature and smaller than the Minimum landing size (MLS) or first maturity size. With the exception of the flatfish (A. laterna), the effect of a change of mesh configuration from diamond- to square-mesh on size selectivity positively affected the retention length at 50% (L-50). However, square-meshes were found to be unsuitable for flat and/or deep-bodied fish as these escape more readily from diamond-meshes. The Council Regulation (EC) No. 1967/2006, concerning management measures for the Sustainable exploitation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean, establishes the MLS of marine organisms. However, the increase in L-50 with square-mesh would not avoid some ofthe existing contradictions in allowing the use of codend mesh which leads to lower L-50 than the MLS. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

To offset this externality, the mandatory use of veil nets or separator panels was introduced in 2003 for all vessels using an aggregate beam length of more than 8 m. Sea trials prior to this date suggested that retained catch might be reduced by between 8% and 35%, depending on the area and season. These studies, however, do not consider the behavioural response by fishers to reduce this impact. In this study, the actual impact of the restrictions on the productivity of UK Crangon vessels was estimated using a production frontier approach. The ex post analysis suggests that a productivity decline of around 14% has been experienced by UK vessels adopting this gear.;"[Innes, James] Univ Portsmouth, CEMARE, Portsmouth PO1 3AE, Hants, England; [Pascoe, Sean] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Cleveland, Qld 4163, Australia";;Innes, J (corresponding author), Univ Portsmouth, CEMARE, 1-8 Burnaby Rd, Portsmouth PO1 3AE, Hants, England.;"james.innes@port.ac.uk; sean.pascoe@csiro.au";"Pascoe, Sean/D-9710-2011; Innes, James/D-9424-2011";"Pascoe, Sean/0000-0001-6581-2649; Innes, James/0000-0003-1975-6062";;;28;6;6;0;12;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-857X;1477-9552;J AGR ECON;J.

The catch was sorted as target species and bycatch and the selectivity with respect to European hake was investigated using the covered codend method. The square-mesh codend allowed a reduction of about 37% of the fraction discarded at sea. The mean catch obtained with the experimental codend was lower than that obtained with the traditional codend (about 14 kg per haul) but the short-term economic losses were low (similar to 12%). The square-mesh codend was also more selective than the traditional codend, giving the juveniles of European hake a good chance of escape: the mean selection length (L-50) was 7.60 cm in DM and 12.98 cm in SM. Moreover, the mesh configuration did not affect the gear's performance.

In the laboratory, mechanical stress was Simulated by shaking clams in a vortex mixer. In the field, clams were collected seasonally at two sites along the northern Adriatic coast (Lido and Jesolo) and four levels of stress were applied: the highest was that used in commercial fishing (i.e. high water pressure and mechanised sorting) and the lowest manual sampling by SCUBA divers. Survival in air was the most sensitive biomarker in evaluating mechanical stress in the laboratory. Clearance rate also decreased significantly when shaking was applied. Field results indicated that high water pressure and mechanised sorting affected clearance, scope for growth and survival in air, all showing decreasing trends as mechanical stress increased at both sampling sites. The detrimental effects of mechanical disturbance may be emphasised depending on season, when exogerous and endogenous stress increases.

The Cape Roux marine protected area (MPA), in the Mediterranean Sea, was established in December 2003 for the management of artisanal fisheries and enhancement target fish stocks. Monitoring of littoral fish assemblages (0-30 m depth) in this zone began one year after the MPA was set up. The survey was conducted at 6 stations, located inside and outside the MPA, using three methods: underwater visual census (UVC) on transects, UVC using a new fish assemblage survey technique (FAST), and experimental net fishing performed by a fisherman. The FAST indices were derived from visual censuses, performed along a random pathway, scoring species on a presence/absence basis and size on a 2-class basis. Indices were calculated seasonally, by applying weights according to species and size. This study presents results obtained between October 2005 and June 2007. In the protected area, the experimental fishing yielded significantly higher abundance and species richness, and the FAST method highlighted a decrease in seasonal fluctuations. These two complementary methods (UVC and experimental fishing) revealed the early changes in fish assemblages in response to protection. The FAST method employed here seems to be relevant for the study of artisanal fishery target fishes, as a low-cost and sensitive UVC method.;"[Seytre, Catherine; Francour, Patrice] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, EA ECOMERS 4228, F-06108 Nice 2, France";;Francour, P (corresponding author), Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, EA ECOMERS 4228, Parc Valrose, F-06108 Nice 2, France.;patrice.francour@unice.fr;;Francour, Patrice/0000-0002-8489-1319;;;30;20;22;0;18;EDP SCIENCES S A;LES ULIS CEDEX A;17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE;0990-7440;1765-2952;AQUAT LIVING RESOUR;Aquat.

The plaice box, a gear restriction area in the North Sea that was established to reduce the bycatch of undersized plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), is considered ineffective because there has been a shift in the distribution of juvenile plaice to the waters that remained open to bottom trawlers. Here we examine the hypothesis that bottom trawling benefits the small benthic invertebrates that form the food source for plaice and that the plaice box had a negative impact on food production for plaice. A size-based model of benthic communities indicates that the production of prey was low without trawling and maximal in areas that are trawled once to twice a year. Therefore, bottom disturbance may improve the feeding conditions for species that feed on small invertebrates. As plaice aggregate at the locations with the highest benthic biomass, this may explain the observed redistribution to areas outside the plaice box. We conclude that the plaice box may not have been the most appropriate measure to protect plaice from discarding and that the species' ecology should be considered when choosing the most appropriate management measure to achieve an objective.;"[Hiddink, Jan Geert] Univ Wales Bangor, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Anglesey, Wales; [Rijnsdorp, Adriaan D.; Piet, Gerjan] Inst Marine Resources & Ecosyst Studies, Wageningen IMARES, NL-1970 AB Ijmuiden, Netherlands";;Hiddink, JG (corresponding author), Univ Wales Bangor, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Anglesey, Wales.;J.Hiddink@bangor.ac.uk;"Rijnsdorp, Adriaan/A-4217-2008; Hiddink, Jan Geert/C-1238-2009";"Rijnsdorp, Adriaan/0000-0003-0785-9662; Hiddink, Jan Geert/0000-0001-7114-830X";;;36;46;46;0;40;CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS;OTTAWA;1200 MONTREAL ROAD, BUILDING M-55, OTTAWA, ON K1A 0R6, CANADA;0706-652X;;CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI;Can.

Attempts to use bottom-set pots as an alternative to gillnets and longlines have been unsuccessful, as pots too are affected by large bycatches of crab. In this field study, pots were floated off the bottom in order to avoid crab bycatch. A standard two-chamber groundfish pot was modified by mounting a suspension arrangement that allowed the pot to orient itself with the current about 70 cm above the seabed. Fishing trials were conducted in the Varangerfjord (northern Norway) to compare floated and bottom-set reference pots. Floating the pots off the bottom eliminated king crab catches, while bottom-set pots caught an average of 21 crabs each. Moreover, floated pots caught significantly more cod than bottom-set pots (3.6 and 2.5 cod per pot, respectively), with the majority of the 45% increase being cod below minimum legal size. The catch increase was explained by the fact that the entrance of floated pots always maintained a down-current orientation, whereas in bottom-set pots shifting current directions may lead the odour plume away from the entrance. thereby reducing the rate of entry of cod. Full-scale fishing trials are needed in order to evaluate whether floated pots could become a commercially viable method of catching cod. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The fishery management essentially relies on conservation measures, a total at I owed catch (TAC) for Nephrops together with a mini mum landing size (MLS) and minimum trawl mesh size (70 mm stretched mesh). These measures have failed to prevent high discard levels of many species that characterize the fishery. Nephrops trawlers thus discard about half of their Nephrops catches in numbers (a third in weight) of which only 30% survive. Nephrops discards mainly occur in younger Nephrops age groups below the MLS. This is a waste for the already overexploited Nephrops stock as well as for the fleet. Based on a bio-economic simulation model, the paper analyses the consequences of several scenarios of improving Nephrops selectivity. The potential impacts of these scenarios on Nephrops biomass, landings, discards and economic indicators (e.g. rent) are examined and a cost-benefit analysis of each scenario is carried out. We show that a better exploitation pattern would benefit fisheries that have high level of discards. Reducing non-commercial Nephrops discards leads to positive net present values of rent with better value realized from the production potential and limited short-term losses for the fishing units. By taking account of the economic dynamics of increasing effort however, we show that selectivity measures are insufficient. Regulating access to the fishery is also required to ensure the sustainability of the fishery and a better exploitation of the production potential. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The main problems of fisheries management are the capture and killing of juvenile and undersized fish and thus restrictions mainly concern mesh size in cod-end. However another recurrent problem and non-negligible is the by-catch of undersize commercial fish and of non-target species. Hence, regulations to reduce such by-catch have formed a part of fisheries management techniques since the early 20th century. As a consequence, successful developments and technical modification have been used to reduce capture of undersized fish and discards (i.e. mesh size, separator panels, and sorting grids) in the last decades. Technical modification concerning reduction of damage and mortality to benthic communities are less documented. Most of the tentative to replace tickler chain, panels or legs by other systems have failed, while results showed a decrease in non-target catch, and a decrease in commercial catch was observed. This paper presents fishing experiments with modified otter trawl aimed at reducing discard rates and direct mortality of benthic infauna and epifauna without affecting the level of landings (i.e. a comparison of environmental effects caused by a conventional otter trawl compared to a modified otter trawl with enlighten experimental legs). Catch composition, by-catch and short-term effects to macro- and megafauna communities of both fishing gear (conventional and modified) were investigated. Results show that no differences for commercial catch biomass or for benthic communities' structure were observed. Moreover, by-catch analysis showed no difference while significant higher damage and direct mortality were observed for target and non-target species caught by the normal otter trawl compared to those caught by the modified one. Consequently, although limited, the severity of the damage appears to be linked with the type of trawl-legs used. The modified otter trawl permits to decrease damage and mortality to captured and non-captured organism and thus to reduce impacts to exploited marine ecosystems. These results are of interest and appear attractive in the framework of marine ecosystems preservation and conservation, as well as of fisheries management. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The results are based on abundance index (number/haul) and catch length composition obtained from a series of bottom trawl surveys carried out in the area (1993-2005). Abundance trends are similar considering or not closed areas, but with much lower values excluding closed areas. The length distributions revealed that in some of the species like Scyliorhinus canicula the larger specimens were the most affected by this decrease in number. Finally, the effects and consequences of one of these marine protected areas (MPAs), an artificial reef were examined in more detail for all the fishes and invertebrates. The analysis of the yield series showed an increase in total biomass after the placement of the reefs not only for S. canicula and rays but also teleosts fishes like Pagellus acarne, Trachurus trachurus, Mullus surmuletus and Trachinus draco and particularly invertebrates (sea urchins). On the contrary, the main target species of the trawl fishery (hake, monkfish and megrim among others) did not increase. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

It considers how the catchability of different fish species in two different types of bottom trawls, the IBTS GOV and the 8-m beam trawl, influences the estimates of species diversity. Maps of groundfish species diversity derived from these two survey trawls are compared to determine the extent to which the maps of spatial variation in groundfish species diversity are influenced by gear type. Catchability-at-length coefficients were applied to the IBTS data to raise the observed catches to estimates of actual numbers of fish present in the path of the trawl, which are then used to produce maps of actual species diversity across the North Sea. Finally, these raised maps of actual groundfish species diversity are shown to be more explainable based on physical environmental parameters such as depth. We suggest that species diversity maps that take account of catchability provide more reliable information on which to base management decisions than gear-biased views. The implications for management are discussed, with particular emphasis on using closed areas to conserve marine biodiversity.;"[Fraser, Helen M.; Greenstreet, Simon P.

Trends were also examined for the artificial fractions derived from the discarding process (the marketed, the discarded, and the non-marketed clusters of the catch), as well as for the big and small fractions (defined by the size at which 50% of all specimens were discarded). The ratio of the discarded/ marketed catch fluctuated greatly. Two commercial (Merluccius merluccius, and Mullus barbatus) and two non-marketed species (Lepidotrigla cavillone, and Argentina sphyroena) were the characteristic species of the fractions. A declining trend with time was observed for the examined time-series for species richness (S), Margalef's d, and average taxonomic distinctness (Delta+), whereas the variation in taxonomic distinctness (Lambda+) increased. The composition and/or trophic level of discards in relation to the marketed catch seemed to be indicative of the exploitation state of the demersal community: differences between the discarded and marketed fractions were high at the beginning of the fishing season (autumn), but the values of the indices converged at the end of the fishing season (spring). These changes could be attributed to alternative discarding strategies for certain species in response to increased cumulative fishing mortality towards the end of the period.;"[Tsagarakis, K.; Machias, A.; Giannoulaki, M.; Somarakis, S.] Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Iraklion 71003, Crete, Greece; [Tsagarakis, K.; Karakassis, I.] Univ Crete, Dept Biol, Iraklion 71003, Crete, Greece";;Machias, A (corresponding author), Hellen Ctr Marine Res, POB 2214, Iraklion 71003, Crete, Greece.;amachias@her.hcmr.gr;"Giannoulaki, Marianna/B-6359-2012; Tsagarakis, Konstantinos/A-1283-2012; Karakassis, Ioannis/D-9541-2011; Karakassis, Ioannis/M-2043-2019";"Tsagarakis, Konstantinos/0000-0003-2408-0220; Karakassis, Ioannis/0000-0001-8799-4375; Karakassis, Ioannis/0000-0001-8799-4375";;;46;32;33;0;13;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;1054-3139;1095-9289;ICES J MAR SCI;ICES J.

The most commonly discarded non-commercial species was boarfish, accounting for 5% of total discards. Slippage accounts for 10% of all discards, and the most common species slipped is herring.

However, nematodes may still be indirectly affected by the physical disturbance of trawling through changing sediment characteristics and food web structure. We determined whether nematode communities on two muddy fishing grounds located in the North Sea and Irish Sea were affected by chronic otter-trawl disturbance and quantified these effects. Nematode abundance, production, and genus richness declined in response to trawling within both areas. Nematode biomass did not respond to trawling intensity. Genus composition was affected by trawling only in the North Sea. The responses in abundance of individual nematode genera to increasing trawling intensity were negative as well as positive. These results indicate that despite their size and fast life cycle, nematodes are affected by intensive trawling on muddy fishing grounds. The loss in secondary production from nematodes can have far-reaching consequences for the integrity of the benthic food web. As bottom trawl fisheries are expanding into ever deeper muddy habitats, the results presented here are an important step towards understanding the global ecosystem effects of bottom trawling.;"[Hinz, Hilmar; Hiddink, Jan G.; Forde, James; Kaiser, Michel J.] Univ Wales, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Gwynedd, Wales";;Hinz, H (corresponding author), Univ Wales, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Gwynedd, Wales.;h.hinz@bangor.ac.uk;"Hiddink, Jan Geert/C-1238-2009; Kaiser, Michel J/M-8543-2013; Hinz, Hilmar/AAH-7148-2019";"Hiddink, Jan Geert/0000-0001-7114-830X; Hinz, Hilmar/0000-0003-4909-0089; Kaiser, Michel Josef/0000-0001-8782-3621";;;40;15;15;0;16;NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA-N R C RESEARCH PRESS;OTTAWA;BUILDING M 55, OTTAWA, ON K1A 0R6, CANADA;0706-652X;;CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI;Can.

Two typical behavioral responses of roundfish are described as the herding response and the escaping response, which were analyzed from video recordings by time sequences of the movement parameters. It was found that most of the actively escaping fish approached the square mesh window at right angles by swimming straight ahead with very little change in direction, while most of the herded fish approached the net at obtuse angles and retreated by sharp turning. The herding and escaping responses showed significant difference when characterized by frequency distributions of swimming speed and angular velocity, and both responses showed large and irregular variations in swimming movement parameters like the panic erratic responses. It is concluded that an escaping or herding response to the square mesh window could be decided by an interaction between the predictable parameters that describe the stimuli of net and angular changes of fish response, such as approaching angle, turning angle and angular velocity.;"[Kim, Yong-Hae; An, Young-Su] Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Inst Marine Ind, Coll Marine Sci, Kyeognam 650160, South Korea; [Wardle, Clem S.] FRS Marine Lab, Aberdeen AB11 9DB, Scotland";;An, YS (corresponding author), Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Inst Marine Ind, Coll Marine Sci, Kyeognam 650160, South Korea.;yosuan@gnu.ac.kr;;;;;28;10;13;0;9;SPRINGER JAPAN KK;TOKYO;SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN;0919-9268;1444-2906;FISHERIES SCI;Fish.

A calibrated food web model representing current conditions of the ecosystem and selectivity data from recent fishing experiments were used to perform temporal dynamic simulations. This enabled the evaluation of direct and indirect impacts of fishing and provided insights into the sustainability of various management options for the trawl fishery. This fishery has the biggest fleet in the area, it is highly multispecies, and catches are largely composed of juveniles of target species and non-target species, which are often discarded in large quantities. Simulations indicate that improvement of trawl selectivity would have noticeable and complex direct and indirect effects on target and non-target demersal species. The biomass and catch of various commercial species (e.g. anglerfish, adult hake) would increase, while that of invertebrates (e.g. suprabenthos, Norway lobster) and juvenile and small-sized fish species (e.g. juvenile hake, blue whiting) would decrease due to higher predation mortalities and trophic cascades in the food web. Impacts on the pelagic compartment would also be noticeable. A slight increase in the mean trophic level of the community and of the catch is predicted, as well as of ecosystem biomass diversity. Generally, however, a greater reduction of fishing effort would be necessary for the recovery of highly exploited or overexploited demersal species. Trawling would experience moderate decreases in catches, while long-lining and bait-trolling would benefit. This work highlights the importance of including the mortality incurred during or post-escape from trawl nets when assessing the ecosystem effects of improved trawl selectivity.;"[Coll, Marta; Bahamon, Nixon; Sarda, Francesc; Palomera, Isabel] CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, Passeig Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Tudela, Sergi] WWF Mediterranean Programme Off, Barcelona 08002, Spain; [Suuronen, Petri] Finnish Game & Fisheries Res Inst, Helsinki 00791, Finland";;Coll, M (corresponding author), CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, Passeig Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, Barcelona 08003, Spain.;mcoll@icm.csic.es;"Bahamon, Nixon/O-2476-2019; Coll, Marta/A-9488-2012; Palomera, Isabel/L-4769-2014; Sarda, Francisco/L-6229-2014; Bahamon, Nixon/K-8922-2014";"Bahamon, Nixon/0000-0002-5802-7367; Coll, Marta/0000-0001-6235-5868; Palomera, Isabel/0000-0001-5708-168X; Sarda, Francisco/0000-0001-7905-4148; Bahamon, Nixon/0000-0002-5802-7367";;;60;30;31;0;20;INTER-RESEARCH;OLDENDORF LUHE;NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY;0171-8630;1616-1599;MAR ECOL PROG SER;Mar.

The selectivity of a flexible sorting grid with 20-mm bar spacing (BS20) installed in front the conventional trawl cod end was investigated. The standard covered cod end method was used. Data was adequate for analyzing the selectivity of European hake Merluccius merluccius, poor cod Trisopterus minutus, greater forkbeard Phycis blennoides and Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus. The selectivity of the 20-mm sorting grid was compared with the performance of 40-mm diamond (DM40) and square mesh (SM40) cod ends. The effect of a guiding funnel on the performance of the grid (BS20-f) was also explored. Finally, the potential changes in yield per recruit (Y/R) and biomass per recruit (B/R) after implementing a sorting grid were explored. An overall improvement in the 50% selection length (L-50 ) with all four species was substantial when comparing the BS20 to the DM40. Higher improvement in L(50)s was achieved when the grid was equipped with the guiding funnel. When comparing the performance of the BS20-f to the SM40, there was no marked difference in L50S. The Y/R and B/R, however, are substantially higher with BS20-f for poor cod and about the same for European hake. BS20 compared to SM40 achieved lower Y/R and B/R for all four species; the smallest difference was observed for Norway lobster.

Recent requirements to develop and implement an ecosystem approach to management are placing increasing and varied demands on such datasets. Successfully incorporating ecosystem and environmental objectives within fisheries management will, for example, require greater understanding of foodweb trophodynamics, which in turn requires detailed information on the abundance and distribution of fish predators and prey species on spatial scales hitherto rarely considered. However, no trawl gear catches all the fish in its path, so density estimates provided by such trawl samples do not reflect true densities of fish. Catchability in a trawl gear is affected by many factors and varies both between species and between different sized conspecifics, and therefore has the capacity to confound our understanding of predator -prey interactions and of the relative abundance of different species and size classes of fish at any point in time or space. To overcome such problems, estimates of the catchability of each size class of each species sampled in a given survey are required for trawl sample densities to be raised to the actual densities of fish present at each location sampled. Here, we present a method for estimating catchability coefficients for 1-cm size classes of fish species sampled by the Grande Overture Vertical trawl during the third quarter ICES International Bottom Trawl Survey. The catchability coefficients obtained are applied to survey data collected between 1998 and 2004 to examine annual variation in actual abundance of the demersal fish assemblage in the North Sea.;"[Fraser, Helen M.; Greenstreet, Simon P.

The mortality of cod and saithe was negligible and unrelated to experimental conditions. Haddock mortality was generally greater than observed in earlier experiments and inversely related to fish length. Any possible effects of experimental conditions were hidden by large variability in the observed rates of mortality. We conclude that the observed mortality of haddock is confounded by methodological problems, particularly the instability of the observation cages, and does not reflect the true escape mortality.

The fishing effort and turtle catch of vessels harbouring at Lampedusa island and fishing in the wider central Mediterranean area was monitored using a voluntary logbook programme. Two large trawlers were monitored between 2003 and 2005 and six small vessels using trawl nets, pelagic longline or bottom longline were monitored in the summer 2005. 2. The observed turtle catch rates of pelagic longline and bottom trawl were among the highest recorded in the basin, and high catch rates by bottom longline were observed too. This suggests that the area contains major oceanic and neritic habitats for the loggerhead turtle Caretta caretta in the Mediterranean Sea. 3. When fishing effort is considered, these results suggest a very high number of captures by Italian trawlers and longliners in the area, as well as by fleets from other countries. This is reason of concern for the conservation of the loggerhead turtle within the Mediterranean Sea. 4. Different fishing gear have different technical/operational characteristics affecting turtle catch and mortality and the present knowledge about associated parameters of these gear varies too. 5. All this considered, specific actions are recommended: (i) an awareness campaign to fishermen to reduce post-release mortality, (ii) technical modifications to pelagic longline gear to reduce turtle catch, (iii) further investigation into turtle bycatch in all fishing gear, with priority given to bottom longline fishing and quantification of mortality caused by trawlers, (iv) assessment of the turtle populations affected by fishing activity in the area, and (v) international cooperation in undertaking threat assessments, and implementing regulations, management measures and monitoring.

These species mature at different sizes and hence have a range of minimum landing sizes. Their different shapes and swimming capabilities imply different selection characteristics when escaping from trawl gear. However, they are often caught at the same time on the same grounds. Optimal exploitation can only be achieved by ensuring that the selection of each species varies appropriately with length during the fishing process. This paper describes one part of a large European project to develop species-selective trawl gear to improve the exploitation pattern of North Sea cod, while maintaining the catch of other important commercial species. A gear suitable to the Scottish mixed whitefish fishery was fitted with a horizontal panel in the tapered part of the net to separate species into an upper and lower compartment. Trials were conducted on research vessels to measure separation performance for nine species in different light conditions, at different towing speeds, and with different lengths of panel. Most haddock, whiting, and saithe pass above the panel, whereas most cod, flatfish, and monkfish pass below it. Towing speed and panel length had no significant effect on separation. At lower light levels during the night (April at latitude 58 degrees to 61 degrees N), fewer dab, sole, plaice, and cod pass below the panel. Observations and measurements of fish behaviour using acoustic methods are described. They suggest that the height at which fish enter the net mouth may be influenced by light level and water clarity.;"[Ferro, R. S. T.; Jones, E. G.; Kynoch, R. J.; Fryer, R.

Fishing location choice is considered to be a dynamic process whereby trawlers chose from among a repertoire of plastic strategies that they modify if their gains fall below a fixed proportion of the mean gains of the fleet as a whole. The distribution of fishing across different areas of a fishery follows an approximate ideal free distribution (IFD) with varying noise due to uncertainty. The least-productive areas are not utilised because initial net input never reaches the mean yield of better areas subject to competitive exploitation. In cases, where there is a weak temporal autocorrelation between fish stocks in a specific location, a plastic strategy of local translocation between trawls mixed with longer-range translocation increases realised input. The trawler can change its translocation strategy in the light of information about recent trawling success compared to its long-term average but, in contrast to predictions of the Marginal Value Theorem (MVT) model, does not know for certain what it will find by moving, so may need to sample new patches. The combination of the two types of translocation mirrored beam-trawling strategies used by the Dutch fleet and the resultant distribution of trawling effort is confirmed by analysis of historical effort distribution of British otter trawling fleets in the North Sea. Fisheries exploitation represents an area where dynamic agent-based adaptive models may be a better representation of the economic dynamics of a fleet than classically inspired optimisation models.

Relationships between total length and fork length, height, width and girth were estimated and the selectivity parameters of a 44 mm PE diamond mesh codend determined for common pandora (Pagellus erythrinus) and axillary sea bream (Pagellus acarne). Two data sets were collected during demersal trawl trials carried out in Izmir Bay (Aegean Sea) between May 1996 and February 1997. Regression analyses were used to determine the relationships between total length and other measured dimensions of the species. However, selectivity parameters were estimated from pooled data by using the logistic equation with the maximum likelihood method. Fork length, height, width and girth were found to increase linearly with total length for both species (R-2 > 0.90, except TL-W for axillary sea bream, 0.76). Ratios of average body thickness (W/H) were 0.45 (+/- 0.002) for common pandora and 0.52 (+/- 0.002) for axillary sea bream. L-50 and SR values were found as 12.4 (+/- 0.44) and 2.2 (+/- 0.51) from the eight valid hauls for common pandora and as 13.6 (+/- 0.13) and 1.9 (+/- 0.26) from the three valid hauls for axillary sea bream, respectively.

The mean mesh size of the cod end meshes (nominal 46 mm) was measured near to 50 mm by using a calliper rule. Selectivity data were collected by the covered cod end method and analysed by means of a logistic equation with the Maximum Likelihood method. The mean selectivity curves were estimated from the individual hauls that were fitted taking into account the variation between hauls.

Discarding represents a potentially significant loss to the productivity of fish stocks; it can have damaging ecological consequences, and is a potential cause of the failure of recovery plans. The Nephrops fishery in the North Sea is classified as a mixed fishery. Nephrops trawls are constructed with smaller meshes than trawls used to target whitefish; consequently, the bycatch of juvenile fish can be substantial. Several new Nephrops trawl designs have been tested in the North Sea. The data from these trials are used to investigate the potential impact of their implementation on cod, haddock and whiting stocks in the North Sea (including the Kattegat and Skagerrak). The model examines five trawl designs, and also the scenarios of a cessation of discarding in all North Sea fisheries and in just the Nephrops fishery. The model is deterministic, and evaluates the relative differences between scenarios assuming all other variables remain constant. If discarding of cod, haddock and whiting in the North Sea fisheries were eliminated, stocks would increase by 41%, 14% and 29%, respectively, within 10 years. Eliminating discarding in the Nephrops fishery alone would increase stocks by 2%, 1% and 13%, respectively, reflecting the relative proportion of catches of these species in the Nephrops fishery. For cod and haddock, the introduction of the Nephrops trawl with a grid with a square-mesh codend was the only scenario in which a notable increase in stock number was observed. This trawl design facilitates the escape of fish of all ages/sizes from the trawl, effectively making the Nephrops fishery a single-species fishery. For whiting, stock numbers and landings increased under all scenarios, but forecasted landings were lower than if current discard patterns continued in all except the no-discards scenario. The dependency of the results on the validity of the assumptions and on the accuracy of the input data is discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

To reduce the unwanted bycatch in gillnets, pingers (acoustic alarms) have been developed that are attached to the nets. In the European Union, pingers will be made compulsory in some areas in 2005 and in others in 2007. However, pingers may effect non-target marine fauna such as fish. Therefore in this study, the effects of seven commercially-available pingers on the behaviour of five North Sea fish species in a large tank were quantified. The species tested were: sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), pout (Trisopterus luscus), thick-lip mullet (Chelon labrosus), herring (Clupea harengus), and cod (Gadus morhua). The fish were housed as single-species schools of 9-13 individuals in a tank. The behaviour of fish in quiet periods was compared with their behaviour during periods with active pingers. The results varied both between pingers and between fish species. Sea bass decreased their speed in response to one pinger and swam closer to the surface in response to another. Thicklip mullet swam closer to the bottom in response to two pingers and increased their swimming speed in response to one pinger. Herring swam faster in response to one pinger, and pout and cod (close relatives) showed no behavioural responses to any of the pingers. Of the seven pingers tested, four elicited responses in at least one fish species, and three elicited no responses. Whether similar responses would be elicited in these fish species in the wild, and if so, whether such responses would influence the catch rate of fisheries, cannot be derived from the results of this study. However, the results indicate the need for field studies with pingers and fish. Based on the small number of fish species tested, the present study suggests that the higher the frequency of a pinger, the less likely it is to affect the behaviour of marine fish.

During this autumn period, the Norwegian purse-seine fleet catches mackerel in the southern part of the Norwegian Sea and the northern part of the North Sea. Between 1999 and 2005, Norway's Institute for Marine Research carried out annual acoustic surveys on a research vessel capable of trawling, to estimate the biomass concurrently with the fishery. During the surveys, mackerel were sampled with pelagic trawls (486 and 538 m circumference) at an average speed of 3.5-4 knots, and age, length, and weight was determined for use in biomass estimation. Mackerel age, length, weight, length-at-age, and weight-at-length (condition) in trawl catches were all significantly lower than observed in purse-seine catches from nearby commercial vessels, indicating that the research trawl selects younger, smaller, and perhaps weaker, fish. This finding has a significant influence on acoustic estimation of abundance of mackerel. Using data from purse-seine-caught mackerel instead of those caught in the trawl, the estimated total number of mackerel in the area of operation decreased by an average of 26.4%, and concurrent estimates of total biomass increased by an average of 32.2%. The results raise the importance of awareness of the differences in applying trawl samples to estimate year-class abundance and biomass and to study variations in growth and condition of fast-swimming species such as mackerel.;Inst Marine Res, N-5817 Bergen, Norway;;Slotte, A (corresponding author), Inst Marine Res, PO Box 1870, N-5817 Bergen, Norway.;aril.slotte@imr.no;;;;;20;13;13;1;16;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;1054-3139;;ICES J MAR SCI;ICES J.

Satellite-based vessel monitoring systems (VMS) were designed for fishery control and enforcement, but they provide potentially valuable source information on spatial and temporal patterns of trawling activity at multiple scales. Based on an analysis of VMS data for UK beam trawlers in the North Sea, a method is described for identifying trawling activity and estimating fishing intensity based on the minimum and maximum potential spatial extent of trawling effort from VMS data. The optimal method for identifying trawling and steaming behaviour combined speed and directionality rules and correctly identified trawling and steaming in 99% and 95% of cases, respectively. Using speed- and directionality-filtered VMS data, trawling effort can be reported as area impacted per unit time per unit area at a range of grid scales from 1 km to 100 km (10 000 km(2)).

Two codends having meshes with the same opening (ca. 44 mm) but different twine thicknesses (Light PA: R3644tex, O 2.38 mm and Heavy PA: R5312tex, O 2.89 mm) were fished daily and alternately on the same trawl. Selectivity was measured using the covered codend technique, the cover being supported by circular hoops. The results were analysed taking into account the between-haul variation in selectivity. They demonstrated a substantial reduction in selectivity with increased twine size. For all the species considered, the lengths at 50% retention (L50) indicate that an increase in twine thickness from 2.38 turn (Rtex 3644) to 2.89 turn (Rtex 5312) reduces selectivity by 20-31%. Therefore, the twine thickness of the codend netting played an important role in selectivity. It is thus essential to include this factor in EU legislation aimed at improving codend selectivity in Mediterranean bottom trawl fisheries, where the recent trend towards using thicker twines threatens to cancel the benefit of the effect of mesh size increases or that of the square-mesh codend, allowing the present high rate of discarding small demersal fish to continue.

Most studies explore the current fauna or compare today's situation with that of 2 or 3 decades ago, when North Sea-wide information on benthos and fishing became available. However, in the North Sea, extensive mechanised trawling began more than a century ago. This study compared historical and recent records in order to explore potential long-term links between changes in the epibenthos and fishing. Based on reconstructed species lists from museum specimens, we compared epibenthos data from 1902 to 1912 with those from 1982 to 1985 and 2000. We analysed changes in average taxonomic distinctness (AvTD), a biodiversity indicator, and changes in biogeographical species distributions. Landings data were collated for round- and flatfish caught in the northern, central and southern North Sea from 1906 to 2000 as proxies for total otter and beam trawl effort, respectively. These indicate that the southern and much of the central North Sea were fished intensively throughout the 20th century, whilst the northern North Sea was less exploited, especially in earlier decades; exploitation intensified markedly from the 1960s onwards. For epibenthos, the mean AvTD decreased significantly from the 1980s to 2000, when it was below expected values in 4 ICES rectangles, 3 of these located in heavily trawled areas. Biogeographical changes from the beginning to the end of the century occurred in 27 of 48 taxa. In 14 taxa, spatial presence was reduced by 50% or more, most notably in the southern and central North Sea; often these were long-lived, slow-growing species with vulnerable shells or tests. By contrast, 12 taxa doubled their spatial presence throughout the North Sea. Most biogeographical changes had happened by the 1980s. Given that other important environmental changes, including eutrophication and climate change, have gained importance mainly from the 1980s onwards, we have concluded that the changes in epibenthos observed since the beginning of the 20th century have resulted primarily from intensified fisheries.";"Univ Swansea, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales; Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci Cefas, Ctr Environm, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England; IFM, GEOMAR, Leibniz Inst Marine Sci, D-24105 Kiel, Germany";;Callaway, R (corresponding author), Univ Swansea, Singleton Pk, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales.;r.m.callaway@swansea.ac.uk;Callaway, Ruth/P-6386-2016;Callaway, Ruth/0000-0001-9710-2940;;;54;56;61;0;31;INTER-RESEARCH;OLDENDORF LUHE;NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY;0171-8630;1616-1599;MAR ECOL PROG SER;Mar.

We used a coupled physical-ecological model (the European Regional Seas Ecosystem Model (ERSEM) with the General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM)) to investigate the impact of demersal trawling on the benthic and pelagic ecosystems of generic stratified and unstratified water columns in the central North Sea. Perturbation experiments were used to simulate trawling events using estimates of mortality of benthic fauna caused by different fishing gears in different habitats, derived from a meta-analysis of over 100 trawling disturbance experiments reported in the literature. The results suggest that the biogeochemical impact of demersal trawling is most significant in regions where gear type, trawl frequency and bed type cause high levels of filter feeder mortality. This results in substantially increased oxygen content of the benthic system and significant changes in its biogeochemistry (increased phosphorus absorption, increased nitrification of ammonia, reduced silicate cycling). The impacts of these changes on the overlying pelagic ecosystem are, however, buffered by the physical environment and the ability of phytoplankton to vary their internal cell nutrient contents.

While the cumulative effects of disturbance resulting from commercial trawling activities are poorly understood, several studies suggest that chronically disturbed communities are dominated by opportunistic organisms. This study focuses on changes in functional components of the benthic community occurring in muddy sediments in a NW Mediterranean trawling ground, including an area that has not been fished for 20 yr. In both disturbed and undisturbed areas, the overall benthic community from the fishing ground was dominated by burrowing epifaunal deposit feeders and predators, and deep burrowing infaunal deposit feeders. The fished area had a higher abundance of burrowing epifaunal scavengers and motile burrowing infauna, while the undisturbed area was characterised by higher abundance of surface infauna, epifaunal suspension feeders and predatory fish. This study clearly demonstrates that changes in the functional components of a benthic community can result from fishing in areas dominated by organisms not considered especially vulnerable to trawling activities. Thus, fisheries managers aiming to reduce ecosystem disturbance must consider the implications of trawling on the structure and functioning of all types of benthic communities.;"Inst Ciencies Mar, Barcelona 08003, Spain; Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Hamilton, New Zealand";;de Juan, S (corresponding author), Inst Ciencies Mar, Passeig Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, Barcelona 08003, Spain.;sdejuan@icm.csic.es;"de Juan Mohan, Silvia/P-2899-2019; Demestre, Montserrat/M-1719-2014";"de Juan Mohan, Silvia/0000-0002-8891-8371; Demestre, Montserrat/0000-0003-2866-4821; Thrush, Simon/0000-0002-4005-3882";;;51;146;148;0;35;INTER-RESEARCH;OLDENDORF LUHE;NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY;0171-8630;1616-1599;MAR ECOL PROG SER;Mar.

In this study, we present some biological parameters for the most common species collected during the fishing season. In Lebanon, juvenile pelagic fishes are attracted to floating lights and captured using purse seine nets. At least 32 species were collected but only 11 (mainly Engraulis encrasicolus, Sardina pilchardus, Sardinella aurita and Scomber japonicus) represented most of the catches. Weight-length relationships and different condition indices for common species were calculated. Most landed fishes were juveniles with a mean size of 11.3 +/- 8.8 cm TL. Fish conditions exhibited a similar temporal pattern with a minimum recorded in July, probably due to interspecific food competition in the nurseries. The monitored fishing vessel landed about 15 tonnes of juvenile fishes during the 4-month fishing season while fishing effort remained constant. Size-ranges and length-frequency distributions showed that the dominant sizes ranged between 6 and 8 cm TL and that harvested fishes are smaller than the minimum size fished in neighbouring Mediterranean countries. The Lebanese purse seine fishery targets 0 age-class juvenile of many fishes in the nurseries, which is against sustainable fishing practices and has a potential impact on pelagic fish communities in the eastern Mediterranean.

The surface area of the bays varied between 1 and 21 ha, and they were located along a clear exposure gradient reaching from an innermost bay system, where the surface water salinity was 1 parts per thousand-3 parts per thousand, to an outer archipelago, where salinity was around 5 parts per thousand-6 parts per thousand. The beach seine data demonstrated a change in dominance from freshwater species in the inner areas to marine species in the more exposed outer areas. Using the beach seine, the average number of YOY fish species in a single bay was 6.2 and the total number of YOY fish species caught was 17, while only four species were caught by detonation. Detonation sampling caught effectively only the YOY of some early spawning freshwater species, such as perch and roach. For these two species, both methods gave quite similar abundance patterns in the study bays. The YOY of some other common species, such as bleak and sticklebacks, were too small (8-22 mm) to be caught with the detonation method. The results demonstrated a rather low sampling precision with both methods even for the most abundant freshwater species, the main reason being that YOY fish are usually highly aggregated leading to a high frequency of zero samples.;Finnish Game & Fisheries Res Inst, FI-00791 Helsinki, Finland;;Lappalainen, A (corresponding author), Finnish Game & Fisheries Res Inst, POB 2, FI-00791 Helsinki, Finland.;;;;;;22;10;10;0;13;FINNISH ENVIRONMENT INST;HELSINKI;P O BOX 140, FIN-00251 HELSINKI, FINLAND;1239-6095;;BOREAL ENVIRON RES;Boreal Environ.

We develop linked state and pressure indicators that show the impact of bottom-trawling on benthic communities. The state indicator measures the proportion of an area where benthic invertebrate biomass (B) or production (P) is more than 90% of pristine benthic biomass (B-0.9) or production (P-0.9). The pressure indicator measures the proportion of the area where trawling frequency is sufficiently high to prevent reaching predicted B-0.9 or P-0.9. Time to recovery to B-0.9 and P-0.9 after trawling, depending on the habitat, was estimated using a validated size-based model of the benthic community. Based on trawling intensity in 2003, 53.5% of the southern North Sea was trawled too frequently for biomass to reach B-0.9, and 27.1% was trawled too frequently for production to reach P-0.9. As a result of bottom-trawling in 2003, in 56% of the southern North Sea benthic biomass was below B-0.9, whereas in 27% of the southern North Sea benthic production was below P-0.9. Modeled recovery times were comparable to literature estimates (2.5 to more than 6 years). The advantages of using the area with an ecological impact of trawling as a pressure indicator are that it is conceptually easy to understand, it responds quickly to changes in management action, it can be implemented at a relevant scale for fisheries management, and the necessary effort distribution data are centrally collected. One of this approach's greatest utilities, therefore, will be to communicate to policy makers and fishing enterprises the expected medium- to long-term ecological benefits that will accrue if the frequency of trawling in particular parts of fishing grounds is reduced.;"Univ Wales, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Anglesey, Wales; CEFAS, Lowestoft Lab, Lowestoft NR33 OHT, Suffolk, England";;Hiddink, JG (corresponding author), Univ Wales, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Anglesey, Wales.;J.Hiddink@bangor.ac.uk;"Kaiser, Michel J/M-8543-2013; Jennings, Simon/F-5085-2012; Hiddink, Jan Geert/C-1238-2009";"Jennings, Simon/0000-0002-2390-7225; Hiddink, Jan Geert/0000-0001-7114-830X; Kaiser, Michel Josef/0000-0001-8782-3621";;;44;62;65;0;47;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;1432-9840;1435-0629;ECOSYSTEMS;Ecosystems;NOV;2006;9;7;;;;1190;1199;;10.1007/s10021-005-0164-9;;;10;Ecology;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Environmental Sciences & Ecology;109UO;WOS:000242334600013;;;;;10/01/2022

The AHDs emitted pulses of 250-500-ms duration, worked at a frequency of 15 kHz, and a source level of 179 dB re 1 mu Pa rms at 1 m. AHDs were deployed during three consecutive fishing seasons. Catches were significantly higher in traps with AHDs (25.5kg d(-1)) than in controls (12.0 kg d(-1)), and catch damage was less (3.5 vs. 6.7 kg d(-1)). These results persisted over and between fishing seasons, but late in the season damage to the catches was common also in traps with AHDs. This study shows that the AHD may be a complementary mitigation tool in the seal-fishery conflict in certain types of fisheries, even though it is technically demanding, and for environmental reasons should be used with great care.

The Malmquist index, based on distance functions evaluated with Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), is often employed to estimate TFP changes. DEA is generally gaining attention for evaluating efficiency and capacity in fisheries. One main criticism of DEA is that it does not have any statistical foundation, i.e. that it is not possible to make inference about DEA scores or related parameters. The bootstrap method for estimating confidence intervals of deterministic parameters can however be applied to estimate confidence intervals for DEA scores. This method is applied in the present paper for assessing TFP changes between 1987 and 1999 for the fleet of Danish seiners operating in the North Sea and the Skagerrak.;Inst Food & Resource Econ, Fisheries Econ & Management Div, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark;;Hoff, A (corresponding author), Inst Food & Resource Econ, Fisheries Econ & Management Div, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.;ah@foi.dk;;;;;10;18;18;0;2;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0266-4763;1360-0532;J APPL STAT;J.

This was performed through experimental sea trials and computer simulations. The sea trials were carried out in the Adriatic Sea using a polyamide codend in order to assess its selectivity, to record morphological (height, width and length) and population size structure parameters of red mullet (Mullus barbatus). The selectivity process in the codend was also simulated with an individual-based model (PRESEMO) and a finite element model (FEMNET) to calculate the codend shapes. By adjusting the behavioural description of red mullet in the simulation, the model results reached an agreement with the experimental results. Next these, behavioural parameters were used in the simulation model to predict the effect of changing mesh size and number of meshes around in new codend designs. The predicted effect and the benefit of enforcing these designs on catch efficiency below and above minimum landing size (MLS) were investigated. The results confirm that the reduction of number of meshes in the codend circumference will be more beneficial than increasing the mesh size.;"CNR, ISMAR, Sede Ancona, I-60125 Ancona, Italy; IFREMER, F-29280 Plouzane, France; Danish Inst Fisheries Res, DIFRES, N Sea Ctr, DK-9850 Hirtshals, Denmark";;Sala, A (corresponding author), CNR, ISMAR, Sede Ancona, Largo Fiera della Pesca, I-60125 Ancona, Italy.;a.sala@ismar.cnr.it;"Sala, Antonello/B-8517-2016; priour, daniel/A-1921-2011; CNR, Ismar/P-1247-2014";"Sala, Antonello/0000-0001-7066-1152; Herrmann, Bent/0000-0003-1325-6198; CNR, Ismar/0000-0001-5351-1486; Priour, Daniel/0000-0001-7655-8279";;;24;26;26;0;10;EDP SCIENCES S A;LES ULIS CEDEX A;17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE;0990-7440;1765-2952;AQUAT LIVING RESOUR;Aquat.

Nevertheless, large quantities of undersized individuals and invertebrates are discarded in the Mediterranean multi-species bottom trawl fishery. The present work analyses the data from two surveys carried out on the shallow and deep continental shelf (50 - 78 m, and 147 - 189 m, respectively) off the Balearic Islands (western Mediterranean). In these surveys, the traditionally used 40 mm diamond mesh codend and an experimental square mesh codend were used under commercial conditions. Catch composition, yields, size selectivity of both target and by-catch species, and discards were compared between the two mesh types. The mean selection length (L-50) clearly increased for most species when using square mesh, escaping many more individuals under their minimum landing size. Yield of Spicara smaris was significantly lower by using the square mesh, changing the composition of the retained catch. Escapement ratio and economic loss were significantly higher with square mesh, although economic loss was almost negligible for both meshes on the deep continental shelf. The use of square mesh significantly reduced the discards of algae in the shallow waters and fish on the deep continental shelf. The results confirmed that square mesh codend reduces the fishing pressure on small specimens as well as the impact of trawling on the ecosystem. These benefits would not lead to a reduction of the yields neither of the main target species, the fishes Merluccius merluccius, Mullus surmuletus, Zeus faber, and the cephalopods Loligo vulgaris and Octopus vulgaris, nor of the rest of commercial categories, except for Spicara smaris.;"IEO Ctr Oceanog Balears, Palma de Mallorca 07015, Spain; Govern Illes Balears, Direccio Gen Pesca, Palma de Mallorca 07100, Spain";;Ordines, F (corresponding author), IEO Ctr Oceanog Balears, Moll Ponent S-N, Palma de Mallorca 07015, Spain.;xisco.ordinas@ba.ieo.es;"Guijarro, Beatriz/I-2480-2015; Massuti, Enric/AAG-5117-2021; Ordinas, Francesc/AAG-7079-2021";"Guijarro, Beatriz/0000-0002-2083-4681; Ordines, F.

In order to allow repeated sampling of the same area, a rig of three beam trawls one behind the other was constructed, the three being tied together by steel ropes. Catching efficiency was estimated on the basis of the sum of the catches of all three trawls relative to the numbers caught in the first trawl. The catching efficiency of the beam trawl for epifauna ranged from 36% to 44% of total abundance between sites. Efficiency was least for partly buried species (Liocarcinus holsatus, 9% and 18%; Buglossidum luteum, 27%; Arnoglossus laterna, 35%), and slightly better for species living on the surface of the sediment (Asterias rubens, 42% and 46%; Pomato-schistus minutus, 58% and 46%; Pagurus bernhardus, 51%). The abundance of epifauna will be underestimated by a factor of 1.4-11 relative to the abundance in the three trawls. Also, sediment type seems to influence the catching efficiency of the beam trawl, efficiency being less at the sandy study site than at the muddy site for most species.

The stomach contents of fish caught on the continental shelf were examined, and differences in the diet in relation to age-class, season and depth were studied. The age-classes were grouped according to a cluster analysis of diet composition. As a result, three groups were obtained: the first two corresponded to juveniles between 2 and 7 years old, and the third one corresponded to adults between 8 and 15 years old. Although Micromesistius poulassou was an important prey for all ages, the youngest black anglerfish fed mainly on small benthic fish. In contrast, large prey species such as Phycis blennoides and Merluccius merluccius were eaten almost exclusively by adults. The diet composition changed during the year. The changes in the diet of black anglerfish older than 3 years were more related to seasonal differences than to between-size differences. These seasonal shifts were mainly marked by the varying importance of Trachurus trachurus and M. merluccius in their diet. Feeding intensity also showed seasonal variations, with a significant decrease in autumn. An indirect effect of depth on the feeding ecology of black anglerfish was also found, since both age and diet composition changed with depth.;Ctr Oceanog Santander, E-39080 Santander, Spain;;Preciado, I (corresponding author), Ctr Oceanog Santander, Promontorio San Martin S-N,POB 240, E-39080 Santander, Spain.;ipreciado@st.ieo.es;"Velasco, Francisco/S-3229-2016; Preciado, Izaskun/K-9029-2014";"Velasco, Francisco/0000-0002-6420-9474; Preciado, Izaskun/0000-0002-0934-9423";;;25;35;37;0;18;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;NEW YORK;32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA;0025-3154;;J MAR BIOL ASSOC UK;J.

Indicators are required to support the development of this approach. For example, community indicators have been proposed to assess the impact of fishing. We tested here the applicability of one such community indicator, the abundance-biomass comparison (ABC method), as a measure of the impact of bottom trawling (years of sampling: 2001 and 2003) on the benthic invertebrates-typically starfishes, crabs, squat lobsters, shrimps and large hard-shelled molluscs-of Grande Vasiere, a major French fishing zone, in the Bay of Biscay. The ABC method is generally used as an impact indicator for different types of physical, biological and anthropogenic disturbances on benthic communities. This method is based on the assumption that increasing disturbance shifts communities from dominance by large-bodied species with low turnover rates toward dominance by small-bodied species with high turnover rates. At less disturbed areas the average biomass of individuals is greater than at more heavily disturbed areas. The ABC method measures this effect by comparing the ranked distributions of abundance and biomass within a given community. We applied the ABC method and compared the size structure and the species diversity at two areas exposed to moderate and high bottom trawl effort. Species diversity was lower in the most exploited area. The highly trawled area was dominated by opportunistic organisms, mainly one species of swimming crab Liocarcinus depurator, one species of squat lobster Munida rugosa and Norway lobsters Nephrops norvegicus, which are large-bodied species. Consequently, the results of the ABC method were inconsistent with the theoretical expectation for these particular macrofaunal communities and the measured levels of fishing intensity.;"IFREMER, Dept Halieut Mediterraneen & Trop, Cayenne 97331, French Guiana; Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England";;Blanchard, F (corresponding author), IFREMER, Dept Halieut Mediterraneen & Trop, Domaine de Suzini,BP 477, Cayenne 97331, French Guiana.;Fabian.Blanchard@ifremer.fr;;Blanchard, Fabian/0000-0001-8496-877X;;;29;13;24;0;18;EDP SCIENCES S A;LES ULIS CEDEX A;17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE;0990-7440;;AQUAT LIVING RESOUR;Aquat.

Approximately one third of the cod and a quarter of the haddock available to the trawl escaped. Cod escape rates were highly length-dependent, following a sigmoid curve with an estimated length at 50% escape of 38.5 cm and interquartile width of 34.1 cm. Length dependence was less pronounced in haddock. The escape rate of saithe was not length-dependent, and on average 7% passed under the trawl's fishing line. Fish abundance had no observable effects on escape rates.

In each area, we conducted, in 1999-2000, seasonal, experimental fishing trials at various depths with trammel nets of six different inner/outer panel mesh combinations (i.e., two large outer panel meshes and three small inner panel meshes). Overall, our study covered some of the most commonly used inner panel mesh sizes, ranging from 40 to 140 mm (stretched). We analysed the species composition and catch rates of the different inner/outer panel combinations with regression, multivariate analysis (cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling) and other 'community' techniques (number of species, dominance curves). All our analyses indicated that the outer panel mesh sizes used in the present study did not significantly affect the catch characteristics in terms of number of species, catch rates and species composition. Multivariate analyses and seasonal dominance plots indicated that in Basque, Algarve and Cyclades waters, where sampling covered wide depth ranges, both season and depth strongly affected catch species compositions. For the Gulf of Cadiz, where sampling was restricted to depths 10-30 m, season was the only factor affecting catch species composition and thus group formation. In contrast, the inner panel mesh size did not generally affect multidimensional group formation in all areas but affected the dominance of the species caught in the Algarve and the Gulf of Cadiz. Multivariate analyses also revealed 11 different metiers (i.e., season-depth-species-inner panel mesh size combinations) in the four areas. This clearly indicated the existence of trammel net 'hot spots', which represent essential habitats (e.g., spawning, nursery or wintering grounds) of the life history of the targeted and associated species. The number of specimens caught declined significantly with inner panel mesh size in all areas. We attributed this to the exponential decline in abundance with size, both within- and between-species. In contrast, the number of species caught in each area was not related to the inner mesh size. This was unexpected and might be a consequence of the wide size-selective range of trammel nets.

These metiers were: cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) and soles (Solea senegalensis, Microchirus azevia, Synaptura lusitanica) in the Algarve and the Gulf of Cadiz, sole (Solea solea) in the Cantabrian Sea and mixed fin-fish in the Cyclades. In each area, experimental trammel nets of six different types (combinations of two large outer panel mesh sizes and three small inner panel meshes) were constructed. Fishing trials were carried out on a seasonal basis (four seasons in the Cantabrian Sea, Algarve and Cyclades and two seasons in the Gulf of Cadiz) with chartered commercial fishing vessels. Overall, size selectivity was estimated for 17 out of 28 species for which sufficient data were available. Trammel nets generally caught a wide size range of the most important species, with length frequency distributions that were skewed to the right and/or bi-modal. In many cases the length frequency distributions of the different nets were highly overlapped. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test also showed that the large outer panel meshes generally had no effect in terms of size selectivity, while the opposite was true for the small inner panel ones. Six different selectivity models (normal scale, normal location, gamma, log-normal, bi-modal and gamma semi-Wileman) were fitted to data for the most abundant species in the four areas. For fish, the bi-modal model provided the best fits for the majority of the data sets, with the uni-modal models giving poor fits in most cases. For Sepia officinalis, where trammelling or pocketing was the method of capture in 100% of the cases, the logistic model fitted by maximum likelihood was judged to be more appropriate for describing the size selective properties of the trammel nets. Our results, which are among the first ones on trammel net selectivity in European waters, will be useful for evaluating the impacts of competing gear for the socio-economically important small-scale static gear fisheries.

Three cruises were conducted on the same fishing grounds using the same fishing gear on board the same commercial trawler in April 1995, September 1995, and February 1996. The periods coincided with postspawning in April, post-summer feeding in September, and prespawning in February. The seawater temperature at the seabed on the fishing grounds was near its annual maximum in September (12.2 degrees C) and annual minimum in February (7.2 degrees C) and in April (7 degrees C). There was significant variation in selectivity of haddock with month and total catch in the codend. Fish length and, for two of the three cruises, fish maximum girth were used as variables in selectivity analysis. The probability of being retained was lowest in September, when the fish were in good condition and water temperature was highest, but girth was also largest (50% retention length L50 = 33.5 cm; girth at L50 = 172 mm). The retention probability was intermediate in February when the water was cold and the fish were prespawning, again with relatively large girths (L50 = 31.3 cm; girth at L50 = 158 mm). The retention probability was highest in April when the fish were postspawning, the water was cold, and the fish had the smallest girth (L50 = 27.3 cm; girth at L50 = 129 mm). Although care was taken to maintain similar conditions during all trips, there were some differences between April and the other months. Overall, retention was not related simply to girth and length. In September and February, at constant girth, codend retention increased with length, suggesting that within a given month, fish condition has an effect on selectivity. However, at constant length an increase in girth in February led to an increase in retention, but in September to a decrease in retention. A possible explanation is that, in February, the girth of a fish increases owing to its sexual maturity, whereas in September, increased girth is due to maximum volume of somatic tissue. Water temperature and volume of fish muscle affect the maximum rate and power of swimming. Swimming ability may be a significant factor in determining selectivity.

In the period 2000-2001, 73 commercial dredgers harvested the resource within the sandy coastal area of the Ancona Maritime District (central Adriatic Sea). Despite this, no study aimed at investigating the impact of the fishery on the macrobenthic community of the area has ever been carried out. Sampling was done at 6 monthly intervals in an attempt to relate the impact of hydraulic dredging to different levels of fishing intensity. Data regarding two depth strata (4-6; 7-10 m) were analysed separately by means of permutational multivariate analysis of variance. The results revealed an overall condition of moderate disturbance within the benthic community, especially so within the 4-6 m depth stratum. The response of the benthic community to varying intensities of fishing activity was rapid, occurring within 6 months. Differences in the response of benthic community to differing intensities of fishing activity were found between the two depth strata considered. Significant differences in multivariate location of the benthic community were revealed between the three disturbance levels in both depth strata. Differences in multivariate dispersion were detected above a threshold level of fishing intensity, only within the shallow community. Differences were found between depth strata relating to species diversity and evenness, with significant differences between levels of fishing intensity being evident only within the 4-6 m depth stratum. The results emphasised that, even in a benthic community that is typical of a moderately disturbed environment, the effects of fishing on community structure were still discernible over and above the natural variation.";"CNR, Ist Sci Marine, Sez Pesca Marittima, I-60125 Ancona, Italy; Univ Marine Biol Stn, Millport KA28 0EG, Isle Cumbrae, Scotland";;Morello, EB (corresponding author), CNR, Ist Sci Marine, Sez Pesca Marittima, Largo Fiera Pesca, I-60125 Ancona, Italy.;b.morello@ismar.cnr.it;CNR, Ismar/P-1247-2014;"CNR, Ismar/0000-0001-5351-1486; FROGLIA, Carlo/0000-0003-0447-7802";;;68;14;15;0;18;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0025-3162;;MAR BIOL;Mar.

We conducted a large-scale assessment of bottom trawl fishing of benthic fauna in different habitats, using a theoretical, size-based model that included habitat features. Species richness was estimated based on a generalized body mass versus species richness relationship. The model was validated by sampling 33 stations subject to a range of trawling intensities in four shallow, soft sediment areas in the North Sea. Both the model and the field data demonstrated that trawling reduced biomass, production, and species richness. The impacts of trawling were greatest in areas with low levels of natural disturbance, while the impact of trawling was small in areas with high rates of natural disturbance. For the North Sea, the model showed that the bottom trawl fleet reduced benthic biomass and production by 56% and 21%, respectively, compared with an unfished situation. Because of the many simplifications and assumptions required to synthesize these data, additional work is required to refine the model and evaluate applicability in other geographic areas.

Data were collected on a monthly basis (January-December 2001) through embarks on board of a commercial fishing vessel, so as to reflect commercial fishing practice. The three species represented from 7 to 31% of the discarded biomass, varying with season. Density and biomass indices were characterised by a clear seasonality, each species showing a peak in a different period of the year. A six level scale, based on macroscopic external injuries was used to assess the damage sustained by each species after fishing and sorting operations. For the three species, very similar percentages (56-58%) of individuals were macroscopically intact, while inspection of damaged individuals revealed some differences in the distribution of injuries. G. rhomboides showed the highest proportion of serious damage, followed by L. depurator and M. lanata. The severity and frequency of damage was mainly correlated with interspecific and intraspecific (sexual dimorphism) morphological and behavioural characteristics. For example, specimens with longer and thin appendages, like males of G. rhomboides, seemed to be particularly vulnerable to the fishing and sorting operations; this could also explain the positive correlation between damage level and size found in this species. In M. lanata, small individuals proved to be more vulnerable, while for L. depurator no significant correlation was found between damage and size. Although these estimations did not take other injury typologies into account (e.g. internal and physiological damage), these results can be seen as a first indirect estimation of discard mortality for these species and can represent an important term of reference both for similar studies performed in other areas and for the monitoring of this fishery.";"Ctr Interuniv Biol Marina & Ecol Applicata, I-57128 Livorno, Italy; APLYSIA pscrl, I-57124 Livorno, Italy";;Sartor, P (corresponding author), Ctr Interuniv Biol Marina & Ecol Applicata, Viale N Sauro 4, I-57128 Livorno, Italy.;psartor@cibm.it;;;;;33;7;8;1;9;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0018-8158;;HYDROBIOLOGIA;Hydrobiologia;MAR;2006;557;;;;;121;133;;10.1007/s10750-005-1315-x;;;13;Marine & Freshwater Biology;"Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)";Marine & Freshwater Biology;999SK;WOS:000234410600016;;;;;10/01/2022

There was no difference in the catch composition or the yield that could be attributable to mesh shape, although the percentage of total and commercial species discarded with a diamond mesh was higher than with a square mesh. At least in the short term, the escapement ratio and the economic loss with the diamond mesh were lower than with square mesh, but economic efficiency was no different between them. For all the main species compared, except one flatfish, size selectivity parameters were lower for the diamond- than for the square-mesh codend. Selectivity values for the one flatfish species were similar. From the results it is concluded that, within the context of precautionary management, introduction of a 40-mm square mesh in the codend could be an appropriate and plausible measure to improve the state of the resources exploited by the deepwater crustacean trawl fishery of the upper slope off the Balearic Islands, and to reduce the impact of the fishery on the ecosystem.

One aspiration of the ecosystem approach to management is to conserve function as well as biodiversity, but trawling impacts on benthic community function need to be understood before they can be managed. Here we present the large scale and long term impact of chronic trawling on the functional composition of benthic invertebrate communities using a comprehensive set of functional traits. The effects of chronic trawling disturbance on the functional composition of faunal benthic invertebrate communities, as sampled with a small beam trawl, were investigated at 6 to 13 sites in each of 4 contrasting regions of the North Sea. Each site was subject to known levels of trawling disturbance. Information on the life history and ecological function traits of the taxa sampled was translated into fuzzy coding and used to analyse the relationship between life history and functional roles within the ecosystem. Multivariate analyses were used to examine changes in the distribution of traits over gradients of trawling intensity. Changes in the functional structure of the community due to the effects of long-term trawling were identified in 3 of the 4 areas sampled. Filter-feeding, attached and larger animals were relatively more abundant in lightly trawled areas, while areas with higher levels of trawling were characterised by a higher relative biomass of mobile animals and infaunal and scavenging invertebrates. Univariate analysis of selected traits confirmed the patterns observed in multivariate analysis. These results demonstrate that chronic bottom trawling can lead to large scale shifts in the functional composition of benthic communities, with likely effects on the functioning of coastal ecosystems.;"Univ Wales, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Anglesey, Wales; CEFAS, Lowestoft Lab, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England";;Hiddink, JG (corresponding author), Univ Wales, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Anglesey, Wales.;j.hiddink@bangor.ac.uk;"Jennings, Simon/F-5085-2012; Langhamer, Olivia/J-3425-2012; Hiddink, Jan Geert/C-1238-2009; Kaiser, Michel J/M-8543-2013";"Jennings, Simon/0000-0002-2390-7225; Hiddink, Jan Geert/0000-0001-7114-830X; Kaiser, Michel Josef/0000-0001-8782-3621";;;70;227;231;2;88;INTER-RESEARCH;OLDENDORF LUHE;NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY;0171-8630;1616-1599;MAR ECOL PROG SER;Mar.

The different configurations were: (i) bottom trawl, with bobbin for ground rope (Rockhopper): (ii) bottom trawl, without bobbin (Medits); and (iii) pelagic trawl, towed at 1 and 10m above the seabed. The plumes of resuspended sediment were measured using the acoustic backscattered intensity, from a towed ADCP. Concomitant profiles of particle size-distribution, light transmission and water samples were collected, outside and inside the plumes. The analysis of the data enabled derivation of the major physical and chemical characteristics of the plumes generated by the trawls; likewise, and to quantify the resuspension fluxes of sediment, particulate (PN, POC) and dissolved (nutrients) elements. The residence time and dispersal of the plumes were monitored and modelled, considering the settling velocity of the particulate matter and the near-bottom turbulence. The results indicate that the bottom trawls produce significant resuspension, whilst the near-bottom and mid-water pelagic trawls have no impact upon the sediment. The sediment clouds at several hundreds metres astern of the bottom trawls are 3-6m high and 70-200m, wide; they were generated both by the otter doors and the net. The average suspended sediment concentrations measured in the plumes reach 50 mg l(-1). Resuspension fluxes of sediment along the path of the trawls range from 190 g m(-2) s(-1), for the coarsest sediment (clayey silt) to 800 g m(-2) s(-1) for the finest sediment (silty clay). Whilst the resuspended loads of dissolved elements (nutrients) within the plume segment suggest a release of porewater, present at least in the first few centimetres of sediment, the particulate matter load only resulted from the resuspension of less than 1 mm thickness of the sediment bed. This discrepancy shows that a very small fraction of the sediment ploughed by the trawl is effectively injected into the water column. The monitoring of the settling of the plumes indicates a rapid decay of the sediment load, during the first hour after its generation. Some of the sediment (about 10-15% of the initial load) remains in suspension; this is due, probably, to the near-bottom turbulence that prevents the redeposition of the fine particles and aggregates. Lateral spreading of the plume is strongly dependent upon the variability of horizontal currents. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Meiofauna, which are among the smallest benthic organisms, may be more resistant to disturbance by trawling since they are likely to be re-suspended rather than killed by trawls. Their short generation times allow populations to withstand elevated mortality. In this study, we determined the effect of trawling disturbance, season and sediment type on the structure of meiofaunal communities in a commercial fishing ground in Thermaikos Gulf, north Aegean Sea, Greece. The trawling season is limited to 8 months between October and May. A grid of five nearshore stations was chosen along a north-south productivity gradient and an additional offshore station was included as a reference point. Sediment chemistry and meiofaunal community structure were studied before the trawling season started, as well as I and 4 months after the initiation of the fishing period. Results showed that there were no short term (30 days) trawling impacts on meiofauna in terms of abundance and community structure but that there were recognizable effects on the community structure of nematodes and the abundance of polychaetes. In contrast, most meiofaunal taxa displayed significant seasonal variability, 4 months after the initiation of the fishing period; however, other closely related factors such as temperature, sediment particle size and primary productivity are more likely to be responsible for the observed patterns.

Overall discards comprised just under 50% of total catch in both Maritime Districts, approximately 30% of which were undersized target species (< 25 mm) and 20% other benthic invertebrates, whilst fish were poorly represented. Significant differences in the proportions of the different catch components were found between the two Maritime Districts considered. Similarly, the size-frequencies of landed catch were significantly different between Districts. Great variability in overall catch composition from one Zone to another within one District was detected, emphasising the importance of a Zone-based management, rather than a District-based management. Analysis of the invertebrate component of discards revealed a clear segregation of the benthic community according to depth. Future management plans should thus incorporate a bathymetric component and future research should focus on identifying species particularly sensitive to this kind of disturbance.

A model was developed for the calculation of seal-induced losses in set traps for salmon. The model compared catches on consecutive days or day-pairs. It was found that the total losses in set traps were high: 61% of the potential catch in a trend-adjusted sample of paired data. A significant part of these losses, such as fish wholly removed from gear was hidden. The traditional method of assessing losses by counting the remains of fish underestimated losses by 46%. The scaring effect of seal visits was not included. The model was also used for an analysis of the damage process. There were significant negative after-effects of seal visits on catch levels. It was also found that seal visits co-occur with salmon runs. It seems that seals prefer smaller to larger salmon when raiding traps. It is suggested that the traditional method of estimating losses by counting fish remains should be calibrated when used and that the new model with day-pairs should be tried in analyses of seal interference in other fishing operations.

More than 20 000 tracks were analysed in terms of velocity changes in vertical, athwarthship, and alongship direction relative to the vessel, the warps, and the trawl, respectively. The fish starts diving about 15 min before vessel passing. This coincides with the time the trawl is running and not with the gradual increase in vessel noise caused by the approaching vessel. The change in horizontal movement is more gradual and is directed away from the vessel in the alongship direction, but towards the vessel in the athwarthship direction. The strongest and sharpest response is related to the trawl warps. A strong herding in front of the warps is seen. Closer to the bottom, an athwarthship herding reaction is seen away from the trawl doors or possibly the lower parts of the warps. There were only minor differences when grouping the tracks according to light level, fish size, and fish density.;"Inst Marine Res, N-5817 Bergen, Norway; Univ Bergen, Dept Math, N-5020 Bergen, Norway";;Handegard, NO (corresponding author), Inst Marine Res, POB 1870 Nordnes, N-5817 Bergen, Norway.;nilsolav@imr.no;Handegard, Nils Olav/I-3047-2012;Handegard, Nils Olav/0000-0002-9708-9042;;;40;60;61;1;13;CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING;OTTAWA;65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA;0706-652X;1205-7533;CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI;Can.

Several experiments have been carried out in order to estimate the survival-rate of the small-spotted catshark caught by commercial trawlers in this area. The estimate of mean survival-rate from tagging surveys was 90% while from commercial trawlers it was 78%. Several factors potentially influencing the survival-rate (sex, length, maximum depth fished, sorting time and trawl duration) were examined. No significant differences in survival-rates were found between males and females, and no strong relationships between survival-rate and depth fished, sorting time or trawl duration were evident.

Seventy-three commercial dredgers harvest the resource within the sandy coastal area of the Ancona Maritime District (central Adriatic Sea). Despite this chronic disturbance, studies aimed at investigating the impacts of the fishery on the macrobenthic community of the area have never been carried out. To remedy this, sampling was accomplished within an area of the District from which hydraulic dredging was banned, within the framework of a balanced beyond-BACI (before/after, control/impact) experimental design. Data regarding seven groups of species were analysed separately by means of permutational multivariate analysis of variance. No impacts attributable to hydraulic dredging were found upon consideration of the entire sampled macrobenthic community, the Polychaeta, the Crustacea, detritivores, and suspensivores. In contrast, a sustained press impact of fishing was revealed for the Mollusca, and the bivalve Abra alba was found to be particularly susceptible. Abra alba was suggested as a possible impact indicator. A short-lived pulse impact on the predator and scavenger trophic guild was observed and was limited to the 1st sampling day after experimental hydraulic dredging.;"CNR, Ist Sci Marine, Sez Pesca Marittima, I-60125 Ancona, Italy; Univ Marine Biol Stn, Millport KA28 0EG, Isle Of Cumbrae, Scotland";;Morello, EB (corresponding author), CNR, Ist Sci Marine, Sez Pesca Marittima, Largo Fiera della Pesca, I-60125 Ancona, Italy.;b.morello@ismar.cnr.it;CNR, Ismar/P-1247-2014;"CNR, Ismar/0000-0001-5351-1486; FROGLIA, Carlo/0000-0003-0447-7802";;;67;32;33;0;23;CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING;OTTAWA;65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA;0706-652X;1205-7533;CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI;Can.

Discarded animals (normally < 25-35 mm carapace length) were sampled immediately after capture, and following emersion (exposure to air) on deck for I or 2 h. Their recovery from, and survival of, the stresses of being fished were examined in separate groups of animals transferred by SCUBA divers to underwater (u/w) cages on the seabed at a mean depth of 24 m. Escaped N. norvegicus were collected in a small-meshed (40 mm) cover around the cod-end and sampled without emersion. It was assumed that the physiological state of these animals would be similar to those passing through the cod-end meshes directly back into the surrounding sea during normal fishing operations. Groups of escaped animals were also transferred to u/w cages for recovery and survival studies. Control animals (creel-caught from the same fishing grounds) were sampled after recovery in u/w cages. Total body water content, haemolymph (blood) volume and composition were examined at various stages after capture and during recovery of control, discarded and escaped animals. Discarded animals showed significant reductions in total body water content compared to controls but recovered after 24 h. Controls that had been artificially damaged by puncturing also showed a reduction in water content. Escaped animals showed significantly higher mean water content compared to discards. Haemolymph volumes were also reduced in discarded animals suggesting that significant blood loss occurs during capture. There was also evidence of a shift of fluid from haemolymph to tissues in discarded animals. Pericardial (haemolymph) pressures were much reduced in discards compared to undisturbed control animals but showed significant recovery in surviving animals. Pressure reduction was less in escapes but was seen in control animals that had been exercised to exhaustion. Haemolymph osmotic concentrations, [Na+] and [K+] showed increases after discarding, notably after emersion, but haemocyanin [Hcy] and total haemolymph protein concentrations were less affected. The effect of these changes on longer term survival and recovery from the stress of capture are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Undersized discards (< 25-35 mm carapace length) were sampled directly from the cod-end and following recovery in underwater (u/w) cages at a mean depth of 24 m. Escaped animals which had passed through the cod-end meshes and collected in a small-meshed net cover were transferred without emersion (air-exposure) for sampling on-board. Some of these individuals were also transferred by SCUBA divers to u/w cages. Haemolymph PO2, PCO2 and pH measurements showed that both discarded and escaped animals experienced moderate internal hypoxia, hypercapnia and acidosis which became severe after 1 h emersion of the former on deck. A marked handling effect was evident in which haemolymph PO2 declined and PCO2 became elevated in both controls and recovering trawled animals. In both discarded and escaped animals haemolymph L-lactate and D-glucose concentrations were high compared to controls, but with levels significantly lower in escapes suggesting less tail-flip swimming activity within the cod-end cover. Further emersion had little effect on haemolymph L-lactate in discards. Recovery to control levels of both metabolites occurred within 24 h in u/w cages but the exercising of captured individuals (by tactile stimulation) produced further significant increases. Abdominal flexor muscle concentrations of L-lactate were also elevated in discards and escapes and positively correlated with haemolymph levels. Muscle glycogen showed severe depletion in both groups compared to unexercised controls and 1 h emersion reduced levels drastically (to similar to 20% of normal concentrations). High haemolymph ammonia (T-amm) was characteristic of both trawled groups but was reduced rapidly during recovery. These metabolite changes were accompanied by reductions in the number of escape swimming tail-flips that could be elicited before exhaustion, particularly in discards. This reduction in performance was evident in discards even after 24 h recovery, but escapes showed almost normal responses. The severity of the physiological stresses experienced during trawling, and to a lesser extent in escaped animals, and their effects on recovery of undersized discards regaining the seabed, is discussed. These findings may help us predict the survival, longer-term recovery and fitness of fished N. norvegicus, and their potential contribution to the regeneration of exploited populations.

Most damage is induced by a rapidly growing grey seal (Hatichoerus grypus) population. We evaluated seal damage in the coastal trap-net fishery of the Gulf of Bothnia, where different gear constructions and netting materials are used. A total of 72 commercial fishermen with 136 trap-nets were involved in the study. Catch and gear-damage observations made by fishermen were consistent with our own. The largest catch losses of salmon (Salmo salar) were recorded in the Bothnian Sea, where seals damaged at least 37% of salmon catch (by number). In other regions, losses were notably smaller, at between 3 and 9%. The number of salmon caught in a trap on any one occasion correlated significantly with the number of damaged salmon. However, the more salmon were present in a trap, the smaller was the proportion damaged by seals. Observed catch losses in the whitefish (Coregonus sp.) fishery varied between regions from 5 to 7%. Gear damage was observed in 2-15% of trap-net emptyings, depending largely on region. The extent of gear damage followed the trend of catch damage in each region. Fish entanglement in trap-nets increased the amount of gear damage. The type of netting material significantly affected gear-damage frequencies and salmon entanglement. Seal-induced catch and gear damage could be reduced by gear modification and operational changes. The choice of suitable netting materials and the development of seal-safe fish-bags are essential in protecting the gear and catch from seals. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The intertidal mudflat surface has been seriously reduced (<30 km(2)) since the channels of the Seine River came under management. While the role of the Seine estuary in the dynamics of the eastern English Channel ecosystem is recognized as important, the biological characteristics of the estuary remained relatively unknown until the 1990s. Biological diversity was progressively impoverished from the polyhaline zone to the oligohaline zone. In spite of a heavily contaminated environment, the macrobenthic and planktonic fauna of the Seine estuary remains similar to those of other northeastern Atlantic estuaries. The fauna exhibit clear contrasts between areas with very high abundance and others with very low abundance. The pelagic fauna, especially the copepod Eurytemora affinis and the shrimp Palaemon longirostris, are more abundant in the Seine estuary than in other estuaries. Diversified and abundant, Abra alba-Pectinaria koreni and Macoma balthica benthic communities occur, respectively, in the outer and inner parts of the estuary. In subtidal flats, benthic fauna is especially poor in terms of specific richness, abundance and biomass. Paradoxically, considering the high abundance of prey, fish are particularly scarce. Two food webs have been identified. In the oligohaline zone, where turbidity is maximum, the food web is exclusively planktonic, due to dredging that prevented benthic fauna from settling. In the polyhaline zone, fish populations that feed particularly on benthic fauna benefit from low turbidity and high oxygen concentrations. So, in spite of heavy organic and metallic contamination and human activities, the Seine estuary remains a highly productive ecosystem, which provides a nursery for marine fish and feeding grounds for migratory birds. A global management plan appears to be necessary in order to guarantee that the Seine estuary continues to function as it currently does.;ELICO, CNRS, UMR8013, Stn Marine Wimereux, F-62930 Wimereux, France;;Dauvin, JC (corresponding author), ELICO, CNRS, UMR8013, Stn Marine Wimereux, BP 80, F-62930 Wimereux, France.;dauvin@pop.univ-lille1.fr;;Nicolas, Desroy/0000-0002-9047-5637;;;44;57;58;2;39;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0018-8158;1573-5117;HYDROBIOLOGIA;Hydrobiologia;May/15;2005;540;;;;;13;27;;10.1007/s10750-004-7101-3;;;15;Marine & Freshwater Biology;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Marine & Freshwater Biology;963KY;WOS:000231804400002;;;;;10/01/2022

A different bathymetric distribution of abundance was observed by comparing the main taxonomic groups. Six main species assemblages were identified, primarily associated with depth but also with different macro-epibenthic communities.

Three codend types were tested: a 120 mm diamond mesh codend, a Danish type 105 mm escape window codend, and a 105 mm square mesh top-panel codend (Bacoma-window). In total, 30 tows were carried out in three different experiments. Mean tow duration was 3 h and average codend catch 536 kg (range 47-2592 kg). Escapees were collected during the last 20 min of each haul by a caging method. These fish were then held in cages anchored on the seabed and checked daily by divers. Average number of escapees in cage was 133. Average caging duration was 9.5 days. The mortality of escapees was low in normal water temperatures (<10 degreesC) in all codend types. Higher mortalities were observed when cages were held in temperatures above 15 degreesC. The majority of these deaths occurred during the first day after the tow. Apparently, these fish experienced strong thermal stress when they were towed to the cage release site through the thermal stratification layer. In commercial trawling the tow is usually not directed to shallow waters. A somewhat higher mortality was predicted for larger fish that escaped from the 120 mm diamond mesh codend while in the 105 mm escape window codend the effect was reverse. In the Bacoma-window codend the number of dead escapees was very low in all length groups. We did not find any clear difference in skin injury between the three codend types. The predicted escape mortality was somewhat higher with higher codend catches. We conclude that the mortality of Baltic cod codend escapees is low in the normal water temperature (3-9 degreesC).

Scup discards were high in directed scup tows regardless of codend mesh-typically one to five times tie weight of landings. The weight of scup discards in the present study did not differ significantly from that recorded in scup-targeted tows in the NMFS observer database. Most discards were required as such by the 22.86 cm TL (total length) fish-size limit for catches. Mesh sizes less than or equal to12.7 cm, including the current legal mesh size (11.43 cm) did not adequately filter out scup, smaller than 22.86 cm. The median length of scup discards was about 19.83 cm TL. Lowering the legal size for scup from 22.86 to 19.83 cm TL would greatly reduce discard mortality. Scup discards were a small fraction (0.4%) of black sea bass (Centropristis striata) landings in blacksea-bass -targeted tows. The black sea bass fishery is currently regulated under the small-mesh fishery gearrestricted area plan in which fishing is prohibited in some areas to reduce scup mortality. Our study found no evidence to support the efficacy of this management approach. The expectations:ions that discarding would increase disproportionately as the trip limit (limit [in kilograms] on catch for a species) was reached towards the end of the trip and that discards would increase when the trip limit was red iced from 4536 kg to 454 kg at the (end of the directed fishing season were not supported.

Both short- and long-term processes (e.g. investment) impact fleet dynamics. The proposed structure of the models has tended to depend upon the nature of the fishery and the control variables (technical restrictions, quotas, effort control, and/or closed areas). For example, within the context of tnulti-stock. multi-fleet fisheries (mixed fisheries), a skipper will allocate effort (as input to the production process) to harvest a range of species. Spatial complexity is normally excluded in models of behaviour. In this paper, two spatial analyses are presented for modelling location choice: an analysis based on a random utility model (RUM). and a simplified simulation model of individual vessels that depends on the results of the RUM. These models are applied to the English beam-trawl fleet operating in the North Sea in 2000. The results from the RUM indicate that the number of trips, the average trip length, and the average effort in each ICES rectangle are significant variables affecting location choice. in addition to catch rate for the previous year (1999), weighted by value. The last result is used as an assumption in a simulation model of fishing effort, i.e. fishers make decisions on spatial location of operation on the basis of past catch rates. The simulation model is used to predict the distribution of the same fleet for one month during the temporary closure in the North Sea in 2001.

Results indicate that the north Adriatic Sea, and especially the north-east part, is a very important foraging and overwintering habitat for loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta). Since the distribution of fishing effort in the area is not known, the total turtle catch by the Italian bottom trawl fleet was conservatively estimated from the lower catch rate observed in the south-west sub-area: 4273 turtle captures/year (95% C.I. = 2186-8546). The actual total catch in the whole north Adriatic is likely to be much higher, due both to an unknown Italian trawling effort in the south-west part with multi-gear vessels and to the Italian and Croatian trawling efforts in the north-east part, where catch rate was 15 times greater than in the south-west part. In the south-west sub-area 9.4% of captured turtles were dead and potential mortality (assuming that all comatose turtles would die too) was 43.8%. Hence, trawling in the north Adriatic is likely to represent a serious threat to the populations, and possible conservation measures are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

During an experiment west of Bear Island in summer 2001, the total selectivity of a commercial cod trawl with a single grid mounted (grid selectivity x codend selectivity) was compared with that of the same trawl without a grid (codend selectivity). This is the first comparison of the selectivity of these gears during a single experiment. The results showed a surprisingly similar selection range for grid and codend selectivity: around 10 cm. With a grid mounted, the 50% retention length of the trawl rose by about 4 cm. The results demonstrate that catch rate or catch size may influence both 50% retention length and selection range.

In this study, we analysed records front 1938 trawl stations from the annual Norwegian winter surveys in the Barents Sea from 1986 to 2000. We quantified the explanatory power of variables such as depth, location, light, water temperature and fish density for (i) diurnal variation and (ii) haul-to-haul variation in length-stratified bottom trawl catches of cod and haddock. The largest diurnal effects were found for small fish. with depth being the most important cofactor. On the log-scale, the diurnal amplitude of small cod and haddock increased linearly with depth. It also increased with the density of large cod. which was the most important biological factor. The density of fish of the same species and similar length was the most important explanatory variable for haul-to-haul variation. Water temperature was the most important physical factor for all length groups of both cod and haddock. The explanatory variables explained more for haddock than for cod for both haul-to-haul and diurnal variation.;"Inst Marine Res, N-5817 Bergen, Norway; Univ Bergen, Dept Math, N-5008 Bergen, Norway";;Hjellvik, V (corresponding author), Inst Marine Res, POB 1870, N-5817 Bergen, Norway.;vidarh@imr.no;;Godo, Olav Rune/0000-0001-8826-8068;;;31;7;9;0;2;TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS;OSLO;KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY;0036-4827;;SARSIA;Sarsia;Jun/02;2004;89;3;;;;196;210;;10.1080/00364820410006376;;;15;"Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology";830FQ;WOS:000222107500006;;;;;10/01/2022

The experiments were carried out in Izmir Bay in the Eastern Aegean Sea between 4 February 2002 and 22 March 2002. A conventional bottom trawl was operated onboard R/V Egesuf. Selectivity data were collected for red mullet (Mullus barbatus). annular sea bream (Diplodus annularis), picarel (Spicara smaris) and common pandora (Pagellus erythrinus) by using hooped covered codend method. Selectivity parameters were obtained by using logistic equation with the maximum likelihood method and by taking into account between-haul variation. Three codends were tested in a total of 25 hauls of which 18 were accepted valid for picarel and 23 valid for the other three species. In general. the PA material codends produced much higher L-50 values than the PE codend. However, the SRs of the three tested codends, were very close to each other. L-50'S of 40 mm PE, 36 mm PA and 44 mm PA codends, respectively, were found as 8.8. 8.4 and 10.3 cm for annular sea bream; 10.8, 12.4 and 13.8 cm for common pandora. There were not enough red mullet and picarel retained in the 44 min PA codend to estimate the selectivity parameters. Due to insufficient amount of retained fish selection parameters of 44 mm PA codend could not be obtained for red mullet and picarel. L-50'S of PE 40 mm and PA 36 rum codends. respectively, were 10.7 and 12.8 cm for red mullet and 12.4 and 13.3 cm for picarel. It is thought that 40 mm PE netting. which is commercially used, has rather poor selectivity. On the other hand, 44 mm PA codend causes the loss of marketable fish. Amongst the three tested codends 36 mm PA provides the most appropriate selection. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Changes in the fleet's fishing power are differentiated from variations in population abundance through the use of an abundance index estimated from the CPUE of an index vessel catching the species as by-catch. Observed inter-vessel differences in efficiency are then explained by vessel characteristics such as gear used, engine power, length of headline and ground rope, availability of GPS and skipper skills. The application of the method to the French bottom-trawlers targeting anglerfish in the Bay of Biscay and in the Celtic Sea during the period 1983-1998 reveals that fishing gear (twin or simple trawls) and engine power are the most important variables for explaining differences in fishing power.

The rate and magnitude of scavenger and predator aggregation was assessed using three different types of bait, undamaged, lightly damaged and highly damaged individuals of the great scallop Pecten maximus. In each treatment scallops were agitated for 40 minutes in seawater to simulate the dredging process, then subjected to the appropriate damage level before being tethered loosely in front of the video camera. The density of predators and scavengers at undamaged scallops was low and equivalent to recorded periods with no bait. Aggregation of a range of predators and scavengers Occurred at damaged bait. During the 24 hour period following baiting there was a trend of increasing magnitude of predator abundance with increasing damage level. However, badly damaged scallops were eaten quickly and lightly damaged scallops attracted a higher overall magnitude of predator abundance over a longer 4 day period. Large scale temporal variability in predator aggregation to simulated discarded biota was examined by comparison of results with those of a previous study, at the same site, 4 years previously. The community of predators and scavengers present at the bait was substantially different during the 2 studies. These changes in scavenger community were only partially related to changes in the mean background density of scavenging species. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Catch per unit effort (CPUE) data (kg/fishing day/boat) of deep water rose shrimp, Parapenaeus longirostris, Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus, and red shrimps, Aristaemorpha foliacea and Aristeus antennatus, were collected monthly in the years 1991-1999 at the auction of Porto Santo Stefano, where these species are traditionally exploited by trawlers using traditional trawl nets. The application of cluster analysis to the entire data set allowed the identification of three main metiers or fishing tactics, corresponding to different fishing grounds, species assemblages and characteristics of vessels. Two metiers corresponded to fishing activity targeting the above-mentioned crustacean species. Generalised linear modelling was used to investigate the influence of factors such as month, year and vessel on catch rates of the species studied. This model explained a considerable amount of variability in the CPUE data. which substantially reflected the differences observed in the trends of monthly landings of these species. Month was an important factor explaining deviance in the CPUE for the deep water rose shrimp, but especially for the two red shrimps. This was mostly due to the temporal pattern in the catchability of these species, as well as the seasonality of the fishing effort targeting these resources. Year significantly contributed to the variation in CPUE of all the species studied, in particular for P. longirostris, confirming that the abundance of this species is subject to distinctive inter-annual fluctuations. Vessel was a significant factor determining variability in CPUE for P. longirostris and, especially, in N. norvegicus. No single boat characteristic such as length, gross registered tonnage and engine power provided a more satisfactory explanation than the vessel factor as a whole. For Norway lobster, the high variation explained by the vessel is attributable to the fact that the fishing fleet targeting this species was the most heterogeneous, involving two different metiers and, therefore, boats differing in size and in fishing practices.

Commercial-sized clains were collected using high water pressure and mechanical sorting (HP), as in professional fishing, and low water pressure without sorting (LP). To highlight the effects of acute stress due to the different approaches in harvesting clams, various biological responses were evaluated at both organism and cell level. Filtration and respiration rates showed opposite behaviour, the former significantly decreasing, the latter increasing, when mechanical stress was higher. Consequently, lower values of scope for growth in HP clams were observed. The survival in air test exhibited significantly lower median survival time values (LT50) in more severely stressed animals. The haematocrit value and phagocytic index significantly decreased in HP samples, revealing a detrimental effect on mechanisms of immunological defence. Acid phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase activity was also affected by increasing mechanical stress, even though an opposite trend was shown in the two investigated enzymes. Lastly, higher damage levels were detected in shells of HP clams.;"Univ Padua, Dipartimento Biol, I-30121 Padua, Italy; CNR, Ist Sci Marine, I-30122 Venice, Italy";;Marin, MG (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dipartimento Biol, Via Colombo 3, I-30121 Padua, Italy.;mgmar@civ.bio.unipd.it;Ballarin, Loriano/D-7106-2011;"Ballarin, Loriano/0000-0002-3287-8550; MARIN, MARIA/0000-0002-1479-5428; Nesto, Nicoletta/0000-0002-1887-3462";;;10;2;2;0;8;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;NEW YORK;32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA;0025-3154;1469-7769;J MAR BIOL ASSOC UK;J.

To simulate lost nets, 27 fleets of tangle nets were deployed on soft bottoms in the Cantabrian Sea shelf at depths between 117 and 135 m. Nets were recovered at intervals of 1-12 months and their catches recorded (composition, abundance, size, biomass, preservation state) in two trials, measuring seasonal changes in catch rates. A fleet of tangle nets was operated following commercial procedures next to the abandoned nets, providing simultaneous estimates of commercial catch rates. Monkfish (Lophius budegassa and Lophius piscatorius) dominated the fish catches in abandoned tangle nets (81%). In summer-fall conditions, abandoned nets showed after 135 days catch rates similar to those simultaneously recorded for commercial nets (respectively, 0.18 and 0.22 specimens per 100m of netting), but ceased to capture monkfish after 224 days. In spring-summer conditions, monkfish catches were negligible in abandoned experimental nets and lower in the commercial nets than in the previous trial. The pattern of extended catch rates observed in tangle nets abandoned in deep water differed from studies using abandoned gill and trammel nets in shallow waters, which typically cease to capture fish much sooner. Total monkfish catches by abandoned tangle nets were estimated through a cumulative catch model to be 17.7 kg (4.7 specimens) per 100 m of netting. Multiplying this value by the estimated number of tangle nets lost annually by the Cantabrian Sea fishing fleet, it was estimated that 18.1 t of monkfish are captured annually by abandoned nets. This represents 1.46% of the commercial landings of these species in the Cantabrian Sea. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

A biomarker approach was adopted and two physiological indices were applied: adenylate energy charge (AEC) (biochemical level) and reburrowing behaviour (organism level). The aim was to investigate the biological response to various types of fishing, i.e., commercial systems using water at high pressures (HP), and experimental systems at lower pressures (LP) in the field, and to evaluate the response of clams to mechanical stress in the laboratory. Field results showed that HP-treated clams exhibited significantly lower levels of AEC compared with LP treatments. A similar trend was shown by reburrowing behaviour; HP-treated clams reburrowed less. Laboratory results were less clear: a very low level of AEC was measured in both control and treated clams. These poor conditions in foot muscle did not indicate worsening at organism level, as no dead or dying clams were recorded throughout the experiment. However, repeated mechanical stress reduced the percentage of reburrowing clams, which suggested that harvesting may affect reburrowing behaviour. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Cuttlefish have a clear general annual migration pattern, consistently occurring in broadly the same areas in different years. The strength of the Atlantic currents into the west part of the English Channel and the south part of the Celtic Sea may be the dominant influence on the timing of cuttlefish migration to these areas. Local abundance shows a positive correlation with SST, although it is difficult to determine if this reflects any causal link. Cuttlefish expand their distribution further north in the spawning season in warm years and shift south in cool years. The centre of high abundance in offshore deep water shifts north in warm winters and south in cool winters. (C) 2003 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Data were collected during a 2-y period (1998-1999) of quasi-synoptic seasonal sampling using demersal trawl surveys in the Aegean Sea. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to test the hypotheses that there was size-related variation in species' habitat associations and that the study area might serve as a nursery ground for black anglerfish. The current results supported these hypotheses. Data are presented that reveal size-dependent aggregation patterns of black anglerfish and an important habitat utilization of the north-eastern Aegean area. The modelled anglerfish abundances showed a strongly non-linear dependence on the explanatory covariates. The different size-classes exhibited significant seasonal effects and preferences for specific regions and distinct water depths. The present results also suggested that 1-y-old fish and potential spawners appeared to concentrate in the vicinity of the same areas. Two main areas of juvenile aggregations were detected in the deeper water regions of the study area on a seabed of around 300 in depth; both emerged in the proximity of the locations of larger fish. The bathymetric distribution of intermediate size anglerfish followed an inverse trend, with fish captured mainly in shallower waters. Results indicated a preferential aggregation of 1-y-old L. budegassa in the study area that is hypothesized to influence the supply of recruits to distant regions of the Aegean Sea.";"Univ Thessaly, Dept Agr Anim Prod & Aquat Environm, Magnesia 38446, Greece; Natl Ctr Marine Res, GR-16604 Athens, Greece";;Maravelias, C (corresponding author), Univ Thessaly, Dept Agr Anim Prod & Aquat Environm, Fitoko St, Magnesia 38446, Greece.;;Maravelias, Christos/W-4151-2019;Maravelias, Christos/0000-0002-2440-3707;;;21;29;31;0;11;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;NEW YORK;40 WEST 20TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211 USA;0025-3154;;J MAR BIOL ASSOC UK;J.

Large-meshed top panels were designed for the tickler chain type of beam trawls used in this fishery. The design process involved model studies in a flume tank, feasibility trials at sea on a research vessel, and comparative fishing trials on chartered commercial fishing vessels. A total of 11 weeks with 450 hauls in total were fished on two categories of vessels, namely 300 and 1500-2000 hp, representing the major groups in the Dutch fleet. An economic evaluation was also carried out with the landings data from the fish auction. A reduction of 30-40% for cod and whiting could be obtained with the new gear design, with virtually no losses in flatfish (particularly sole and plaice). The results were communicated extensively with representatives of the fishing industry throughout the project. The new gears were found to be effective and acceptable for the fishing industry. Their implementation would help reducing fishing mortality of these species. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this analysis, we investigated variation of catch rates within daytime hours. We used fine scale information from the summer 1999 German small-scale bottom trawl surveys (GSBTSs) in 10 small areas evenly spaced in the North Sea. The analysis was performed for cod ages 0-4+ using generalised linear models, where catch rates are modelled as a function of time of day together with environmental covariates. Results show significant variation of catch rates within daytime. Catch rates in shallow areas, where the water column was not stratified, were relatively low in the early morning, increased to a peak at around 14.00 h and returned to low levels thereafter. Except for age 0 fish, rates in deep stratified areas decreased during day hours. To help interpretation of the patterns, analysis of data from hauls conducted around the clock during 1996 GSBTS in stratified areas were performed. Results indicated diurnal fluctuation with a peak at around 8.00 h and low night rates. Abundance indicators can be affected if surveys are not randomised with respect to time of day. This can be corrected with modelling if relevant information is collected. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Scallops, which evaded dredge capture by swimming up into the water column, were captured by a specially designed net deployed above the dredge gear. The gear was used over a 20-month period and the number and size distribution of queen scallops captured in both the net and dredges were recorded. A subsample of captured scallops was maintained in running seawater tanks and used to assess two components of swimming behaviour, the time taken to respond to stimuli and the number of valve adductions carried out until exhaustion. There was considerable seasonal variability in the proportion of queen scallops that avoided dredge capture by swimming. Very low numbers of queen scallops were found in the net during the winter and spring. Net capture increased in June, and was high throughout the summer and autumn when up to 42% of scallops greater than 55 mm in height, captured in dredges, swam over the dredge mouths. There was a strong positive correlation between seawater temperature and proportion of captured scallops found in the net. Swimming experiments in the laboratory indicated that the observed seasonal variability in net capture was probably a result of changes in the time taken to respond to stimuli, rather than changes in the ability to perform a large number of valve adductions. There was no relationship between reproductive state and the proportion of actively swimming scallops. Analyses of size distributions indicated limited swimming activity in the largest scallops but no effect of epifaunal load was found on the ability of scallops to avoid dredge capture.

The target razor clams Ensis spp. were caught in low numbers, which reflected the low abundance of this genus within the maerl habitat. The hydraulic dredge removed, dispersed and buried the fluorescent maerl at a rate of 5.2 kg m(-2) and suspended a large cloud of sediment into the water column, which settled out and blanketed the seabed to a distance of at least 8 m either side of the dredge track. The likely ecological consequences of hydraulic dredging on maerl grounds are discussed, and a case is made for protecting all maerl grounds from hydraulic dredging and establishing them as reservoirs to allow for the recruitment of commercial bivalve populations at adjacent fished sites.

Various levels of stress were applied, the highest being that used by commercial fishing vessels, which employ high water pressure and mechanised sorting and the lowest manual sampling of clams by scuba divers. Water pressure and sorting significantly increased shell damage, the highest levels always being observed in commercially dredged clams. At Lido, damage was mostly due to the action of the mechanised sorter; at Jesolo, the effect of high water pressure was more clearcut. Moreover, clams collected at Jesolo had both higher mean damage level and higher numbers of damaged individuals compared to the Lido samples. These differences seem to be mostly related to differing bottom features in the two sites. A positive relationship was observed between damage level and clam size: small-sized samples (length <17 mm) were less damaged than medium-sized ones (25 mm < length < 17 mm) and commercial size clams (<25 mm) showed the highest damage level. The severe and harmful physical impact of hydraulic dredging was apparent in captured and then discarded animals, a small fraction of which appears able to recover, as shown by the presence of clams with repaired shells.

Fishing with demersal gears was banned in 1995, but the Gulf was reopened in 1998 only for scallop dredging using the lagamna gear. Two series of samplings were done with this gear in 1998 and 1999 (October) before the beginning of scallop-fishing period (from November up to March), aiming to investigate possible changes in sponge assemblages. Sponges (Porifera) were the most abundant meso-megafaunal benthic organisms in the Gulf, besides scallops and other bivalves. Total abundance, number of species, species diversity, species richness and evenness of sponge assemblages reduced significantly from the year 1998 to 1999. The population of the excavating Cliona celata, the only infaunal sponge species found in the Gulf decreased. Multivariate analysis on the abundance data of epibenthic sponge species revealed a clear separation of samples collected during the 2 years, indicating changes in the structure of sponge assemblages. The distinguishing species included a variety of growth forms: massive (Mycale massa, Suberites domuncula and Tethya citrina), lobose (Suberites massa, Tedania anhelans and Halichondria panicea), erect branching (Raspailia viminalis), encrusting (Crambe crambe) and cushion-shaped (Mycale contarenii and Chondrilla nuculla) sponges. Among these species, only S. massa increased its abundance in 1999. All others decreased. No significant loss of information occurred when multivariate analysis was applied to abundance data of genera or families. This comparative study demonstrated that the time interval between two consecutive scallop-fishing periods was insufficient for the recovery of sponge assemblages. It is concluded that scallop dredging causes long-term changes in the structure and biodiversity of sponge assemblages in the Gulf of Kalloni. An improved strategy of fishery management is required in future for the conservation of living resources in this Gulf. (C) 2003 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

To examine the effect of shrimp trawling on benthic sedimentary habitats a replicated Before/After (B/A) experiment was performed in the Gullmarfjord, Western Sweden, after 6 years protection against trawling activities. The experimental area was randomly divided into three control transects and three trawling transects each similar to 1.5 km long. The experimental fishery activity was designed to mimic the extent and the trawling procedure used before the banning with 80 hauls per site and year. All transects were sampled three times in 1996 before the experimental trawling activity was started, and three times during the experimental trawling activity in the autumn of 1997. Along each transect, 10 replicated sediment profile images (SPIs) were taken randomly at each sampling. The status of the sedimentary habitat was assessed by the parameterisation of a benthic habitat quality (BHQ) index combining sediment surface and subsurface variables and the redox conditions observed in the SPIs. A significant interaction between B/A and treatment was observed in mean BHQ-index. Changes of the BHQ-indices were larger in trawled areas than the natural variation in the experimental area. Mean BHQ-indices in trawled transects were lower than in control transects after the experimental trawling activity was started. In about 43% of the SPIs a severe mechanical disturbance was observed, which introduced a significantly increased spatial variance of BHQ-indices in trawled areas compared to control areas.

This technique allows the imaging of the topmost sediment layers in profile, including the sediment-water interface. Two areas in the Aegean Sea were investigated in time series, each with control and impact areas: a commercial fishing lane with soft sediments at approximately 200 in depth and an experimentally trawled lane with harder maerly sediments at approximately 80 in depth. In total, 158 images were taken at the deep ground and 124 at the shallow ground. A number of measurements were taken from each image, leading to estimates of comparative penetration and small-scale seabed surface roughness. In addition, a large number of surface and subsurface attributes were noted in the images to form the basis of a multivariate analysis. Results indicated that penetration and roughness by themselves were not very good indicators, although roughness was a better indicator particularly in coarse sediments. The major reason for this is that the measurements alone (in particular roughness) do not distinguish between biological and anthropogenic disturbance. The multivariate analysis combining the measurements with the attributes was a good indicator in investigating trawling impacts in coarse sediments, where the lack of good penetration can be compensated by the view over the sediment surface, where more attribute-type data can be gathered. The SPI sampling window gives a relatively small imaged sample in comparison to other imaging techniques (side scan sonar, video, etc.) and in a heterogeneous environment, the more the replicates, the more reliable the method will be. A tiered imaging approach is. recommended where more than one methodology is used.

The experiments were carried out in the Bay of Izmir in the Eastern Aegean Sea between 16 January and 14 February 2002. The experiments were conducted onboard the RN Egesuf (27 in loa, 500 hp main engine) by employing a conventional bottom trawl commercially used in Turkish waters. The hooped covered codend method was used to obtain selectivity data. Eleven valid hauls (45 min towing duration and 2.5 knot average towing speed, 25 to 30 to water depth) were carried out both with C and CP Data were collected for red mullet (Mullus barbatus), annular sea bream (Diplodus annularis), picarel (Spicara smaris), and common pandora (Pagellus erythrinus). Selectivity parameters were obtained by using a logistic equation with the Maximum Likelihood Method. Selectivity of C and CP was found to be very similar for the species investigated except that the 50% retention length (L-50) of CP was 9% higher than that of C for common pandora, and the selection range (SR) of CP was 32% wider than that of C for picarel. L-50 values obtained for C and CP were 10.7 and 10.6 cm for red mullet, 8.6 and 8.6 cm for annular sea bream, 12.3 and 12.1 cm for picarel, and 10.3 and 11.2 cm for common pandora, respectively. These results show that the protective bags used in Turkish demersal trawling do not have a significant effect on codend selectivity for the species investigated.

This was believed to be a result of the absence of deep-water scavengers from the adjacent Atlantic due to dispersal barriers and elevated temperatures at depth. The diversity of bait-attending fauna declined with increasing depth.

As the stock sizes of cod, whiting and saithe have decreased significantly over the period, this offers a unique opportunity to test whether the expected decrease in natural mortality of Norway pout can be detected in mortality estimates obtained directly from abundance data. Two surveys, that cover the Norway pout distribution well, have been analyzed and both showed a clear decrease in total mortality consistent with the decline in predator populations. The estimated average predation mortality is similar to that obtained from Multispecies Virtual Population Analysis (MSVPA), but MSVPA does not reflect the variation in mortality over time. It is speculated that this might be a consequence of the model ignoring a potentially high mortality of age 2 and older fish caused by spawning or growth stress.

The resultant mortality of benthic fauna is strongly size dependent. We empirically. demonstrate that beam trawling frequency in the central North Sea had a greater effect on fauna size distribution in a soft sediment benthic community than variables such as sediment particle size and water depth. Accordingly, we simulated the impacts of trawling disturbance on benthos using a model consisting of 37 organism size classes between 1 mug and 140 g wet weight. The model produced a production-biomass versus size relationship consistent with published studies and allowed us to predict the impacts of trawling frequency on benthos size distributions. Outputs were consistent with empirical data; however, at high yet realistic trawling frequencies, the model predicted an extirpation of most macrofauna. Empirical data show that macrofauna persist in many heavily trawled regions; therefore, we suggest that trawling by real fisheries is sufficiently heterogeneous to provide spatial refuges less impacted by trawling.

Meiofauna may be impacted directly or indirectly by this disturbance, since the passage of trawls causes immediate mortality or displacement, changes sediment structure and geochemistry and affects the abundance of predators or competitors. Since meiofauna make a significantly greater contribution to benthic production than the larger macrofauna, there are compelling reasons to assess their response to chronic trawling disturbance. In this study, we determined the effects of trawling disturbance, season, sediment type and depth on the structure and diversity of nematode communities. Our analyses were based on comparisons between nematode communities in three beam-trawl fishing areas in the central North Sea. These areas were trawled with mean frequencies of I (low disturbance), 4 (medium) and 6 (high) times year 1 respectively. Our analyses showed that trawling had a significant impact on the composition of nematode assemblages. In two sampling seasons, the number of species, diversity and species richness of the community were significantly lower in the area subject to high levels of trawling disturbance than in the areas subject to low or medium levels of disturbance. However, levels of disturbance at the 'low' and 'medium' sites may have been insufficient to cause marked long-term changes in community structure. Many of the observed changes were consistent with responses to other forms of physical disturbance. The extent to which the observed changes in community structure reflect changes in the production of the nematode community remains unknown, although overall abundance was not significantly affected by trawling disturbance.;Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Lowestoft Lab, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England;;Schratzberger, M (corresponding author), Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Lowestoft Lab, Pakefield Rd, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England.;M.Schratzberger@cefas.co.uk;Jennings, Simon/F-5085-2012;"Jennings, Simon/0000-0002-2390-7225; Schratzberger, Michaela/0000-0002-4973-6698";;;44;48;52;0;12;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;0025-3162;1432-1793;MAR BIOL;Mar.

Four sizes of MUSTAD brand, round bent, flatted sea hooks (Quality 2316 DT, numbers 15, 13, 12 and 11) and four mesh sizes of 22, 24, 26 and 28 turn nominal bar length monofilament gill nets were used. Significant differences in the catch size frequency distributions of the two gears were found for four out of five of the most important species caught by both the gears (Diplodus annularis, Diplodus vulgaris, Pagellus erythrinus, Scorpaena porcus and Serranus cabrilla), with longlines catching larger fish and a wider size range than gill nets. Whereas longline catch size frequency distributions for most species for the different hook sizes were generally highly overlapped, suggesting little or no differences in size selectivity, gill net catch size frequency distributions clearly showed size selection, with larger mesh sizes catching larger fish. A variety of models were fitted to the gill net data, with the lognormal providing the best fit in most cases. A maximum likelihood method was also used to estimate the parameters of the logistic model for the longline data. Because of the highly overlapped longline catch size frequency distributions parameters could only be estimated for two species. This study shows that the two static gears have different impacts in terms of size selection. This information will be useful for the more effective management of these small-scale, multi-species and multi-gear fisheries. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Human exploitation of these resources also varies as a function of space, time and the type of fishing activities performed. These three factors determine fishing strategy at different levels of integration. The purpose of this study was to describe and analyse, with respect to different time scales, the relations between the modalities of resource exploitation and the biological or demographic characteristics of the species involved. These investigations relate to the more general task of acquiring the basic knowledge needed for spatialised management of fishing effort. A fleet of trawlers from La Rochelle, operating in the Bay of Biscay, was studied over a 15-year period (1979-1993), which led to the development of a reference resource exploitation scheme for these vessels. The degree of stability of this scheme over time was determined from landing profiles of the 18 most important species fished (94% of landings). An annual cycle for the species composition of landings was determined by multiple factor analysis. Two factors account for more than 55% of the inertia of the data. The first, of biological origin, is closely related to the breeding activity of species and associated migrations between the coast and the open sea. The second is spatial in nature, corresponding to the distribution and availability of resources according to a bathymetric gradient. This organisational scheme persisted over the first 13 years, but showed signs of change toward the end of the study period. Analysis of multi-year trends indicated four periods marked by sustained levels of landings per unit of effort for some species (decreasing for sole and wedge sole, or increasing for Norway lobster, striped red mullet, rays and the smallspotted catshark). These changes are attributable to restrictions on resource access imposed on the fleet (regulations and/or competition among the fishing gears for occupation of space), variations in the abundance of traditionally fished populations (hake, anglerfish) and changes in the professional behaviour of fishermen.

Use of escape windows is permitted in the legislation to give means of improving the size selectivity of cod as an alternative to a traditional standard codend. The history of the use of escape windows in the Baltic Sea cod fishery is reviewed. The present escape windows do not function optimally. The objective of this new experiment was to compare an improved design of escape window, which is placed in the upper panel, with that of standard codend. Three standard codends, with 105, 120 and 140 mm nominal mesh size, and three window codends, with 110, 125 and 135 mm window nominal mesh size, were tested during sea trials conducted in June and July from a commercial trawler using a twin trawl rig and the covered codend technique. A fixed and random effects model of the codend selectivity was formulated to analyse the results and determine the effects of codend type, mesh size and other recorded variables. L50 and SR increased significantly with the mesh size. L50 was significantly increased and SR significantly reduced for a window codend with the same window mesh size (WMS) as that of a standard codend. The L50 of the standard codends decreased with catch weight. An unexplained port-starboard effect was found for the window codends where the L50 depended on which of the two trawls the codend was attached to. The potential of these escape windows as a management tool to improve the size selectivity in the Baltic cod fishery is discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abundance and biomass indices (in terms of number and kg per km(2)) are presented in 15 geographical sectors and 40 subareas from the Alboran Sea to the Aegean Sea. A statistical analysis by generalized linear modelling performed on such indices per main national blocks (Greece, France, Italy and Spain), and considering the effects of the six years of sampling and the depth, showed that biomass increased from west to cast, while for all areas the most significant depth effect appeared between 100 and 200 in, corresponding to the depth range that hosts most of the summer nursery areas. The overall size-frequency distributions in shelf and slope waters, average sizes and total mortality coefficient Z per sector showed that the bulk of the MEDITS samples consisted of young individuals and, with only a few exceptions (western Sardinia, central Aegean), a generalized condition of growth overfishing was apparent. However, no negative trend was found, either in biomass or in average size of fishes, during the six years of the present study. Recruitment patterns were studied by distinguishing the youngest fish as Gaussian groups (modal length from 6 to 9 cm total length) in length-frequency distributions of each subarea and main stratum (shelf and slope). Considering the timing of MEDITS surveys (May-July), this approach emphasised the nurseries in the northern part of the western Mediterranean (Gulf of Lions, Ligurian Sea, northern Tyrrhenian Sea) and in the northern central Mediterranean, where recruitment occurs mainly during spring. On the other hand, few recruits were found in part of the central and particularly in the eastern Mediterranean, where recruitment occurs mainly in summer. MEDITS recruitment patterns therefore gave support to distinctions among Mediterranean hake populations, previously suggested on the basis of vertebral counts and other morpho-physiological, albeit fragmentary, data. In particular the central Mediterranean hake populations do not seem to be homogeneous, with an Adriatic unit very close to the northwestern one. The MEDITS experience therefore suggests that future management measures could take into account both general and regional patterns, the latter concerning mainly the younger fraction of the populations.;"Univ Genoa, Lab Biol Marina Ecol Anim, Dipartimento Studio Territorio & Risorse, I-16126 Genoa, Italy; Natl Ctr Marine Res, Inst Marine Biol Resources, GR-16604 Athens, Greece; Inst Za Oceanografiju & Ribarstvo, Split 21000, Croatia; IFREMER, Stn Sete, Direct Ressources Vivantes, Lab Dinam Syst Prod, F-34203 Sete, France; Ctr Oceanog Malaga, Inst Espanol Oceanog, Fuengirola 29640, Spain; Univ Bologna, Lab Biol Marina & Pesca, I-61032 Fano, PS, Italy";;Relini, LO (corresponding author), Univ Genoa, Lab Biol Marina Ecol Anim, Dipartimento Studio Territorio & Risorse, Via Balbi 5, I-16126 Genoa, Italy.;;"de Sola, Luis Gil/ABE-6143-2020; de Sola Simarro, Luis Gil/F-6281-2019";"de Sola, Luis Gil/0000-0003-1987-9716; de Sola Simarro, Luis Gil/0000-0003-1987-9716; Kavadas, Stefanos/0000-0003-3473-9084";;;42;37;37;1;9;INST CIENCIAS MAR BARCELONA;BARCELONA;PG MARITIM DE LA BARCELONETA, 37-49, 08003 BARCELONA, SPAIN;0214-8358;;SCI MAR;Sci.

Such standardization should result in a fairly constant distance trawled and area or volume swept. Protocols for the North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey (IBTS) establish hauls of 30 min at a target speed of 4 knots over ground with a standard GOV (Grande Ouverture Verticale) trawl. Primarily to evaluate the effect of departures from the target speed and of trawl Speed through water: a fishing experiment was performed Under IBTS protocol conditions. The experiment consisted of 30 hauls made by RV Walther Herwig III- in a small area in the northern North Sea during 5 days in November 1997. Speed over ground was calculated from the distance between GPS shooting and hauling positions. Current speed and direction were continuously recorded by a current metre set a few metres above the sea bottom in the centre of the area to allow trawl speed through water 10 be calculated. We used generalized additive and linear models to analyse variation in catch rates of Norway pout (Trisopterus esmarki), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), whiting (Merlangius merlangus), dab (Limanda limanda) and grey gurnard (Eutrigla gurnardus) with speed over ground and through water. and also with area and volume swept by the gear, together with time of day to account for diel fluctuations. Catch rates of small haddock and whiting, grey gurnard and dab increased significantly with speed over ground while rates of Norway Pont and large whiting increased with speed through water. We propose that this difference is indicative of the vertical distribution of the fish. Most affected by speed were small haddock and whiting: catches in numbers doubled within the range of 3.9 to 5.2 knot ground speed observed during the experiment. Catches of large haddock were stable. Area swept affected small haddock and whiting and volume swept affected small haddock only. With the exception of large whiting. catch rates of all species and sizes varied with time of day typically within a factor of 2 between clay and night.

Samples were taken on a seasonal basis from dredge captured scallops of a single fishing ground in the north Irish Sea. All samples were taken from individuals under the minimum legal landing size. On one date samples were taken from scallops from three separate grounds with contrasting bottom characteristics. At all dates dredge captured scallops had a significantly reduced level of AEC compared to control scallops. This reduction was greatest in February when glycogen levels in the muscle tissue were shown to be at a minimum. There was little or no variability among fishing grounds in the effect of dredge capture on AEC levels. An additional aim of this study was to determine if scallops that encounter dredges but are not captured Suffer a reduction in AEC levels. Scallops collected from dredge tracks immediately following the passage of dredges showed a significant reduction in AEC compared to control, scallops collected front outside the tracks. However, the reduction in AEC was not as great as in captured scallops.;"Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Aquaculture Dev Ctr, Dept Zool & Anim Ecol, Cork, Ireland; Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Dept Microbiol, Cork, Ireland; Univ Liverpool, Port Erin Marine Lab, Port Erin IM9 6JA, Man, England";;Maguire, JA (corresponding author), Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Aquaculture Dev Ctr, Dept Zool & Anim Ecol, Lee Maltings,Prospect Row, Cork, Ireland.;;Jenkins, Stuart R/D-2032-2010;"Jenkins, Stuart R/0000-0002-2299-6318; Maguire, Julie/0000-0002-4326-8790";;;34;9;9;0;3;NATL SHELLFISHERIES ASSOC;SOUTHAMPTON;C/O DR.

The pots, made of steel 1 x 1 cm square-meshed netting, were 105 cm in length and 3 1 1 in diameter. They were baited using various crushed crustaceans. The pots were placed at depths between 5 and 10 in on rocky bottom with a dense cover of Laminaria spp. and other macroalgae. A professional fisherman conducted the fishing. Sometimes the pots were hauled once a day, and sometimes twice or three times a day. This did not influence the catch rates. The Catch per pot ranked Lip to 390. The mean catch per pot was 25.8, 18.8, 46.9, 42.7, 55.5 for 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively. Distribution of catch per pot was highly skewed to the left for the first 2 years, while the distribution became progressively More symmetrical for the later years. In 1997, 10% of the pots yielded more than 90 fish, and, in 1998, 9% yielded higher catches. For the other years, this figure ranges from 0.1% to 3%. The proportion of pots yielding fewer than 10 fish decreased from nearly 40% in 1995 to 1% in 1998. The catch rates were dependent on temperature.

The data collected by on-board observers from these surveys enabled investigation into the optimal number of hauls, trips and vessels that require sampling to achieve target levels of precision for each gear type and country. Residual maximum likelihood (REML) was used to estimate the variance components between vessels, between trip,; within vessels and between hauls within trips within vessels, while examining the significance of the fixed effects of area, quarter and their interaction. To meet the REML requirement that the data are normally distributed, the extreme skewness of the data was corrected by a natural log transformation. The estimated lognormal variance components were used within the multistage formulae to estimate the optimal average sampling levels at each stage.

Jones were compared with modem samples from seven sites in the Irish Sea. Multivariate and univariate methods were used to compare community change over time and examine the possible impact of scallop dredging over the 60 year time period. A conservative approach to data analysis ensured that observed differences in faunal composition between time periods were not due to differences in sampling methodologies or taxonomic identification. The community composition changed at all sites, though to different degrees. The amount of change was related to how, long a site had been fished, rather than fishing intensity. Mobile, robust and scavenging taxa have increased in abundance, while slow-moving or sessile, fragile taxa have decreased. Differences between historical and modem samples were greater than could be accounted for by the natural variability, of the system (as indicated by spatial and temporal replication at three sites) and indicate real long-term change. This study emphasises that. in the absence of good-quality data series and experiments, the use of 'fuzzy' historical data is often the only possible way to judge long-term change and can yield valuable results.

Three mesh sizes were tested. for each set net: 45, 70 and 90 mm (stretched-mesh size). Selectivity was assessed by the indirect Sechin model based on the measurement of maximum body girth and head girth. The 45-mm mesh size was the most efficient for all the target species irrespective of net type. The catches obtained with the 90-mm. meshes were always very low as were the catches of D. annularis and M. barbatus with the 70-mm mesh. Although most fishes of the three target species were caught by gilling and/or wedging, with all gears a number of individuals were also caught by virtue of the tangled and/or pocket effects. Their proportion, lowest and generally negligible in the gill net, higher in the monofilament and highest in the standard trammel net, caused a progressive, widening of size-catch ranges, confirming the low selectivity of trammel nets. The 45-mm mesh appears to be the most suitable for the exploitation of the target species because it caught the highest number of specimens while it largely spared the juveniles.

The need to reduce discard mortality and increase the yield per recruit in sea bass fisheries prompted an investigation into the effectiveness of escape vents in the traps. An array of experimental traps using one of four escape vents openings (sizes of 2.86 cm x 14.6 cm, 3.18 cm x 14.6 cm, 3.49, cm x 14.6 cm, or 3.81 cm x 14.6 cm) was fished from May to November 1994. Use of escape vents significantly (p < 0.001) reduced catch of black sea bass in traps with the primary impact on sub-legal size fish. The optimal vent size was 2.86 cm x 14.6 em, which produced the highest ratio of legal- to sub-legal-sized sea bass. The catch of legal size sea bass was reduced in number by 3% whereas the catch of sub-legal fish was reduced to 72%. Seasonal changes in catch occurred among all vent sizes, which followed the traditional pattern of highest landings in the fall prior to the fishes migration to the outer continental shelf. The use of escape vents should result in relatively small short-term economic losses to fishermen while increasing the efficiency of fishing practices and increasing long-term yields from the fisheries.

Meiofauna may be resistant to disturbance by trawling because they are likely to be resuspended rather than killed by trawls and because their short generation times would allow them to withstand elevated mortality. We used a BACI experimental approach to investigate the short-term effects of beam trawling on the diversity, biomass and community structure of meiofauna on real fishing grounds in the southern North Sea. Experiments at two locations showed that there were no short- to medium-term (1-392 days after experimental trawling) trawling impacts on meiofaunal diversity or biomass, but that there were mild effects on community structure. Any impacts due to trawling were minor in relation to seasonal changes in the meiofaunal communities. We assessed the power of our experiments to detect the effects of trawling and recorded a 44-85% chance of detecting a 50% change in species richness and a 65% chance of detecting an order-of-magnitude change in biomass. The power to detect changes in total abundance, however, was low (between 11% and 12% power for detecting a change of 50%). We suggest that meiofauna are more resistant to disturbance by beam trawling than are macrofauna and that they have the potential to withstand the effects of chronic trawling on real fishing grounds and to retain a key role in energy cycling.;"Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Burnham Lab, Burnham On Crouch CM0 8HA, Essex, England; Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Lowestoft Lab, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England";;Schratzberger, M (corresponding author), Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Burnham Lab, Remembrance Ave, Burnham On Crouch CM0 8HA, Essex, England.;m.schratzberger@cefas.co.uk;Jennings, Simon/F-5085-2012;"Jennings, Simon/0000-0002-2390-7225; Schratzberger, Michaela/0000-0002-4973-6698";;;66;83;85;0;24;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;0025-3162;1432-1793;MAR BIOL;Mar.

Monthly samples were collected along the estuary in 1996 in order to analyse the seasonal changes of the mesozooplankton community and to identify the major environmental parameters that may influence the spatial distribution of zooplankton in this megatidal estuary. Statistical analysis (canonical correspondence analysis) showed that salinity was the main factor correlated with the longitudinal distribution of zooplankton. Marine species (Temora longicornis, barnacle larvae...) were located in the outer part of the estuary, while more oligohaline species (Eurytemora affinis) were recorded in the inner part of the estuary. A mixed zone was characterised by the presence of the neritic copepods Acartia spp. and Eurytemora affinis. The marine species (e.g. T longicornis, Oikopleura dioica, Barnacle larvae) showed maximum abundance at the end of spring (June) while the most abundant estuarine species, E. affinis, peaked in late winter-spring and declined with the onset of summer. This copepod dominated the estuarine zooplankton throughout the year, and found in the Seine estuary very high favourable conditions to exhibit ultimate abundances (> 190 000 ind m(-3)) which is one order of magnitude higher than those found in other European estuaries. It represented the main prey for major planktonivorous species such as suprabenthic and fish species located living in the upstream zone of the Seine estuary.

This area was heavily fished for Pecten maximus (Linnaeus, 1758) prior to closure, and the seabed immediately surrounding the closed area is still one of the most heavily dredged in the Irish Sea. Two methods have been used to study the effect of scallop dredging on the benthos in this closed area and adjacent fished areas. Firstly, twice-yearly grab sampling of experimental plots inside and outside the closed area since 1995 has enabled comparisons of the benthic infauna and epifauna of experimentally dredged plots, undredged control plots and plots exposed to commercial dredging. Secondly, divers have carried out visual transect surveys of P. maximus numbers regularly since closure. Communities of experimentally disturbed plots have become less similar to adjacent undisturbed control areas and more similar to commercially dredged areas. At each sampling date, similarity between dredged samples was greater than between undredged samples. Since 1989, there have been increases in the mean numbers of P. maximus in the closed area. The age structure of the closed area P. maximus population is also different to that outside, with a higher mean age due to the presence of large, old individuals. These results present strong evidence that scallop dredging alters benthic communities and suggest that the closure of areas to commercial dredging may allow the development of more heterogeneous communities and permit the populations of some species to increase. A common problem with studying fishing disturbance is the lack of good control sites and this work also demonstrates the value of closed areas to scientific studies of demersal fishing.;Univ Liverpool, Port Erin Marine Lab, Port Erin IM9 6JA, Man, England;;Bradshaw, C (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Port Erin Marine Lab, Port Erin IM9 6JA, Man, England.;;Bradshaw, Clare/I-1833-2013;Bradshaw, Clare/0000-0002-8421-2750;;;47;49;49;0;31;KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0018-8158;;HYDROBIOLOGIA;Hydrobiologia;DEC;2001;465;01/Mar;;;;129;138;;10.1023/A:1014573731609;;;10;Marine & Freshwater Biology;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Marine & Freshwater Biology;530JF;WOS:000174354000013;;;;;10/01/2022

Comparative fishing surveys indicate a significantly different selectivity of the vibrating dredge, with respect to a standard gear: in fact, undersize clams are sieved out during the fishing process, and almost no juveniles are hauled. Regarding the product quality, laboratory analyses show that the amount of intervalvar sediment is significantly lower in the catch from the modified dredge, due to a sort of 'warning' device. Nevertheless, the larger number of damaged shells suggests that the vibrating grid subjects the clams to a greater mechanical stress than the standard gear. As for the environmental effects, the vibrating bottom is selective for the associated fauna too, as is shown by the higher mean weight of most the by-catch species in the experimental gear. Moreover, the riddling goes on continuously, allowing the immediate release of the sorted-out organisms, which are repositioned in the area of origin, thus avoiding a 'contagious' distribution. In conclusion, these positive preliminary results suggest real benefits of this innovative modified dredge, with wide margins for further improvement.;"Consorzio Mediterraneo Scrl, I-00184 Rome, Italy; Soc Porto Romano SpA, I-00100 Rome, Italy; CNR, I-00100 Rome, Italy";;Rambaldi, E (corresponding author), Consorzio Mediterraneo Scrl, Via Nazl 243, I-00184 Rome, Italy.;;Bianchini, Marco L./B-3635-2008;Bianchini, Marco L./0000-0001-9821-2236;;;8;2;4;1;8;KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0018-8158;;HYDROBIOLOGIA;Hydrobiologia;DEC;2001;465;01/Mar;;;;169;173;;10.1023/A:1014540824340;;;5;Marine & Freshwater Biology;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Marine & Freshwater Biology;530JF;WOS:000174354000016;;;;;10/01/2022

Catch and effort data were obtained from a selection of fishers that operated in the Nephrops fishery on a daily basis, and the environmental factors studied were those considered by the fishers themselves to be the ones driving variability in the fishery. Using multivariate regression analysis and MANOVA, depth, atmospheric pressure, cloud cover, and sea state were found to affect the catch rate of the Nephrops deep-water fishery in the northwestern Mediterranean. The results are consistent with the hypothesis already in the scientific literature that the light intensity reaching the seabed has a primary influence on the activity rates of Nephrops and hence the species' vulnerability to trawling. The value of collaborating with fishers in establishing scientific hypotheses and obtaining data, and specifically drawing on their knowledge of the ecosystem in which they operate, is shown by this study, a case study in integrating Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) into fisheries management.

About 44% (range 39-49%) of the total catch was discarded at sea (13500-22000 t annually), the main component of the discards was fish. Hauls were classified into two main clusters using the discard quantities of fish, crustaceans, and cephalopods. The two clusters were discriminated by depth. Two sets of equations that classify new hauls in the clusters, using depths and duration of the hauls or marketable yield, were applied. The discarded yield of fish showed more precise relationships with their marketable yield in each season than did crustaceans and cephalopods. The latter were strongly affected by the specific characteristic of the different areas and clusters. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The main change was the decrease of elasmobranchs diversity and frequency, mostly referring to the Hypotremata group. Life history parameters appeared to be determining factors, since small sized species such as the smallspotted catshark (S. canicula) or the brown ray (R. miraletus) were frequently collected in both surveys, while bigger shark species and most other rays disappeared or were rarely found during the 1998 survey. Regarding bony fishes, common species were collected with similar frequency in both surveys; some fishery target species (e.g. the hake) have similar percentage values (biomass) in both surveys, while others (the silver scabbardfish) have increased values, and some (mainly small sized species such as red mullet) replace elasmobranchs at the top of the catches.

This is due to either the origin of the fish sampled, e.g. from areas with a relatively low cephalopod abundance, or to the method of prey identification: cephalopods are rarely identified to species. This paper presents a summary of recent sampling of the cephalopod species appearing in the diet of commercially important fish species in UK waters. Samples of demersal fish from around Scotland and from the English Channel were collected opportunistically during: research trawl surveys and from commercial trawlers in different seasons. For all fish species examined, incidence of cephalopods in the stomachs was low, with fish and crustacean prey dominating stomach contents. Most of the cephalopods found were species with little or no commercial value and small adult body size, such as the small loliginid squid Alloteuthis spp. and bobtail squid (Sepiolidae). Only during December 1998 were some commercially valuable squid (Loligo spp.) observed in fish stomachs, although in relatively small quantities and comprising mainly of pre recruit individuals. It is reasonable to suggest that most commercially fished teleosts have little direct impact on post-recruits of commercially important cephalopod stocks, although their impact on recruitment may be significant.

An age-related factor was included to allow for apparently lower catchabilities of young fish. The models fitted satisfactorily. permitting intercalibration factors to be estimated with standard errors. No indications of changes in Z were found over the period or over different year classes for any of the species. Residual errors were positively correlated among-ages-within-years for each survey. Residual degrees of freedom were therefore reduced using an information measure before testing factors in the model for significance or estimating standard errors.

Two size classes of the scallop, Pecten maximus (L. 1758), were examined: below minimum legal landing size (MLLS), (90-109 mm shell length (SL)) and above MLLS (> 109 mm SQ. Estimates of efficiency from the depletion experiment (24.3% and 29.5% respectively) were consistently lower than those from the diver surveys (38.0% and 40.7% respectively). This difference appeared to be due to inherent variation in the efficiency of scallop dredges rather than bias from either technique. This emphasizes the need for error terms to be built into estimates of dredge efficiency. The diver survey also found that dredges were highly selective toward scallops greater than 90 mm SL, catching only 3.0% or less of individuals below this size. Consequently, the diver survey provided a much more accurate assessment of scallop size and age composition than dredge surveys. Dredge efficiency was also assessed for four species of benthic fauna commonly taken as by-catch in the local fishery. Estimates of efficiency from the depletion experiment were found to include a considerable amount of indirect fishing mortality. When efficiency was defined as total mortality due to fishing (the combination of catch and indirect fishing mortality), estimates from the depletion experiment and diver surveys were in close agreement. For two species, Luidia ciliaris (Phillipi 1837) and Cancer pagurus (L. 1758), these efficiency or total mortality estimates were approximately 45% and 68% respectively, emphasizing the impact scallop dredging might have on non-target species. In summary, we recommend that if possible, depletion experiments should be combined with diver surveys when assessing scallop dredge performance. Diver surveys provided additional information on dredge selectivity along with an improved measure of the variance in dredge efficiency estimates.;Univ Liverpool, Port Erin Marine Lab, Port Erin IM9 6JA, Man, England;;Beukers-Stewart, BD (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Port Erin Marine Lab, Port Erin IM9 6JA, Man, England.;brycebs@liverpool.ac.uk;"Jenkins, Stuart R/D-2032-2010; Beukers-Stewart, Bryce D/B-5262-2011";"Jenkins, Stuart R/0000-0002-2299-6318; ";;;27;25;25;0;13;NATL SHELLFISHERIES ASSOC;GROTON;C/O DR.

Trawling disturbance has wide-ranging impacts on the marine environment and is well known to modify benthic habitat and community structure. This has led to speculation about the positive and negative impacts of trawling on ecosystem processes such as production. 2. Existing theory suggests that frequent trawling disturbance may lead to the proliferation of smaller benthic species, with faster life histories, because they can withstand the mortality imposed by trawling and benefit from reduced competition or predation as populations of larger species are depleted. Since smaller species are more productive, trawling disturbance may 'farm the sea', with knock-on benefits for consumers, including fish populations. 3. We conducted the first large-scale studies of trawling effects on benthic production across quantified gradients of trawling disturbance on real fishing grounds in two regions (Silver Pit and Hills) of the North Sea. There were 27- and 10-fold differences in levels of beam trawl disturbance among the Silver Pit and Hills sites, respectively. 4. Size structure was described using normalized size-spectre, and the slopes and intercepts of these spectra were related to levels of trawling disturbance. Production was estimated from the size spectra, using a new allometric relationship between body mass and the production to biomass (P:B) ratio of marine invertebrates. The general validity of the relationship was confirmed using a phylogenetic comparative approach. 5. In the Silver Pit region, trawling led to significant decreases in infaunal biomass and production. The abundance of larger individuals was depleted more than smaller ones, as reflected by the positive relationship between the slope of the normalized size spectra and trawling disturbance. The effects of trawling disturbance were not significant in the epifaunal community. In the Hills region, where the range of trawling disturbance was lower, trawling disturbance did not have significant effects on biomass or production. 6. In the Silver Pit, relative infaunal production (production per unit biomass) rose with increased trawling disturbance. This was attributable largely to the dominance of smaller animals in the disturbed communities. The increase in relative production did not compensate for the loss of total production that resulted from the depletion of large individuals. There was some evidence for the proliferation of small polychaetes at moderate levels of disturbance, but at higher levels of disturbance their biomass and production fell. 7. We conclude that reported increases in the biomass and production of small infaunal invertebrates in the North Sea are attributable largely to recent increases in primary production that were driven by climate change, and not to the effects of trawling disturbance.;"Lowestoft Lab, Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England; Univ Coll Swansea, Sch Biol Sci, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales";;Jennings, S (corresponding author), Lowestoft Lab, Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England.;S.Jennings@cefas.co.uk;Jennings, Simon/F-5085-2012;"Jennings, Simon/0000-0002-2390-7225; Duplisea, Daniel/0000-0002-0844-359X";;;85;187;191;2;81;WILEY-BLACKWELL;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-8790;1365-2656;J ANIM ECOL;J.

In two surveys carried out in fishing grounds in spring and summer 1993, 93 daylight hauls (of 3 hours each) based on the covered codend (cover of 14 mm mesh side) method were carried out. The composition and quantity of the combined, retained and escaped catch for the most relevant species and mixed categories of the different gear configurations (codends + cover) were analyzed and compared by applying both univariate (ANOVA) and multivariate (clustering and multidimensional scaling) techniques. The reduction of by-catch, the economic loss and the economic efficiency were used as indexes of the retention performance of the different codends. The overall catch was 6398 t (23 kg/h); Aristaeomorpha foliacea accounts for most of the catch in number, weight (48% of the total) and value (87% of the total value). Bony fishes, cartilaginous fishes and other crustaceans are the by-catch, representing, respectively, 26%, 16% and 9% of the catch in weight, the rest belonging to cephalopods. The use of the different codends does not influence the overall performance of the gear. No saturation was detected, with the escapement ratio uninfluenced by the amount retained. Considering the retention characteristics, results indicate that the 16 mm and 20 mm mesh codends are not selective, whereas the 24/14 and 28/14 configurations produce increased escaping ability. The 45 mm mesh sieves out 79% of specimens, indicating that no masking effect was induced by the cover. Regarding economic efficiency, the 20/14 configuration provides values comparable to those obtained with the 24/14, whereas the 16/14 configuration is as efficient as the 28/14. The lowest efficiency was obtained using the 45/14 configuration. Multidimensional scaling and clustering techniques (performed on 20, 24 and 28 mm codends) allow to discriminate the escapement ability of the 28/14 gear configuration only. Present results support the introduction of the 28 mm mesh codend in the deep-water red shrimp fisheries in the view of a precautionary management of the resources.";"CNR, IRMA, Ist Ric Risorse Marine & Ambiente, I-91026 Mazara, TP, Italy; Univ Palermo, Ist Istol Embriol, Palermo, Italy; CNR, Rome, Italy; Soc Porto Romano, S Marinella, RM, Italy";;Ragonese, S (corresponding author), CNR, IRMA, Ist Ric Risorse Marine & Ambiente, Via Vaccara 61, I-91026 Mazara, TP, Italy.;;Bianchini, Marco L./B-3635-2008;Bianchini, Marco L./0000-0001-9821-2236;;;40;27;29;0;9;KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL;DORDRECHT;SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0018-8158;;HYDROBIOLOGIA;Hydrobiologia;APR;2001;449;01/Mar;;;;279;291;;10.1023/A:1017564530716;;;13;Marine & Freshwater Biology;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Marine & Freshwater Biology;456AK;WOS:000170059800031;;;;;10/01/2022

The species selected for this study were common dab. herring, haddock and whiting. Differences between day and night were observed for the juvenile common dab and herring and for the adult common dab and haddock. Differences between shallow and deep water were observed for the juveniles of all the species and for the adults of common dab, haddock and whiting. The mean lengths and the composition of the common dab and whiting catches were affected by both light and depth, indicating behaviour differences: between the juveniles and adults of these species. Whilst light seems to have no effect on the mean length and the catch composition of herring. differences were observed between shallow and deep waters. In the case of haddock, neither the light level nor the depth had any noticeable effect on the mean length and catch composition of the catches. We conclude that the diel behaviour and the geographic distribution are important factors in determining the quantity and composition of trawl catches, but their effects are species dependent. When trawl surveys are not tract replicates in terms of fishing times and areas, the estimation of catch indices should allow for the possible bias introduced by these factors. There is a need for models of the capture process that take account of such effects.;"Natl Ctr Marine Res, Athens 16604, Greece; FRS Marine Lab, Aberdeen AB11 9BD, Scotland";;Petrakis, G (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Marine Res, Agios Kosmas Hellinikon, Athens 16604, Greece.;;;;;;55;49;50;0;5;ACADEMIC PRESS LTD;LONDON;24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND;1054-3139;;ICES J MAR SCI;ICES J.

The relative abundances of two highly sought after spearfishing target-fish species, Dicentrarchus labrax (Linnaeus 1758) and Sparus aurata Linnaeus 1758, were compared using underwater visual censuses in shallow (< 5 m) inshore waters along rocky shores inside and outside a marine reserve area in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea (Banyuls-sur-Mer region, France). 2. The relative abundances of these two species were consistently lower outside the reserve area, which comprised around 40% of the 25.6 km of inshore coastal waters surveyed. 3. The demographic structure of D. labrax was also different inside and outside the protected area, the proportion of larger fish being significantly higher in the marine reserve. 4. The direct and indirect impacts of spearfishing are postulated to explain the distributional and population structural characteristics of these two species in the shallow waters off this rocky coast. 5. Prohibition of spearfishing has favoured the persistence of these species during summer (the main spearfishing season) in the shallower inshore waters inside the area of the Cerbere/Banyuls-sur-Mer marine reserve. 6. These preliminary results indicate the need for additional work in this area and further surveys to ascertain spearfishing impacts on target-fish species in the vicinity of other marine protected areas.

Experimental trap fishing in the reserve and at two unprotected sites revealed that cessation of fishing in the reserve is probably responsible for high catch rates observed there and that the annual fishing closure is effective in rebuilding populations in exploited areas. In the reserve, variations in abundance, sex ratio, and size of lobsters were conspicuous. Catch rates were always higher in deep (50-80 m) than in shallow areas (20-50 m). Bathymetric differences in abundance were smallest in early summer, possibly because of seasonal onshore movements associated with reproduction. Females were always more abundant than males and less variable in number and size. Ancillary data suggest that reproductive and moulting behaviour, particularly of males, influences population estimates of P. elephas from trap surveys. Presence of subadults in deeper waters of the reserve suggests that 2- to 3-year-old juveniles undergo ontogenetic migration from the shallow settlement habitats (< 20 m) to deeper habitats (> 50 m). The results highlight the effectiveness of fishing restrictions in rebuilding P. elephas populations and suggest that the lobster population in the reserve is not closed.;Ctr Oceanog Baleares, Palma de Mallorca 07080, Spain;;Goni, R (corresponding author), Ctr Oceanog Baleares, Aptdo 291, Palma de Mallorca 07080, Spain.;raquel.goni@ba.ieo.es;Quetglas, Antoni/K-9089-2014;"Quetglas, Antoni/0000-0002-1303-8003; Renones, Olga/0000-0003-2217-5576";;;50;41;42;0;17;CSIRO PUBLISHING;CLAYTON;UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA;1323-1650;1448-6059;MAR FRESHWATER RES;Mar.

Divers were deployed immediately after dredges had passed, to record levels of damage to megafauna left in the dredge tracks. Mean damage levels, and the proportions of the 4 damage scores in the bycatch and on the seabed, were the same in most species. Some common species did show differences. The edible crab Cancer pagurus was more severely damaged when not captured, while the starfish Asterias rubens and whelk Neptunea antiqua received greater damage within the bycatch. Capture efficiency for the megafauna was low, ranging from 2 to 25 % among species.

We studied the effects of bottom trawling on the trophic structure of infaunal and epifaunal benthic communities in 2 regions (Silver Pit and Hills) of the central North Sea. Within each region, we quantified long-term (over 5 yr) differences in trawling disturbance at a series of sites (using sightings data from fishery protection flights), and related this to differences in the biomass and trophic structure of the benthic community. There were 27- and 10-fold differences in levels of beam trawl disturbance among the Silver Pit and Hills sites respectively, and we estimated that the frequency with which the entire area of the sites was trawled ranged from 0.2 to 6.5 times yr(-1) in the Silver Pit and 0.2 to 2.3 times yr(-1) in the Hills. The impacts of fishing were most pronounced in the Silver Pit region, where the range of trawling disturbance was greater. Infaunal and epifaunal biomass decreased significantly with trawling disturbance. Within the infauna, there were highly significant decreases in the biomass of bivalves and spatangoids (burrowing sea-urchins) but no significant change in polychaetes. Relationships between trophic level (estimated using nitrogen stable isotope composition, delta N-15) and body mass (as log(2) size classes) were rarely significant, implying that the larger individuals in this community did not consistently prey on the smaller ones. For epifauna, the relationships were significant, but the slopes or intercepts of the fitted linear regressions were not significantly related to trawling disturbance. Moreover, mean delta N-15 Of the sampled infaunal and epifaunal communities were remarkably consistent across sites and not significantly related to trawling disturbance. Our results suggest that chronic trawling disturbance led to dramatic reductions in the biomass of infauna and epifauna, but these reductions were not reflected in changes to the mean trophic level of the community, or the relationships between the trophic levels of different sizes of epifauna. The trophic structure of intensively trawled benthic invertebrate communities may be a robust feature of this marine ecosystem, thus ensuring the efficient processing of production within those animals that have sufficiently high intrinsic rates of population increase to withstand the levels of mortality imposed by trawling.;"Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Lowestoft Lab, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England; Univ Newcastle Upon Tyne, Dept Marine Sci & Coastal Management, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England";;Jennings, S (corresponding author), Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Lowestoft Lab, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England.;s.jennings@cefas.co.uk;"Pinnegar, John K/C-4400-2012; Langhamer, Olivia/J-3425-2012; Jennings, Simon/F-5085-2012";"Jennings, Simon/0000-0002-2390-7225; Polunin, Nick/0000-0002-1480-8794; Pinnegar, John/0000-0001-5061-9520";;;70;148;152;2;81;INTER-RESEARCH;OLDENDORF LUHE;NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY;0171-8630;;MAR ECOL PROG SER;Mar.

This paper investigates some aspects of this process, including the relative attractiveness to predators of different discard species, and the role of damage in scavenger attraction. A time-lapse video system with a 1000 m long cable was positioned in an area closed to fishing, adjacent to the most heavily fished scallop (Pecten maximus) ground in the Irish Sea. A variety of undamaged and damaged by-catch animals were positioned in front of the camera, and the subsequent predator aggregations investigated. Densities of scavenger species up to 200 times that of the background population were observed, and aggregations of some species persisted for up to 3 days. The most frequently recorded scavengers, and therefore presumably those species most likely to benefit from discards as a food source, were: Asterias rubens L., Astropecten irregularis (Pennant), Liocarcinus spp Stimpson, Pagurus spp Fabricius and Callionymus lyra L. Predator attraction to apparently undamaged queen scallops, Aequipecten opercularis (L.), was almost as high as to damaged A. opercularis. Of all the prey species studied, queen scallops were the most attractive to scavengers. A directional relationship was found between the ambient water current and the arrival of the starfish, Asterias rubens. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

No quantitative historical benthos data are available for the period prior to commencement of the fishery, although limited qualitative data exist. Therefore, studies of medium to long-term effects involved sampling the fauna of areas around wrecks (i.e., unfished pseudo-control sites) for comparison with fished grounds. Attempts were made to calculate the short, medium, and long-term impact of the fishery on the benthos and surrounding environment. Direct (short-term) effects were not quantifiable at a heavily fished offshore site (75 m depth); however, some changes were visible in a less fished, shallow (35 m depth) site. Medium to long-term effects were more discernible at the offshore site. Only minor changes were observed at the inshore location, suggesting that it is fishing intensity pei se, rather than the direct impact from passage of the gear, that constitutes the major factor controlling long-term negative trends in the benthos of the Irish Sea Nephrops grounds.

The benthos dredge Triple-D was used to sample megafauna (>1 cm), while macrofauna (>1 mm) were sampled by means of a Reineck boxcorer and, in some cases, a van Veen grab. Direct mortalities ranging from about 5 up to 40% of the initial densities were observed for a number of gastropods, starfishes, small and medium-sized crustaceans, and annelid worms. For bivalve species, direct mortalities were found from about 20 up to 65%. Mortality per m(2) trawled area due to fishing with a 12-m beam trawl was not higher than that due to a 4-m beam trawl. For all species considered, the direct mortality was largely attributed to animals that died in the trawl track, either as a direct result of physical damage inflicted by the passage of the trawl or indirectly owing to disturbance, exposure, and subsequent predation. In 1994, the 12 m beam trawl with tickler chains was the dominant gear type in the Dutch sector, resulting in a mean annual trawling Frequency of 1.23. The mean annual trawling frequencies with the 4 m beam trawl using tickler chains, the 4 m beam trawl with a chain mat, and the otter trawl were 0.13, 0.01, and 0.06, respectively. The annual fishing mortality in invertebrate megafaunal populations in the Dutch sector ranged From 5 up to 39%, with half of the species showing values of more than 20%. For all species studied, the 12 m beam-trawl fisheries caused higher annual fishing mortalities than the concerted action of the other fisheries. Only with respect to species restricted to sandy coastal areas did the 4 m beam-trawl fleet contribute substantially to the annual mortality. Implications of the impact of trawling on the composition of benthic communities are discussed.

The effects of using environmental strata, instead of ICES rectangles for density distributions, and of using higher-resolution fishing-effort data on the population mortality estimates of 21 infauna and epifauna species were investigated. Variation in species abundance was markedly smaller based on sediment-depth strata than based on ICES rectangles, and the resulting population mortality estimates differed significantly among species (ratio ranged from 0.3 to 1.6) depending on the overlap of the spatial distribution of a species and of beam-trawl effort. Changing the resolution of fishing effort from ICES rectangles or sediment-depth strata to 1' minute latitude x 2' minute longitude square (+/-1 x 1 nm) resulted in a systematic reduction of population mortality by a factor 0.7 due to the patchy effort distribution. We argue that annual fishing mortality should preferably be based on relevant environmental strata, and accuracy of the estimates increases markedly when the resolution of spatial fishing effort data sufficiently reflects the patchiness of the fleet's activities.

In general, the frequency of occurrence of bivalve species declined, whereas scavenger and predator species (crustaceans, gastropods, and sea stars) were observed more frequently in 1986. We suggest that these shifts can be attributed not only to the physical fishery impact, but also to the additional potential food for scavenging and predator species provided by the large amounts of discards and moribund benthos. Our findings are put into the perspective of the general development of the demersal fishery in the southern North Sea. Despite the problems with the historical data set, the comparison presented may be the best illustration achievable of the changes in the benthos from a near-pristine situation to the present conditions after long-term disturbance.

The importance of these food sources to scavenging benthic species was investigated. To identify epibenthic species showing scavenging behaviour and to detect their food preferences, traps (370 overall) baited with different kinds of carrion (fish, crustaceans, molluscs, echinoderms, polychaetes) were deployed at 14 locations in the southern North Sea. Liocarcinus holsatus, Pagurus bernhardus, Asterias rubens, ophiurids, and small gadoids were the main active scavengers feeding on different kinds of food, while lyssianid amphipods (Orchomene nanus, Scopelocheirus hopei) fed mainly on crustacean carrion. Estimated attraction areas were largest for gadoids, hermit crabs, and swimming crabs. Immigration of fish and swimming crabs into experimentally trawled areas was observed by sampling repeatedly in a trawled strip. Differences in the response to trawling (feeding activity, food niche breadth, and resource partitioning) between selected fish species are described. Limanda limanda, Pleuronectes platessa, Merlangius merlangus, Callionymus lyra, and Eutrigla gurnardus all showed strong responses, using different feeding strategies. In situ clearance rates of dead discarded fish exposed on the sea floor were estimated. Discards as well as moribund benthos were consumed within a few days. The balance between the amount of food materials produced by beam-trawl fishery and the amount of food consumed by potential scavengers was translated in a model of the food hows as mobilized by beam trawling. In general, the direct importance of the additional food resource for populations of scavengers is considered to be relatively small. However, the importance may be relatively larger for scavenging fish than for invertebrates. It is estimated that after a single beam trawling about 1.27 g m(-2) ash-free dry biomass, or 6% to 13% of the annual secondary production of macrobenthos per unit area, would suddenly become available to scavengers and to the detritus food chain. It is suggested that beam trawling leads to shortcuts in trophic relationships and therefore may enhance secondary production.

The codend cover technique was used to determine the codend selectivity, whereas the whole trawl selectivity was estimated using small mesh pockets attached to several positions on the body of the net. Codend selectivity for shrimp proved to be very variable and was significantly influenced by clogging of the meshes, catch volume and state of the sea. The L50 for shrimp, for all hauls combined, was 39.4 mm and the selection factor 1.82 for a mesh size of 21.7 mm. The selection range was 11.6 mm,The selectivity of the net body was quite important and allowed more shrimps to escape than the codend did. It was mainly the rounded lateral part of the belly that contributed to this selectivity. Due to the small mesh size, the codend selectivity for flatfish was very poor. The selectivity of the net body for flatfish was negligible. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Artisanal and recreational fishing were permitted in the Gulf. To assess the effect of the ban on the abundance of demersal resources, CPUE from experimental trawl surveys carried out before the ban (spring 1987 and 1989) and 4 years after it was in place (spring 1994) were compared. Sampling design was based on three depth strata (10-50, 51-100, 101-200 m); 71 and 30 hauls were made before and after the ban, respectively. Eleven target species (9 finfish and 2 cephalopods) as well as the total catch were used for comparisons. The total catch underwent an 8-fold increase in biomass after the four-year ban, and all the considered species underwent an increase, ranging from 1.2-fold for musky octopus (Eledone moschata) to 497-fold for gurnard (Lepidotrigla cavillone). The only decrease was for horned octopus (Eledone cirrhosa). A management strategy based on year-round trawling bans may prove useful, especially in areas where multispecies and multigear artisanal fisheries make up a large part of the fishing industry. The promising results obtained in the Gulf indicate an approach which might be practicable in areas where pre-existing data useful for traditional assessment and management are poor, or totally lacking, and where resources are already at risk of of overexploitation.

The searching phase is characterized by a below-average catch rate and a long distance between the midpoints of hauls. The exploitation phase is characterized by an above average-catch rate and a small inter-haul distance. During the exploitation of a local concentration of flatfish, the catch rate decreases on average by 10% over a period of 48 h. The rate of decline is a function of the engine power, powerful vessels experience a small or no decline in catch rate, whereas less powerful vessels experience a decline of up to 16%. It is inferred that the decline in catch rate may be due to interference competition among vessels through a change in the behaviour of flatfish in response to fishing disturbance, although a reduction in local abundance may also have contributed to the decline. Areas with above-average catch rates may change on a weekly basis.

The gear is expected to have a high impact on the entire benthic community, mainly on epifauna and organisms living in the upper sediment layers. To obtain information on likely medium- to long-term effects of trawl fishing in the northern Adriatic Sea, an experiment on immediate/short-term effects was carried out in an undisturbed sandy area near a wreck. The rapido produced flat tracks on the bottom that were still clearly visible after a week by means of sidescan sonar. The trawl did not change the sediment grain size, although it did disturb the upper 6 cm of sediment. Experimental trawling induced a modification in the macrobenthic community that was most evident immediately after the haul. Changes to the meiobenthic community were probably due to sediment disturbance and were recorded after 1 week. Comparison between an undisturbed control area and a neighbouring commercially exploited area allowed some evaluation of long-term changes in the benthic community.

The measured mean distance between vessel and trawl track (centre of headline) varied from 27 to 213 m during the 15 hauls for which measurements were obtained. The recorded maximum distance between the tracks was 336 m. The deviance appeared to depend on vessel heading relative to wind and current and on warp length. The magnitude of the measured distance between vessel and trawl tracks may strongly affect abundance estimates based on data from trawl catches. Depending on the avoidance reactions of different species and length groups to the approaching vessel, the track of the trawl relative to that of the vessel might influence both species and size composition of the catch. Experiments quantifying the relationship between bottom trawl catches and acoustic recordings under the Vessel will be particularly exposed to errors when trawl and vessel paths diverge. The magnitude of escape responses behind a vessel during trawling has been reported to vary within limited periods and over-restricted geographical areas. These escape responses have been documented using a towed underwater vehicle without knowing the exact position of the vehicle with regards to vessel and trawl. Measurements of the positions of the vehicle with regard to the position of the vessel and trawl during this experiment showed substantial variation both between and within hauls, indicating that at least part of this variability in fish behaviour could be due to the variation in position of the vehicle.

The ability of whelks to repair their damaged shells was studied in the laboratory. Whelks (n = 876) were caught with a fine-meshed 3-m beam trawl or with commercial 4- and 12-m beam trawls, while in some areas whelks were also caught with baited traps (used as a reference). Shell damage varied considerably for the different groups. Tn whelks collected by beam trawling, minor shell damage was observed in 17-75%, and severe damage (when protection against predators and scavengers is lost) in 10-83%. Whelks caught with baited traps sustained only minor shell damage (0-27% of the individuals). Their damage was statistically significantly less than in beam-trawled specimens. Most whelks in all groups exhibited signs of former shell damage, which had since been repaired. Whelk survival was studied in thr laboratory over a six-week period. Only 40% of the whelks caught with the 12-m beam trawl survived, irrespective of the damage suffered. Whelks that survived and recovered had repaired their shell after si weeks. More than 95% of the whelks caught with baited traps survived the six-week experimental period; this is statistically significantly higher than the survival of animals caught with the 12-m beam trawl. Ar five locations females were screened for the presence and stage of imposer. Mild imposer development (mostly stages 1 and 2) was observed at all locations with incidences of 32-80%. It is concluded that beam trawl fishery may be a much greater source of mortality in common whelks than previously thought. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J;"Sparholt, H; Tomkiewicz, J";"Sparholt, H; Tomkiewicz, J";A robust method for compiling trawl survey data used in the assessment of central Baltic cod (Gadus morhua L.);ARCHIVE OF FISHERY AND MARINE RESEARCH;English;Article;;;;;;;;Annual stratified bottom trawl surveys have been used since 1982 to estimate cod abundance in the central Baltic Sea. Catch at age from national research vessels is included in a common database, but data compilation is hampered by large differences in fishing power between vessels, mainly due to differences in gear size and design. In this study, indices of cod abundance and biomass are developed from arithmetic mean catch rates per depth stratum scaled by stratum areas, but with national trawl catches corrected for gear specific fishing power. The correction factors were estimated from catch rates of adult cod of all ages aggregated to minimise the effects of age determination discrepancies. The established index of spawning stock biomass did not correlate significantly better with VPA estimates than simpler indices ignoring depth stratification and fishing power. However, the method is preferable because it considers factors known to influence survey trawl catches.;"Int Council Explorat Sea, 2-4 Palaegade, DK-1261 Copenhagen K, Denmark; Danish Inst Fisheries Res, Dept Marine Fisheries, DK-2920 Charlottenlund, Denmark";;Sparholt, H (corresponding author), Int Council Explorat Sea, 2-4 Palaegade, DK-1261 Copenhagen K, Denmark.;"henriks@ices.dk; jt@dfu.min.dk";Tomkiewicz, Jonna/AAH-7526-2021;Tomkiewicz, Jonna/0000-0002-9695-2019;;;26;10;11;0;0;ELSEVIER GMBH;MUNICH;HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY;0944-1921;;ARCH FISH MAR RES;Arch.

These samples should represent the length distribution and species composition of the fish estimated by the sounder. Therefore the trawl has to catch every object in the volume of water sampled. To approximate this, the selectivity of the used trawl should be low. However, specially designed trawls are rarely available. Usually modified commercial trawls are used. Two research vessels from Sweden and Germany carried out a co-ordinated survey, to investigate trawl catch composition of high fish densities scattered layers of herring and sprat in the Baltic Sea. The analysis indicated that the selectivity for young fish was different between trawls because of the different mesh sizes in the codend. Thus, there is a need to estimate the real size distribution. A correction function was designed by applying selectivity data obtained from commercial trawls. However, these corrections are only possible for data obtained with mesh sizes not much larger than the optimum size. Results of this study also indicated that the larger the trawl, the larger the proportion of larger fishes in the length distribution. This effect could not be explained by selectivity. Thus further research is necessary. In every case it is advisable to check the selectivity of the sampling trawl in the described way. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

There was some evidence that up to 100 m above the sea bottom, pelagically distributed fish may supply the bottom trawl catch with fish. On the other hand, the dead zone as the most important giver of the additional fish caught could not be ignored. Also, there was not sharp evidence that pelagic distributed cod were available to bottom trawl in areas with high trawl activity. The influence of the physical factors, depth, moon date, water temperature and tide, on the pelagically distributed fish and the bottom trawl catch were investigated. Fish might tend to be in shallow water during the neap tide period and migrate to deeper water during spring period. The semidiurnal tidal pattern and water temperature appeared to have no significant effect on the pelagically distributed fish and cod catches. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Main effects in the models include a factor for vessel tonnage, to adjust for characteristics that determine fishing power, as well as factors for year, month and fishing closure. Vessel tonnage, season and year are shown to have a significant effect on hake catch rates, with vessel capacity alone explaining about 54% of the total variation in the data. Significant interactions indicate that monthly fluctuations in catch rates differed by year probably in relation to the timing of hake recruitment and of the bimonthly annual closure of the fishery. Hake abundance indices, as derived from the year coefficients in the model, were intermediate in 1991 and 1992 low in 1991 and 1995 and high in 1993 and 1996, This result is corroborated by abundance indices from survey estimates for the later years. The model explains 63% of the variation in the CPUE data, which is similar or above of what has been found by other authors in comparable studies for fisheries around the world. Thus, the modeling approach of catch rates from trawl fisheries offers a promising method for obtaining standardized abundance indices of groundfish stocks in the Western Mediterranean. Further application is the study of area effects on catch rates of fleets sharing the same resource in the region. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

A conventional 70 mm Nephrops codend and a similar codend with a 90 mm square mesh panel window inserted in the top panel were tested simultaneously in a twin trawl rig. Selectivity parameters and differences in catches of the target species Nephrops and the by-catch species whiting, haddock and cod were estimated. The logistic function was found to give the best description of fish selection ogives, whereas the asymmetric complementary loglog function described Nephrops selection best. The Fryer model was used to describe and compare the selection ogives for haddock, whiting, cod and Nephrops in the two codends. Due to low catches of cod and Nephrops only four out of 11 hauls could be used for modelling the selection of these two species. Selection factor and selection range were larger for the window codend for all fish species. The codend catch size had a significant negatively correlated influence on iota(50) and selection range for whiting in the window codend. There were large significant reductions in numbers of cod and haddock under the Danish MLS with the window codend. Catches of small cod, however, were low, Very few whiting under MLS were retained in either codend but there was a large significant reduction in individuals over MLS with the window codend. A large proportion of the Nephrops in the codends were under MLS. A reduction in catch weight of Nephrops over MLS was found for the window codend, but catches of Nephrops were low for several hauls.

In the present study the relationship between the day/night ratio of swept area estimates and fish length was examined for five species observed in the Barents Sea bottom trawl survey in winter in the years 1985-1996. Generally, most species showed increased catch rates during daylight at all sizes as compared with darkness. For cod the day/night ratio peaked at a length interval 23-31 cm with a substantial reduction for larger fish. For haddock the ratio was highest at the minimum size group, 12-15 cm, and decreased with increasing size. Some possible behavioural explanations for these findings are discussed. A change in groundgear during the time period analysed had a pronounced effect on the day/night ratios for all species. In addition there seem to be a tendency for the day/night ratios of catch rates for both cod and haddock to increase with stock size. This is a matter to be aware of when survey results are interpreted and used in stock assessments.

If the data are to include fish discarded at sea the scientists must sail with commercial fishing vessels to sample catches as they arrive on the deck. Commercial fishing is dangerous. In 1996, 20 fishers were killed and 26 vessels were lost in the UK alone. Trawling is considered most dangerous because of the frequent handling of heavy equipment. Catch sampling officers (CSOs) permitted by fishers to sail opportunistically on routine fishing trips are not in a position to demand high standards of marine safety as they might if the vessel were chartered. UK health and safety laws require the employer to ensure that all possible risks to staff are minimised, as far as is reasonably practicable. Therefore, when the English North Sea catch sampling study commenced in 1996, attention was given to the safety equipment, training and organisation needed to protect CSOs at sea. The resulting safety procedures and equipment are detailed in this note. Although tailored for UK legislation and climate, they may be a helpful starting point in other countries also.

International trawling effort in the North Sea: an analysis of spatial and temporal trends;FISHERIES RESEARCH;English;Article;;;;;;"beam trawl; fishing effects; fishing effort; North Sea; otter trawl; trawling";"DISTURBANCE; TRACKS; IMPACT";This paper describes trends in beam and otter trawling effort in the North Sea from 1977 to 1995, Data are presented as total hours fishing by English, German, Norwegian, Scottish and Welsh vessels for the period 1977-1995, and by Danish, Dutch, English, German, Norwegian, Scottish and Welsh vessels for the period 1990-1995. Analyses of temporal trends indicated that total international trawling effort in the entire North Sea has increased slowly since 1977 and that it is currently (1995) 2.25 million h yr(-1) of which 55% is due to beam trawling, Spatial analyses indicate that the proportion of beam trawling effort increases from north to south. Plots of annual fishing effort by ICES statistical rectangle (211 boxes of 0.5 degrees latitude x 1 degrees longitude) indicate that the majority of fishing effort in the North Sea are concentrated in a very few rectangles. Thus mean annual total fishing effort (1990-1995) was less than 2 000 h in 29% of rectangles and less than 10 000 h in 66% of rectangles. Total effort exceeded 40 000 h in 4% of rectangles, The results indicate that assessments of the average area swept by trawls in the North Sea give a poor indication of the direct impacts of trawling on the biota. Some areas are intensively fished but many others are not. Our dataset is likely to underestimate trawling effort in the southern North Sea (ICES Area IVc) because data for Belgian and French vessels were not available. However, the absence of French and Belgian data would not significantly alter total trawling effort estimates from the central (IVb) and northern (IVa) North Sea.

The effects of trawling disturbance on the fauna associated with the tubeheads of serpulid worms;FISHERIES RESEARCH;English;Article;;;;;;"biogenic structure; physical disturbance; biodiversity; bottom trawling; serpulid tubeheads";"MACROFAUNA; SEDIMENT; HABITATS";We report the effects of beam trawling on the diverse fauna associated with tubeheads formed by serpulid worms. Despite an experimental regime of biannual fishing, no changes in the number or size of serpulid tubeheads was apparent throughout the course of the study, and no significant changes were detectable in the composition of the tubehead fauna that could be attributed to fishing disturbance. A laboratory study revealed that tubeheads were unlikely to resettle on the seabed in an orientation similar to that prior to disturbance. Serpulids are known to be opportunistic species and may rapidly recolonise disturbed areas, such that we were unable to detect these changes within our sampling regime. Serpulid tubeheads provide an important microhabitat, a total of 73 taxa (50 species) being associated with them. Other similar studies indicate that these associated organisms are important food for small fish. In addition to increasing benthic biodiversity, they provide a potentially important habitat for juvenile commercial species, providing shelter and food.

Catches/escapements, size distribution, sea-age proportions, and mean weights of different sea-age groups were collected from official catch statistics and analyses of scale samples. In three of the Norwegian rivers, catches of grilse (1SW) increased significantly after the ban on the drift net fishery. No changes were recorded for multi-sea-winter (MSW) fish. In addition, the proportion of grilse increased in all the Norwegian rivers, and 2SW salmon increased in three of them. The mean weight of grilse increased in all four Norwegian rivers, whereas the mean weight of 2SW fish decreased in the two rivers in southern Norway. The size of 3SW fish did not change. These changes correspond well to actual net selection curves and reported mean weight of drift net catches in different parts of Norway. Trends in the Russian populations were more varying. In the three rivers draining to the Barents Sea, changes were similar to those in the Norwegian rivers. However, these changes were less obvious than those observed in Norwegian populations. The authors conclude that the ban of the drift net fishery significantly affected the structure of the spawning run in Norwegian Atlantic salmon populations. Furthermore, the results indicate that the drift net fishery affected Russian salmon populations in rivers draining to the Barents Sea to a lesser extent than Norwegian salmon, and had no effect in rivers draining to the White Sea.

Benthic surveys of a commercial scallop ground using a towed underwater television (UWTV) sledge revealed an expansive area of level, sandy sediment at 25 m characterized by high population densities of scallops (2.82 m(-2) Aequipecten opercularis but fewer Pecten jacobaeus) together with ophiuroids, sponges, and the bivalve Atrina fragilis. Rapido trawls were filmed in action for the first time, providing information on the selectivity and efficiency of the gear together with its impact on the substratum and on the benthos. The trawls worked efficiently on smooth sand with ca. 44% catch rate for Pecten jacobaeus, of which 90% mere >7 cm in shell height. Most organisms in the path of the trawl passed under or through the net; on average by-catch species only formed 19% of total catch by weight. Of the 78 taxa caught, lethal mechanical damage Varied from <10% in resilient taxa such as hermit crabs to >50% in soft-bodied organisms such as tunicates. A marked plot surveyed using towed UWTV before, then 1 and 15 h after fishing by Rapido trawl showed clear tracks of disturbed sediment along the trawl path where infaunal burrow openings had been erased. Abundant, motile organisms such as Aequipecten showed no change in abundance along these tracks although scavengers such as Inachus aggregated to feed on damaged organisms. There were significant decreases in the abundance of slow-moving/sessile benthos such as Pecten, Holothuria, and Atrina. Juvenile pectinids were abundant on the shells of Atrina. The introduction of a scheme of areas closed to trawling would protect highly susceptible organisms such as Atrina and enhance the chances of scallop recruitment to adjacent areas of commercial exploitation.

Intensive fishing occurred along the borders of the closed areas (12 mile zone and the plaice-box, a protected area in the eastern part of the North Sea) and at certain off-shore grounds in the southern and central North Sea. Effort distribution was studied within 30 x 30 (ICES rectangles), 10 x 10, 3 x 3 and 1 x 1 nautical mile squares and showed a patchy distribution. The degree of patchiness decreased with resolution. Within 3 x 3 mile squares, beam trawling was randomly distributed in some parts of the most heavily fished ICES rectangles but patchily distributed in others. Within 1 x 1 mile squares, the distribution became random within more than 90% of the squares. The micro-distribution showed a remarkable similarity between the 4 years with a mean coefficient of overlap of 0.66, range 0.56-0.76. The microdistribution of the sampled vessels was raised to the total Dutch fleet in order to estimate the frequency at which the sea bed was trawled. It was estimated that during the four year study period in eight of the most heavily fished rectangles of the North Sea, 5% of the surface area was trawled less than once in 5 years and 29% less than once in a year. The surface area of the sea bed that was trawled between 1 and 2 times in a year was estimated at 30%. The surface area trawled more than five times in a year was estimated at 9%. The relevance of the findings for the study of the impact of beam trawling on the benthic fauna is discussed.

J;Biseau, A;Biseau, A;Definition of a directed fishing effort in a mixed-species trawl fishery, and its impact on stock assessments;AQUATIC LIVING RESOURCES;English;Article;;;;;;"multi-species fisheries; directed effort; target species; metier; tuned virtual population analysis; stock assessment; NE Atlantic";CATCH;Catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) has frequently been used as an index of abundance and more specifically to calibrate virtual population analysis (VPA). In multi-species fisheries, CPUE calculated from fishing trips targeting the species seems to be more effective for calibration than the classical ratio total landings/total effort. Target species are determined from an analysis of the composition of catches (landings) of each fishing trip, each trip being categorised as to whether it targets the given species or not. It is obvious that existing but not reported discards would affect these results. Classification of trips can be achieved on a single-species basis, each species being considered successively and each trip possibly being relevant for more than one species. Using a more general approach, classification can be achieved by metiers, each of these being determined by one or a group of target species and each trip being categorised into one and only one metier. This method of categorising trips is based on thresholds of target species contribution to the catch and on an overall explanatory level. For the main species of the French demersal fishery off the west coast of Scotland and in the Celtic Sea, CPUEs are calculated using different methods to define the trips used to calculate fishing effort and associated landings. Besides important differences in actual values, CPUEs may also differ in their trends depending on the definition of directed effort. Tuned VPA, carried out for some species, shows that large variations in population estimates, fishing mortality or short-term predictions could occur when using directed effort, while the catchability model fits the data better.

Panels of 75-mm mesh size and 3 m length were positioned either 1 m in front of the cod-end extension, conforming with United Kingdom (UK) legislation, or 7 m in front of the extension, conforming with Irish (IRL) legislation. Forty-three tows of a twin Nephrops trawl were carried out from a commercial fishing vessel of the type using this gear in the Irish Sea, with different panel positions in the two nets. In a subsequent experiment, the twin trawl was separated into two single trawls and 40 parallel hauls were carried out from two smaller commercial trawlers typical of the single-rig Nephrops fleet in the Irish Sea. In each experiment, the trawls were deployed over a range of depths. Rigged as a twin trawl, the IRL net consistently caught fewer whiting below the minimum landing size (MLS) of 27 cm than did the UK net (mean catch rates of 72 +/- 10 and 131 +/- 14 fish per hour, respectively). Catch rates above MLS were almost identical in most hauls. In contrast, the panel position had no significant effect on catch rates of whiting of all sizes when the same nets were towed in parallel by the two smaller vessels. Possible reasons for these differences in results are discussed. As catch rates of whiting above MLS were not affected by panel position in both sets of trials, it is concluded that the more forward panel position would be most appropriate for Nephrops fisheries involving both single and twin trawls.

Changes in community structure within small spatial scales were subtle as species compositions formed part of a continuum over the entire continental shelf. Populations of low diversity were particularly evident in the German Eight and on the North Sea continental coast, where dab Limanda limanda were abundant. In the Channel and to the west of the UK the demersal assemblages were more species-rich than in the North Sea and, although dab was still an important member of the underlying fish assemblage, the abundance of other species, especially poor cod Trisopterus minutus, solenette Buglossidium luteum, plaice Pleuronectes platessa, and the lesser weever, Echiichthys vipera, allowed a range of different groups to be identified. Despite the greater species diversity in this westerly region only eight out of a total nineteen flatfish species were found in abundance. The dominance of different species in different size classes was a key feature of the community structure. Flatfish were the largest group by weight in the smaller-length classes (<30 cm), and in western areas the elasmobranchs dominated the larger-size classes. Observed patterns in community structure were partly explained by the zoogeography of the region and the presence of the British Isles at the boundary between two faunal types. The additional influence on demersal populations of depth and substrate type, which may regulate the abundance of flatfish at key stages in their life history, was also discussed. In addition to these natural processes, recent increases in fishing effort are thought to have affected the structure of the demersal assemblage, and an examination of aggregated length-frequency distributions from these surveys tends to support this conclusion. Without further information on the distribution of fishing effort, it is not possible to separate the influence of natural faunal changes between regions from that of artificial changes caused by fishing activity.

J;Dahm, E;Dahm, E;Measurements of codend selectivity for North Sea saithe by the covered codend and divided trawl methods;ARCHIVE OF FISHERY AND MARINE RESEARCH;English;Article;;;;;;;FISH;Trials for the determination of hitherto non-existing selectivity parameters for North Sea saithe were carried out in 1991 and 1994 with different mesh sizes and mesh shapes. In contrast to other gadoids markedly increased selectivity factors were detected for saithe. Square meshes did not improve the selectivity of bot:tom trawl codends for saithe. This fits with a picture of a vigorous fish which is not influenced by any shape of mesh in its impetuous attempts to escape. Thus, the use of a strengthening bag leads to no evident deterioration in selectivity for a given mesh size. If instead of the conventional covered codend method, double trawls are used for the determination of selectivity for saithe, an improvement: of selective properties (L-50, selectivity range) is noted after evaluation by contemporary software. The necessity of taking the uneven distribution of non-selected fishes into account, however, brings into question the validity of the results obtained.;Fed Res Ctr Fisheries, Inst Fishery Tech, D-22767 Hamburg, Germany;;Dahm, E (corresponding author), Fed Res Ctr Fisheries, Inst Fishery Tech, Palmaille 9, D-22767 Hamburg, Germany.;;;;;;26;9;9;0;1;GUSTAV FISCHER VERLAG;JENA;VILLENGANG 2, D-07745 JENA, GERMANY;0944-1921;;ARCH FISH MAR RES;Arch.

R.";THE IMPACT OF DREDGING WORKS IN COASTAL WATERS: A REVIEW OF THE SENSITIVITY TO DISTURBANCE AND SUBSEQUENT RECOVERY OF BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES ON THE SEA BED;OCEANOGRAPHY AND MARINE BIOLOGY <D>;English;Review;;;;;;;"POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT; MARINE GRAVEL EXTRACTION; SANDY BOTTOM COMMUNITY; SUBTIDAL WADDEN SEA; SEDIMENT RELATIONSHIPS; MACROBENTHIC INFAUNA; PHYSICAL DISTURBANCE; BENTHIC COMMUNITIES; PLANKTON COMMUNITY; CERASTODERMA-EDULE";The present review provides a framework within which the impact of dredging on biological resources that live on the sea bed (Benthic communities) can be understood, and places in perspective some of the recent studies that have been carried out in relation to aggregates dredging in European coastal waters. The impact of dredging works on fisheries and fish themselves, and on their spawning grounds is outside the scope of this review. We have, however, shown that empirical models for shelf waters such as the North Sea indicate that as much as 30% of total fisheries yield to man is derived from benthic resources, and that these become an increasingly important component of the food web in near-shore waters where primary production by seaweeds (macrophytes) and seagrasses living on the sea bed largely replaces that by the phytoplankton in the water column. Because dredging works are mainly carried out in near-shore coastal deposits, and these are the ones where benthic production processes are of importance in supporting demersal fish production, our review concentrates on the nature of benthic communities, their sensitivity to disturbance by dredging and land reclamation works, and on the recovery times that are likely to be required for the re-establishment of community structure following cessation of dredging or spoils disposal. Essentially, the impact of dredging activities mainly relates to the physical removal of substratum and associated organisms from the sea bed along the path of the dredge head, and partly on the impact of subsequent deposition of material rejected by screening and overspill from the hopper. Because sediment disturbance by wave action is limited to depths of less than 30 m, it follows that pits and furrows from dredging activities are likely to be persistent features of the sea bed except in shallow waters where sands are mobile. Recent studies using Acoustic Doppler Current Profiling (ADCP) techniques suggest that the initial sedimentation of material discharged during outwash from dredgers does not, as had been widely assumed, disperse according to the Gaussian diffusion principles used in most simulation models, but behaves more like a density current where particles are held together during the initial phase of the sedimentation process. As a result, the principal area likely to be affected by sediment deposition is mainly confined to a zone of a few hundred metres from the discharge chute. Our review suggests that marine communities conform with well established principles of ecological succession, and that these allow some realistic predictions on the likely recovery of benthic communities following cessation of dredging. In general, communities living in fine mobile deposits, such as occur in estuaries, are characterized by large populations of a restricted variety of species that are well adapted to rapid recolonization of deposits that are subject to frequent disturbance. Recolonization of dredged deposits is initially by these opportunistic species and the community is subsequently supplemented by an increased species variety of long-lived and slow-growing equilibrium species that characterize stable undisturbed deposits such as coarse gravels and reefs. Rates of recovery reported in the literature suggest that a recovery time of 6-8 months is characteristic of many estuarine muds where frequent disturbance of the deposits precludes the establishment of long-lived components. In contrast, the community of sands and gravels may take 2-3 yr to establish, depending on the proportion of sand and level of environmental disturbance by waves and currents, and may take even longer where rare slow-growing components were present in the community prior to dredging. As the deposits get coarser along a gradient of environmental stability, estimates of 5-10 yr are probably realistic for development of the complex biological associations between the slow-growing components of equilibrium communities characteristic of reef structures. Most recent studies show, however, that biological community composition is not controlled by any one, or a combination of, simple granulometric properties of the sediments such as particle size distribution. It is considered more likely that biological community composition is controlled by an array of environmental variables, many of them reflecting an interaction between particle mobility at the sediment water interface and complex associations of chemical and biological factors operating over long time periods. Such interactions are not easily measured or analyzed, but the results suggest that the time course of recovery of an equilibrium community characteristic of undisturbed deposits is controlled partly by the process of compaction and stabilisation that occurs following deposition. Biological community composition thus reflects changes in sediment composition, but is also in equilibrium with seabed disturbance from tidal currents and wave action, both of which show spatial variations and interactions with water depth. The processes associated with compaction and stability of seabed deposits may, therefore, largely control the establishment of long-lived components of equilibrium communities and account for the dominance of opportunistic species in the initial stages of colonization in unconsolidated deposits of recently sedimented material after the cessation of dredging.;"[Newell, R.

These areas are completely free of any salmonid mariculture, nor has East Anglia any significant sea trout rivers, the trout migrating into the area mostly from the north-east of England. These attributes provide an ideal basis for examining levels of infection in the absence of any potential interaction with salmonid farming activities. Counts of the two principal species of lice that occur on salmonids, Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Caligus elongatus, were made over a number of months in each year. The inter-annual and seasonal patterns of infection by both species showed mean intensity to be both low and fairly stable. The statistical distribution of the parasites amongst the host population generally showed levels of overdispersion (aggregation) typical of parasite populations. These results are discussed in terms of the dynamics of the parasite population, the interaction between parasite and host, and parasite transmission dynamics.

Salmon parr were divided in three groups each comprising 22 000 fish. One group was vaccinated by intraperitoneal injection with a non-mineral oil-adjuvanted vaccine consisting of formalin killed Aeromonas salmonicida, Yersinia ruckeri and Vibrio anguillarum (serotype O1 and O2). A second group was vaccinated by 1 h bathing in a corresponding vaccine without adjuvant. A third group was left as untreated control. Subsequently, presmolt groups were transferred to three identical net-pens located next to each other in the Baltic Sea (salinity 8 ppt), 500 m from the north-eastern coast of Bornholm, where they were studied for four months until tagging and release for restocking purposes. Mortality during this period in the ip vaccinated group was minimal (0.02%, RPS (relative per cent of survival) 99.80) and significantly lower compared to 10.13% mortality in the control group and 2.51% mortality (RPS 75.2) in the bath vaccinated group. Specific disease outbreaks were not observed during the four months. Growth was significantly enhanced in the injection vaccinated group compared to both the unvaccinated control and the bath vaccinated group. The humoral antibody response to the various bacteria was significantly elevated in the injection vaccinated group showing 4-5 fold titre increases three and four months after immunization. In contrast, no increase of titres was seen in the bath vaccinated and untreated groups. Marked cellular reactions in the abdominal cavity of injected fish were registered. A total of 3000 fish have been tagged and released to evaluate the effect of vaccination on the recapture rate. The implications of immunoprophylactic measures in the restocking programme with Baltic salmon are discussed.

The selectivities of three different cod-ends: standard, 15% shortened lastridge rope and narrowed circumference (to 120 mesh from 150 mesh), were measured for red mullet (Mullus barbatus L., 1758) and annular sea bream (Diplodus annularis L., 1758) in Turkish territorial waters of the Aegean Sea in June and September 1994. Selection curves and selection parameters were calculated using a logistic model. 50% retention lengths and selection factors for red mullet were higher for the shortened lastridge rope case and narrow cod-end than the standard cod-end. There was no significant difference for annular sea bream. This can be explained by the body shape differences of the two species. The effects of different cod-end designs on the selectivity are discussed.

The experiments took place at 12 stations in the western Aegean Sea and were based on the covered codend method (cover codend: 10 mm from knot-to-knot, 10D). The results of applying multivariate techniques, to the different station/codend combinations suggest that they form groups which differ from each other in terms of species composition, species diversity, and catch numbers/weights per hour of fishing. In general, the 10D covers of 20D and 20S were separated from the 10D covers of 14D, The 20D and 20S codends were generally grouped together and separated from those of 14D and 10D. Finally, the 14D codend either form groups by themselves or group together with the 10D cover codends. In addition, the results indicated that the 20D and 20S codends, when compared with 14D, allow significantly more individuals and number of species to escape through the meshes and are characterised by considerably higher commerical/non-commercial ratios in terms of both weight and number. In absolute numbers and weights 14D caught a very large quantity of non-commercial species whereas the weight of the commercial species caught was among the lowest. The commercial/non-commercial ratios of 20D were higher than those of 20S and, in absolute numbers and weights, 20S caught relatively more non-commercial species than 20D. These facts clearly indicate that 14D is harmful in terms of species diversity for the Hellenic demersal stocks and hence its use should be prohibited.

The contamination of the investigated dredge material was low according to the limited set of chemical parameters that was analysed, Nevertheless the three bioassays showed that some of the dredge material samples significantly affected the survival of oyster larvae and the amphipod B. sarsi, as well as the aerial survival time of mussels, Toxicity was reduced at the off-shore disposal site, probably due to the dispersal of the most polluted finer sediment fractions by strong residual currents, It is concluded that the sediment bioassays used for this study are a meaningful tool that should be incorparated in decision making frameworks for the management of dredge material.

Trends in survey catches for eight commercial species are compared with total stock biomass estimates derived from stock assessment. In general, there is a remarkably good correspondence between these two independent parameters, suggesting that the survey is capable of registering significant changes in abundance. Among the 40 species, there are many more showing a positive trend during recent years than a negative one. However, the commercial species are all either declining or are stable. The most significant changes are observed in ''southern'' species, which is probably related to a period of relatively warm winters after 1990. In many resident species, however, that appear to be increasing over a prolonged period of time, this explanation does not seem to apply.

In this colony, Audouin's gull behaves partly as a scavenger following the trawling fleet and exploiting fishing discards. Each year, the trawling moratorium affected different breeding stages of the species: in 1992 it overlapped with pre-laying and laying stages, while in 1993 it affected most of the chick-rearing stage. We examined differences in laying dates, laying interval, clutch and egg sizes, nest desertion during laying, hatching success, hatchling mass and condition, growth rates, chick survival and breeding success. The moratorium greatly affected egg production in 1992, delaying the start of laying and dramatically decreasing clutch and egg sizes. Intraclutch egg size variation be tween the 2 years suggests that egg size profiles are outcomes of the interaction between physiological and environmental factors rather than the result of ultimate factors. Nest desertion was much higher in 1992, probably because some females were under a critical body condition threshold and they deserted after laying the first egg. Hatching success also decreased significantly during 1992, probably related to changes in the size and the quality of the eggs. Chick growth and survivorship was higher in 1992, when trawler discards were normally available, than in 1993. Trawler discard availability during chick rearing was more important than egg size in determining chick survival. However, differences were not always significant, since in 1993 the moratorium did not start until the chicks were 1 wk old, and, further, chicks had higher skeletal size and body condition (in order of importance) than in 1992. In fact, chicks had similar fledgling condition in both years at the end of the rearing stage. In 1993, the overall breeding success decreased by 48%. Nevertheless, gulls' breeding performance for the 2 years was much lower than before the establishment of the first moratorium in 1991, and the situation suggests that clupeoids, the prey on which Audouin's gull feed, are scarce. It seems that gulls were not able to compensate for the lack of trawler discards during egg production, since the availability of secondary feeding resources was much lower in March and April (pre-laying and laying stages) than in June (chick-rearing stage). Although in long-lived species a decrease in food supply should affect fecundity before affecting adult survival, results confirm the importance of the trawler fleet activity for the conservation of this threatened species.;UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT SALUT PUBL & LS, E-08028 BARCELONA, SPAIN;;Oro, D (corresponding author), UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT ANIM BIOL, DIAGONAL 645, E-08028 BARCELONA, SPAIN.;;"Jover, Lluis/D-2192-2011; Oro, Daniel/H-4208-2012";"Jover, Lluis/0000-0003-0631-1398; Oro, Daniel/0000-0003-4782-3007";;;65;95;102;0;7;INTER-RESEARCH;OLDENDORF LUHE;NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY;0171-8630;1616-1599;MAR ECOL PROG SER;Mar.

The effect of this increase in twine thickness on cod-end selectivity for haddock was investigated in June 1993 on a Scottish commercial vessel. Cod-end selectivity was measured using a cod-end cover with supporting flexible hoops. The results were analysed taking account of between haul variation in selectivity, and indicate a significant reduction in selectivity with increased twine size. The change from 3.5 mm double twine to 6 mm double twine reduced the selection factor from 2.64 to 2.38. The reduction in selectivity is thought to be due mainly to reduced mesh opening and increased twine stiffness which both inhibit escape, but behavioural effects may also be important.;SOAFD,MARINE LAB,ABERDEEN,SCOTLAND;;;;;;;;15;46;49;0;3;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0165-7836;;FISH RES;Fish Res.;MAY;1996;26;03/Apr;;;;353;363;;10.1016/0165-7836(95)00418-1;;;11;Fisheries;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Fisheries;UL168;WOS:A1996UL16800011;;;;;10/01/2022

Beam-trawling is a source of physical disturbance to marine sedimentary communities in areas less than 50 m deep, on the western European continental shelf. Chains attached between the beam-trawl shoes are designed to penetrate the upper few cm of the sediment, which leads to the damage or removal of some infaunal and epifaunal species. In some areas, beam-trawling may be frequent and intense, leading to speculation that it may generate long-term changes in the local benthic fauna. 2. As part of a larger MAFF study examining the ecological effects of beam-trawling, we investigated its local impact on an infaunal community in the north-eastern Irish Sea. Studies of this type are complicated by the heterogeneity of the environment, hence we adopted a replicated, paired control and treatment design to maximize the chances of detecting any effects due to trawling. 3. A side-scan sonar survey revealed that the experimental area was characterized by mobile megaripples in the south-eastern sector of the experimental area and stable sediments with uniform topography in the north-western sector. Multivariate analysis of the species abundances from the control areas separated the fauna into two distinct communities which corresponded to the different substratum characteristics. Data from the two regions were therefore treated separately when testing for the effects of trawling. 4. In the north-western sector, trawling led to 58% decrease in the mean abundance of some taxa and a 50% reduction in the mean number of species per sample. Multivariate analysis revealed that differences between control and fished sites were largely due to the reduction or removal of less common species. These effects were less apparent in the mobile sediments of the south-eastern sector, which had a naturally impoverished fauna and high level of heterogeneity. 5. Univariate variables, such as abundance and the total number of species per sample, indicated that the variation between replicate samples increased as a result of trawling disturbance. However, examination of the community data using an index of multivariate dispersion revealed no difference between fished and unfished areas. This suggests that the effects of fishing disturbance are consistent between replicate samples. 6. Fishing with demersal gears modifies communities in relatively stable sediments. Frequent and repeated physical disturbance by fishing gears may lead to long-term changes in the benthic community structure of these habitats.;;;Kaiser, MJ (corresponding author), MAFF,DIRECTORATE FISHERIES RES,FISHERIES LAB,BENARTH RD,CONWY LL32 8UB,GWYNEDD,WALES.;;"Kaiser, Michel J/M-8543-2013; Langhamer, Olivia/J-3425-2012";Kaiser, Michel Josef/0000-0001-8782-3621;;;47;215;223;1;64;BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL;0021-8790;;J ANIM ECOL;J.

A side-scan sonar survey revealed that the observed abundance of trawl marks correlated with the reported levels of fishing al the sampling locations. The incidence of starfish, of both species, with damaged or regenerating arms increased with increasing fishing intensity. The severity of damage, i.e. the number of regenerating arms, also increased with fishing intensity.

A comparison between 2 breeding seasons of the lesser black-backed gull, one of them affected by a trawling moratorium, has allowed an assessment of the effects of discard availability on its egg laying. When trawlers operated, diet was dominated by fish from discards, while during the trawling moratorium gulls fed from refuse tips, olive tree fields and especially rice fields. Although neither breeding phenology was different nor was clutch size significantly lower in the year of the trawling moratorium, the volume of the eggs decreased significantly, showing the importance of trawler discard availability as a proximate determinant of egg production of scavenging seabirds. Since the moratorium overlapped with the chick rearing stages in both years, breeding success was probably lower than before the establishment of the trawling moratorium in 1991. However, the breeding success was higher in 1994 than in 1995, when the moratorium overlapped with the entire period of chick growth. Population dynamics of the species is probably affected by changes in trawler discard availability, especially if a trawling moratorium continues for many years.;;;Oro, D (corresponding author), UNIV BARCELONA, FAC BIOL, DEPT BIOL ANIM, AV DIAGONAL 645, E-08028 BARCELONA, SPAIN.;;Oro, Daniel/H-4208-2012;Oro, Daniel/0000-0003-4782-3007;;;29;55;56;0;5;INTER-RESEARCH;OLDENDORF LUHE;NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY;0171-8630;;MAR ECOL PROG SER;Mar.

A Marine Laboratory 'North Sea' 600 HP four-panel trawl was used throughout the study, A remotely controlled television system was positioned alongside the extension area of the net and observations of fish behaviour (mainly haddock and whiting) in natural lighting conditions were recorded on videotape for later analysis, The proportion of those fish entering the extension which escaped through the meshes was determined, With the black tunnel in place the behaviour of the fish was modified and despite their exhausted state fish swimming towards the codend were seen to turn and swim ahead of the tunnel. Fish approaching the tunnel tail first were seen to speed up and attempt to hold station ahead of it. In both cases fish appeared reluctant to enter the tunnel and many were observed attempting to pass through the open meshes ahead of the leading edge of the tunnel, The proportion of fish escaping from the three net configurations without a tunnel was low but increased with addition of the black tunnel. With a square mesh extension the effect of the tunnel was to raise the proportion escaping from around 18% to 77%, With a square mesh window, numbers escaping rose from 20% to 60% and, even with diamond meshes ahead of the extension, the proportion escaping rose from 5% to 40%, The results are discussed in relation to the selective efficiency of towed fishing gears.;;;GLASS, CW (corresponding author), SCOTTISH OFF AGR & FISHERIES DEPT,MARINE LAB,POB 101,VICTORIA RD,ABERDEEN AB9 8DB,SCOTLAND.;;;;;;0;64;66;0;12;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0165-7836;;FISH RES;Fish Res.;MAY;1995;23;01/Feb;;;;165;174;;10.1016/0165-7836(94)00331-P;;;10;Fisheries;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Fisheries;RA549;WOS:A1995RA54900012;;;;;10/01/2022

A total of 47 combined acoustic and gillnet surveys were collected between July and November 1987-1992 in archipelago areas of the northern Baltic Sea. Fish abundance determined by hydroacoustics was significantly correlated with gillnet catches but explained only 28% of the variance in catch per unit effort corrected for gillnet selectivity and fish swimming speed. Visibility (measured as Secchi disk depth) significantly decreased the likelihood of fish being caught in gill nets, while the effect of temperature was positive but nonsignificant. These data imply that gillnet catches will be a biased indicator of changes in fish abundance over time or space, if visibility and possibly also temperature change as well.;"UNIV STOCKHOLM,CTR MARINE RES,S-10691 STOCKHOLM,SWEDEN; CORNELL UNIV,DEPT NAT RESOURCES,BIOL FIELD STN,BRIDGEPORT,NY 13030";;HANSSON, S (corresponding author), UNIV STOCKHOLM,DEPT SYST ECOL,S-10691 STOCKHOLM,SWEDEN.;;;;;;47;61;64;0;21;NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA;OTTAWA;RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA ON K1A 0R6, CANADA;0706-652X;;CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI;Can.

Therefore, the fisheries should be identified and described with respect to species composition, spatial distribution, vessel characteristics, etc., and yield projections should be made accordingly. Cluster analysis was used to classify the Danish trawl fisheries in the North Sea in 1988. Classification of individual trips based on the species composition in value of landings for human consumption resulted in the identification of nine directed fisheries. Some of these were mixed demersal fisheries, whereas others were relatively ''clean'', being comprised of only a few commercial species. Classification of annual landings by vessel resulted in candidates for manageable units. The economically most important sub-fleet fished for industrial purposes, while the second most important fleet mainly targeted cod and haddock.

J;VANDERBURGT, C;VANDERBURGT, C;DEALING WITH CONTAMINATED DREDGED MATERIALS WITH REFERENCE TO THE OSLO CONVENTION 1972 AND THE NEW PARIS CONVENTION 1992;MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN;English;Article;;;;;;;;"Protection of the sea has received much political attention-for example, at successive North Sea Conferences environmental ministers have formulated a stringent policy with the aim of reducing pollution in the north-east Atlantic. In the past this area received many substances from many sources, but gradually intergovernmental action since 1972 in the Oslo and Paris Conventions has succeeded in tracing the major sources and understanding the effects of these inputs on the marine environment. After long discussion, many dumpings and discharges have been ended because they were considered harmful to the marine environment. Dredging activities were included in the discussions but they may be regarded as being a special case compared with many other disposals. In general, clean dredged material for sea disposal offers no problems, although restrictions may be caused by physical impacts, mainly to habitats for living organisms. However, this material also has positive, often even beneficial uses. In contrast, contaminated material disposal is restricted and the internationally accepted rule is that the material should not create hazards to human health, harm living resources and marine life or damage amenities or interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea. There are in principle three options for dealing with polluted sediments: doing nothing, remedial action in situ, removal of the contaminated material; occasionally treament is a possibility. The distinction has been made between the disposal of industrial waste, sewage sludge or dredged material. Industrial waste disposal is now prohibited; sewage sludge may be dumped until 31 December 1998, although dredged material may still be stored at sea under certain conditions. The Oslo Convention 1972 decided with regard to dredged material: that pollution has to be tackled at the source; dumping at sea is forbidden, although dredged materials may be excluded from this; land disposal prevails, although in several countries there is a growing resistance to disposal on land; there should be a precautionary approach against marine disposal; a stand-still principle should be followed where the quantities disposed in a certain year should not be exceeded nor should the quality of the receiving water be reduced; marine disposal should be phased out and, where appropriate, time-limits set; and the polluter pays. Dredged material is regarded as polluted and as a consequence may in general not be disposed of at sea when it contains substances listed in the Annexes of the Convention. Exceptions to this are indicated by the terms 'a trace contaminant', 'rapidly rendered harmless' or 'significant amounts'. Therefore, to achieve uniformity in the application of the Convention, guidelines have been prepared by a joint London Dumping Convention/Oslo Commission working group of experts on dredged material. Several characteristics must be considered when choosing a site for marine disposal and interests such as beach recreation, sport and commercial fishing, nature, cultural or historical interests, navigation, military interests and cables and pipelines should be taken into account. Also the capacity of the area to assimilate disposed matter per time unit must not be exceeded, especially in low energy areas. It is considered that in discussions of the environmental aspects of dredging it is important that associations such as PIANC argue for safe and economic navigation.";;;VANDERBURGT, C (corresponding author), PERMANENT INT ASSOC NAVIGAT CONGRESSES, HOF VAN DELFT ST 15, 2631 AH NOOTDORP, NETHERLANDS.;;;;;;0;6;6;0;4;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0025-326X;1879-3363;MAR POLLUT BULL;Mar.

In the sediment, many nematode species are present which may colonize the Spartina litter. Some of these species may affect the decomposition of Spartina detritus. A field experiment was carried out to identify these nematode species. Small mesh containers were filled with green or aged Spartina leaves to obtain different decomposition rates. The containers were placed in the Stroodorpepolder salt marsh (The Netherlands), in the Oosterschelde, a tidal inlet of the southern North Sea. After 3 mo the containers were collected and nematodes were counted and identified. The experiment was repeated in 4 subsequent seasons. Sixty nematode species were found in the containers; most species were found in all treatments. Total numbers of nematodes did not differ among treatments. Using multivariate analysis (RDA), however, we found differences of nematode community structure among treatments. Bacterivorous nematodes, particularly monhysterid species, prevailed in the containers with the highest decomposition rates. A positive correlation was found between decomposition rate and the numbers of Diplolaimella dievengatensis in spring, summer and autumn. The numbers of Diplolaimelloides bruciei, Monhystera parva, Desmolaimus zeelandicus and Theristus acer showed positive correlations with decomposition rates in 1 or 2 of these seasons. In winter no significant correlations were found. Thus, of the 60 nematode species present in the litter the abundances of only 5 species seemed to be affected by decomposition rate of the litter. It is suggested that these nematode species react primarily to the increased microbial activity coinciding with higher decomposition rates. In addition, these species may further enhance microbial decomposition activity.";NETHERLANDS INST ECOL, CTR ESTUARINE & COASTAL ECOL, 4401 EA YERSEKE, NETHERLANDS;;;;Alkemade, Rob/U-3663-2017;Alkemade, Rob/0000-0001-8761-1768;;;28;27;33;1;12;INTER-RESEARCH;OLDENDORF LUHE;NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY;0171-8630;1616-1599;MAR ECOL PROG SER;Mar.
