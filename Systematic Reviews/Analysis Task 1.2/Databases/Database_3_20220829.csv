The proposed data analysis strategy, namely to carry out a PCA of the temperature, cod recruitment and NAO time series followed by a CCA between the component spaces of all the possible data sets couples (recruitment vs temperature, recruitment vs NAO and NAO vs temperature), allowed us to sketch a general model of correlation between climate and cod recruitment dynamics. Two independent effects of temperature variability on cod recruitment emerged for the Kola region, pointing to the existence of at least 2 different mechanisms of comparable importance by which temperature may affect cod recruitment. In the North Sea the situation is somewhat simpler, and the data are compatible with only 1 major interaction mechanism. Moreover, the general effect of temperature on cod recruitment was opposite in the 2 regions: direct correlation for the Barents Sea, inverse correlation for the North Sea.

Throughout all experiments water temperature was maintained at 8.0¬∞¬±0.2¬∞C, salinity near 16.5‚Ä∞; eggs were artificially fertilized 1 or 6 to 7 h after catching the parent individuals and, attached to glass plates, incubated in 1 l aerated containers. In all test media brownish precipitates, which resulted from diluting the sulfuric pollutants with 50% sea water, tend to adhere to the egg surfaces, thereby possibly interfering with gaseous and other exchanges between egg and surrounding medium. Under conditions of maximum test medium effectiveness, percentages of successful fertilization and of egg survival are considerably reduced; diameter of fertilized eggs remains smaller; embryonic growth rate is retarded while the heart frequency tends to increase (indicating physiological stress); duration of incubation is shortened: percentage of successful hatching decreases and structural abnormalities of freshly hatched larvae increases. Dilutions down to 1:24000 and 1:32000 have rather limited effects. Exposure of 1 to 3 day old, healthy herring larvae to the 4 test media leads to failure of performing prey catching manoeuvres in 1:32000 and 1:24000, to impaired locomotory performances in 1:16000, and practically to paralysis, shrinkage, permanently bent bodies and death within a few days in 1:8000.

The feeding behaviour of sprat at a plaice spawning ground in the Irish Sea during February 2009 is described and their contribution to plaice egg mortality investigated. Acoustic observations and analysis of stomach contents revealed diel behaviour, with dense schools associated with feeding formed during daylight dispersing into thinly spread aggregations at dusk. Of 338 stomachs analysed, 95 contained identifiable prey items. Feeding activity peaked between 10:00 and 18:00, for all food groups. Numerically, gadoid eggs were the most frequently consumed prey (64), followed by copepods (25) and plaice eggs (7). Plaice eggs were present in 91 of the stomachs analysed. Converting stomach content data to daily consumption suggested that sprat may consume 73 of all plaice eggs spawned in the area. Predation by sprat appears to account for a large proportion of plaice egg mortality, so the abundance and distribution of this pelagic predator may have important consequences for the recruitment dynamics of other fish species. Moreover, fish eggs may be an important energy source for sprat during late winter, when alternative prey is scarce.

Significant seasonal variations in growth occurred which were related to water temperature. Growth rates remained constant between late December and March, but showed a rapid increase from April onwards. Spawning dates, back-calculated from the larvae at the onset of metamorphosis (stage 4b), occurred over an 18-week period from December to early April, with peaks in late January and early February. 0-group sole were collected in the coastal nursery ground of the Bay of Vilaine at the beginning (April) and the end of the settlement period (June). Otolith analysis showed that the first and largest batch of immigrants caught in April were spawned between late December and February (mostly in early February).

This impoverishment is expressed also in higher trophic levels and has been accounted for by several faunistic phenomena. One of these is 'Levantine nanism' (dwarfism); this is characterized by smaller body size of specimens in the Levantine basin compared with conspecifics in the western Mediterranean. Nanism has been hypothesized for various taxonomic groups in the Mediterranean, but no quantitative study has yet been carried out to confirm it. In the present study male and female red mullet Mullus barbatus from trawl surveys carried out along the Mediterranean coast of Israel and the Strait of Sicily were sampled. Each fish was sexed, measured for total length (TL) and aged by otolith readings. ANCOVA analyses indicated that the TL of both males and females from Israel was significantly smaller at increasing ages than conspecifics of the same age and sex from Sicily. In addition, preliminary examination of sexual maturity of M. barbatus of both sexes indicated that the Israeli fish sexually mature at a smaller size than conspecifics of the same sex from Sicily.

The low and unpredictable food supply in the southeastern Mediterranean may result in a form of r-strategy of the marginal eastern populations of this species that leads to early reproduction and smaller body size.

This impoverishment is expressed also in higher trophic levels and has been accounted for by several faunistic phenomena. One of these is 'Levantine nanism' (dwarfism); this is characterized by smaller body size of specimens in the Levantine basin compared with conspecifics in the western Mediterranean. Nanism has been hypothesized for various taxonomic groups in the Mediterranean, but no quantitative study has yet been carried out to confirm it. In the present study male and female red mullet Mullus barbatus from trawl surveys carried out along the Mediterranean coast of Israel and the Strait of Sicily were sampled. Each fish was sexed, measured for total length (TL) and aged by otolith readings. ANCOVA analyses indicated that the TL of both males and females from Israel was significantly smaller at increasing ages than conspecifics of the same age and sex from Sicily. In addition, preliminary examination of sexual maturity of M. barbatus of both sexes indicated that the Israeli fish sexually mature at a smaller size than conspecifics of the same sex from Sicily.

The work presented here, the spatial-temporal data framework, is part of a larger study, the NF-UBC Nereus Program, to develop a new approach to model interoperability for closing the gap between marine ecosystem modeling tools via geographic information systems (GIS) technology. The approach we present simplifies interdisciplinary model interoperability by separating technical and scientific challenges into a flexible and modular software approach. To illustrate capabilities of the new framework, we use a remote-sensing derived spatial and temporal time series to drive the primary production dynamics in an existing food web model of the North-Central Adriatic using the Ecospace module of the Ecopath with Ecosim approach. In general, the predictive capabilities of the food web model to hind-cast ecosystem dynamics are enhanced when applying the new framework by better reflecting observed species population trends and distributions. Results show that changes at the phytoplankton level due to changes in primary production are realistically reproduced and cascade up the pelagic food web. The dynamics of zooplankton and small and large pelagic fish are impacted. Highly exploited demersal species such as European hake do, however, not show clear signs of cascading. This may be due to the high fishing pressure on this species and the resulting strong historical decline in the area. In general, the development of the new framework offers ecosystem modelers with unprecedented capabilities to include spatial-temporal time series into food web analysis with a minimal set of required steps. It is a promising step toward integrating species distribution models and food web dynamics, and future implementations of interdisciplinary model interoperability. ¬© 2013 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,,Scopus,K,Mediterranean - CS,">100,000",multidecadal,"5,000-10,000",month,NA,Ecospace,3,2,3,NA,NA,Sardina pilchardus,juv and adults,Plankton,Biomass,NA,Mixed response,Small,"The study isn't based on experimental data and maybe and it probably should have been eliminated following the prescreening criteria.

Cytosolic metal concentrations in liver, kidney and intestine are tissue specific but in general decrease as follows: Fe ‚âà Zn > Cu > Mn > Cd. Metallothionein levels are also tissue specific with the highest level in intestine, followed by kidney and liver.

Associations of MT and metals that induce MT synthesis exist in liver for MT/Zn (r = 0.28) and MT/Cu (r = 0.26) and in intestine for MT/Cu (r = 0.38). Unlike essential metals, there is no significant correlation between MT and the toxic metal Cd, what is ascribed to its very low cytosolic concentration. The most pronounced size-related accumulation is found for the toxic metal Cd in liver cytosol (r = 0.69), indicating chronic Cd accumulation. Negative correlation between metals (Cd, Zn, Fe, Mn) and the condition factor also indicates chronic metal effects and their metabolic impact. ¬© 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Here, we use fish feeding behaviour, a biological trait easily impaired by trawling disturbance, to depict alterations in fish condition (i.e. individual fitness) and feeding opportunities. The benthivorous fish Mullus barbatus barbatus was selected as a model species. The observed trends of responses to trawling in prey species confirmed the effectiveness of a non-trawled zone in sustaining higher levels of diet diversity (e.g. quantity and quality of ingested prey) and fish condition values (e.g. morphometric and physiological Condition Index). Changes observed in fish prey selection confirmed the role of trawling disturbance in modifying the local soft bottoms community, producing alterations of prey availability that trigger shifts in fish diet. Trawling-induced feeding patterns, mirrored through stomach contents, can positively or negatively affect fish condition, the main driver of population dynamics in maintaining carrying capacity levels. Due to the widespread socio-economic value of the red mullet fishery, and the current exploitation status, evidence gathered by the proposed bottom-up trait based approach might inform future trawling adaptation strategies, and tailor spatial conservation measures supporting an Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,,Scopus,K,Mediterranean - non CS,">100,000",month,"500-1,000",month,Standard Fisheries Survey,average,3,2,3,NA,NA,Mullus barbatus,adults,Prey availability,Condition,NA,Overall negative response,Medium,NA,FOOD

The three independent sources of data all show that there is a significant relationship between the timing of spawning and sea surface temperature. Large mackerel are shown to arrive at the feeding areas before and leave later than small mackerel and the sequential appearance of mackerel in each of the feeding areas studied supports the anecdotal evidence for an eastward post-spawning migration. Occasional commercial catches taken in winter in the Sound N, Kattegat and Skagerrak together with catches in the first quarter IBTS survey furthermore indicate some overwintering here. Significant relationships between temperature and North Sea mackerel spawning and migration have not been documented before.

Although challenging, it is important to understand how predation mortality varies in space and how this spatial variability affects the temporal dynamics of fish recruitment. We investigated the spatiotemporal variability in the magnitude of predation mortality and survival of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the North Sea by combining a Lagrangian individual-based model of cod early-life stages (eggs, larvae and age-0 juveniles) with an Eulerian representation of its fish predators based on field data collected quarterly from 1991 to 1997. The mean and variance (spatial and inter-annual) in survival of cod were different between simulations using homogeneous and heterogeneous spatial distributions of predators. Survival of cod through its early-life period was 1 order of magnitude higher in simulations using heterogeneous versus homogenous predator distributions, mainly due to reduced mortality of eggs and larvae in the former simulation. Our model predicted markedly different year-to-year changes in cod survival, when heterogeneous predator fields were implemented. In the heterogeneous simulation, Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) and grey gurnard (Eutrigla gurnadus) emerged as the most important predators comprising, respectively, 68% and 13% of the predation mortality caused by 7 predators included in our study. A low (<0.1%) survival was predicted for cod progeny originating from known spawning grounds in the central and south-eastern North Sea while considerably higher survival (between 0.8 and 1%) was predicted for northern spawning areas and in the Southern Bight. Numerical sensitivity experiments indicated that seasonal and annual changes in the spatial distribution of predators were more important to the inter-annual variability in the modelled cod survival (52% of the mean survival) than annual changes in the biomass of predators (23%) and the variability of the North Sea hydrography (19%) with the relative importance of these factors depending on the life stage of cod. We argue that including spatial dynamics of predators will advance the predictive capacity of fish early-life stage models enabling more robust, science-based advice for spatially-explicit fishery management and marine spatial planning. ¬© 2019 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,,Scopus,K,North Sea - CS,">100,000",decade,"1,000-5,000",year,Simulated dynamics,Lagrangian stochastic drift module _ Eulerian representation of cod predators _ survival (exponential),2,2,2,NA,NA,Gadus morhua,"early life stages (eggs, larvae)",Predator pressure,Survival,NA,Mixed response,Medium,this study applies a series of mortality equations based on the spatial density of early stage cod predators and egg and larva dispersal (Lagrangian plot).

A general overall relationship can be seen between the number of summer spawned eggs and climatic change. Summer spawning was most intense in the warm period from 1935 to 1961, and has since declined with falling sea temperatures, but a detailed correlation fails owing to the great variation in egg abundance from year to year. Eggs spawned in the autumn months have become more abundant during the cooler period since 1962, and a significant inverse correlation can be shown between autumn egg numbers and the sea temperatures experienced by the fish during the previous 18 months. The scientific evidence suggests a recent cyclic fluctuation of pilchard abundance, linked with 40-50 year cyclic changes in the planktonic ecosystem of the W. English Channel. The historic records indicate similar fluctuations of pilchard abundance, but of undetermined frequency, for the past 400 years. ¬© 1974, Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.

From this material fish of 135-159 mm in length, a size class that was assumed to be preferred as prey by Baltic salmon, were selected and grouped according to species, sex and age. Herring were 1-3 years and sprat 3-13 years old. In addition, one group of smaller, two-year-old, female sprat was selected. Thus twenty groups were formed and prepared as whole-fish homogenates. Thiamine was quantified from all homogenates, while female and male sprat and female herring were analysed for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs). There were no significant differences between sexes within each species in the total thiamine concentrations, but the mean total thiamine concentration in 1 to 3-year-old herring (8.6 nmol g-1) was higher than that in 2 to 13-year-old sprat (6.7 nmol g-1). The mean-fresh-weight concentrations of total PCBs, coplanar PCBs, PCDDs and PCDFs were on average 2-3 times higher in 2 to 10-year-old sprat than in I to 3-year-old herring of a similar size, although the difference in PCDD concentrations was not significant. In sprat females there were no significant correlations between age or fat content and the fresh-weight concentrations of coplanar PCBs or PCDFs. However, the higher OC concentrations in sprat could be explained both by their higher fat content, with the younger age groups being the most fatty, and by their age, which reflects their slower growth rate. The fat-weight-based total PCB, PCDD, PCDF and coplanar PCB concentrations increased with age in sprat and, after controlling for age, there was a significant positive relationship between the fat content and the fresh-weight-based concentrations of OCs, apart from total PCBs. On a fat-weight basis the concentration of coplanar PCBs was also higher in sprat than in herring. It is concluded that the Baltic salmon is provided with an adequate supply of thiamine, at least for growth, from its two main prey species, Baltic herring and sprat. Furthermore, sprat might have been the principal source of organochlorines, particularly coplanar PCBs and PCDFs, for salmon. The concentrations of these compounds were earlier found to have increased in salmon coincidently with the outbreak of the M74 syndrome. ¬© 2002 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

The percentage of time encompassing this optimal temperature window exhibited a major contraction between 1995 and 2000 that may have contributed to reducing the supply of yolk-sac larvae and ultimately contributed to reducing recruitment observed after 2000. Temperature also significantly influenced the abundance of preflexion and flexion larvae, defining dome-shaped responses with maximum abundances observed between 10.27¬∞C and 13.43¬∞C and between 13.68¬∞C and 18.53¬∞C, respectively. The abundances of postflexion stage larvae were greatest at temperatures exceeding 14¬∞C with no apparent decline in abundance at temperatures of up to 20¬∞C. Temperature also played a significant role in influencing the abundance of larvae through its interaction with the abundance of the preceding developmental stage and provided evidence of stage-specific temperature-related mortality. There was also evidence of reduced survival during the preflexion‚Äìflexion transition in cohorts produced early in the season relative to those cohorts produced later. Although phenologically plastic species such as herring may be able to alter the dates of spawning, thus partially mitigating the effects of increasing rates of spring warming, constriction of the temperature windows for successful hatching and subsequent ontogenetic development may not be so easily mitigated by changes in phenology. ¬© 2018 The Authors.

The predominant signal detected was a non-linear negative relationship between adult size and mean Sea Surface Temperature during the first growing season. Herring length was negatively correlated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. Weaker associations with indicators of food availability and population size were also detected.

Declines in length and associations with temperature were more pronounced in the Celtic Sea population which may be vulnerable to increasing sea temperatures due to its position at the southern limit of the species distribution. ¬© 2020 The Author(s)",English,Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,K,Western Waters - non CS,">100,000",multidecadal,">100,000",year,In situ structural growth,GAM _ Gradient boosting regression trees,2,2,3,NA,NA,Clupea harengus,adults,Salinity,Growth,NA,Overall negative response,Large,NA,CLIMATE & OCEANOGRAPHY

The intake of most prey types was well described by a type II (decelerating) response, although in some cases a type III (sigmoid) response provided a slightly better fit. Though a saturation level was reached for all types of fish prey, none of the levels corresponded to the maximum digestive capacity of the predator. This was not caused by ingestion of other prey as the amount of other food and fish prey ingested were not negatively correlated. An investigation of the occurrence of fresh fish in the stomachs revealed that fish was ingested almost exclusively during dawn and dusk and the lack of negative correlation between the intake of fish and other prey may thus be a result of the limited time in which fish prey was vulnerable to predation. No aggregative response of the predators was detected towards any of the prey and catches of prey and predators were slightly negatively correlated. There was evidence of an increase in mortality with density at low clupeid densities, but mortality decreased to virtually zero at high densities. Whiting seem therefore unlikely to impose a regulatory effect on their fish prey outside a narrow range of prey densities. ¬© 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Over Great Sole and Cockburn Banks, there were various patterns in the hydrography and plankton which could be related to the banks, although there were no significant correlations with water depth. Away from the shelf-edge, stratification was lower over the banks. Higher water temperatures (at 5m and 100m depth) and increased concentrations of copepod nauplii and adults occurred on either side of Cockburn Bank. Abundance of mackerel (Scomber scombrus) eggs and larvae increased towards the shelf-edge, with lower numbers over Cockburn Bank. Over Little Sole Bank, water column stratification was negatively correlated with water depth. However, this was strongly influenced by shelf-edge mixing, which was reflected in reduced stratification towards the shelf-edge. Background levels of chlorophyll-a also increased from on-shelf towards the shelf-edge. Copepod adults and nauplii, as well as mackerel eggs and larvae were more abundant with distance onto the shelf. There was partial retention of four Argos tracked drift buoys on the south-east flank of Little Sole Bank. The mean displacement rate of the buoys was 1.35km day 1 over 10 days, with a mean dispersion of 1.2km day 1. A simple one-dimensional coupled physicalbiological model showed the potential influence of banks resulting in earlier stratification and resultant spring bloom. Considerations of the delay in transfer of production from primary to secondary production and the effects of drift and diffusion, suggested it was unlikely that any influence of the banks on production would be directly related to bank topography, but there might be some regional enhancement of production. ¬© 2008 Copyright Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.",English,Article,,Scopus,K,Western Waters - CS,"10,000-50,000",two year,5-Oct,month,CTD,regression,2,2,2,NA,NA,Scomber scombrus,"early life stages (eggs, larvae)",Other,Abundance,NA,Overall positive response,Large,Other enviromental drivers: Bank presence,Other

Stock assessments have recently revealed the worrying state of the ‚ÄúNorthern stock‚Äù, probably due to overfishing and a series of poor recruitments. The extent to which these poor recruitments are due to environmental variability is difficult to assess, as the processes driving the seabass life cycle are poorly known. Here we investigate how food availability and temperature may affect the growth and survival of wild seabass at the individual scale. To this end, we developed a bioenergetics model based on the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory. We applied it to seabass population of the Northeast Atlantic region (Bay of Biscay ‚Äì English Channel area) throughout their entire life cycle. We calibrated the model using a combination of age-related length and weight datasets: two were from aquaculture experiments (larvae and juveniles raised at 15 and 20¬∞C) and one from a wild population (juveniles and adults collected during surveys or fish market sampling). By calibrating the scaled functional response that rules the ingestion of food and using average temperature conditions experienced by wild seabass (obtained from tagged individuals), the model was able to reproduce the duration of the different stages, the growth of the individuals, the number of batches and their survival to starvation. We also captured one of the major differences encountered in the life traits of the species: farmed fish mature earlier than wild fish (3 to 4 years old vs. 6 years old on average for females, respectively) probably due to better feeding conditions and higher temperature. We explored the growth and survival of larvae and juveniles by exposing the individuals to varying temperatures and food levels (including total starvation). We show that early life stages of seabass have a strong capacity to deal with food deprivation: the model estimated that first feeding larvae could survive 17 days at 15¬∞C. We also tested individual variability by adjusting the specific maximum assimilation rate and found that larvae and juveniles with higher assimilation capacity better survived low food levels at a higher temperature. We discuss our results in the context of the recent years of poor recruitment faced by European seabass. ¬© 2020 The Authors",English,Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,K,Western Waters - CS,0-5,half year,0-5,day,In situ structural growth,Dynamic Energetic Budget (DEB) model,2,2,2,NA,NA,Dicentrarchus labrax,"early life stages (eggs, larvae)",Temperature,Survival,NA,Mixed response,Large,NA,TEMPERATURE

At a smaller scale, habitat parameters such as the relief of the sea floor, the presence of structuring fauna and prey availability may have a considerable influence on fish distribution, but often are not considered. In the present study we used video survey techniques to study habitat components in areas of the English Channel that were known to support consistently high densities of adult plaice. Habitat features were quantified and related to the density of adult plaice caught within the same study areas. To focus the study on habitat components other than sediment type all sites chosen had sandy substrata. The scale and spatial distribution and heterogeneity of physical and biological structures were quantified for each site and correlated to plaice densities. Plaice densities correlated with the abundance of benthic fauna recorded. In particular the emergent tube-dwelling polychaetes Lanice conchilega and Cheatopterus spp., which are a valuable food source for plaice, dominated some sites.

At a smaller scale, habitat parameters such as the relief of the sea floor, the presence of structuring fauna and prey availability may have a considerable influence on fish distribution, but often are not considered. In the present study we used video survey techniques to study habitat components in areas of the English Channel that were known to support consistently high densities of adult plaice. Habitat features were quantified and related to the density of adult plaice caught within the same study areas. To focus the study on habitat components other than sediment type all sites chosen had sandy substrata. The scale and spatial distribution and heterogeneity of physical and biological structures were quantified for each site and correlated to plaice densities. Plaice densities correlated with the abundance of benthic fauna recorded. In particular the emergent tube-dwelling polychaetes Lanice conchilega and Cheatopterus spp., which are a valuable food source for plaice, dominated some sites.

Abundant mid-trophic pelagic fish often play a central role in marine ecosystems, both as links between zooplankton and top predators and as important fishery targets.

However, since 2003, sandeel landings have decreased by > 50%, and many sandeel-dependent seabirds experienced breeding failures in 2004. 2. Despite the major economic implications, current understanding of the regulation of key constituents of this ecosystem is poor. Sandeel abundance may be regulated 'bottom-up' by food abundance, often thought to be under climatic control, or 'top-down' by natural or fishery predation. We tested predictions from these two hypotheses by combining unique long-term data sets (1973-2003) on seabird breeding productivity from the Isle of May, SE Scotland, and plankton and fish larvae from the Continuous Plankton Recorder survey.

The biomass of larval sandeels increased two- to threefold over the study period and was positively associated with proxies of the abundance of their plankton prey. Breeding productivity of four seabirds bringing multiple prey items to their offspring was positively related to sandeel larval biomass with a 1-year lag, indicating dependence on 1-year-old fish, but in one species bringing individual fish it was strongly associated with the size of adult sandeels. 4. These links are consistent with bottom-up ecosystem regulation and, with evidence from previous studies, indicate how climate-driven changes in plankton communities can affect top predators and potentially human fisheries through the dynamics of key mid-trophic fish.

Stomach content analyses of larval cod from the Bornholm Basin revealed calanoid copepod nauplii and early copepodite stages to be the preferred prey organisms. The results of the model runs indicate that larval cod changed from a nonlimited to a food-limited stage because of the strong decrease in abundance of the calanoid copepod Pseudocalanus elongatus during the last two decades.

Maintenance metabolism in fish scales with body size and increases with temperature, and the two factors together determine a critical threshold size for passive overwintering below which the organism is unlikely to survive without feeding. This is because the energetic cost of metabolism exceeds maximum energy reserves. In the present study, we estimated the energetic cost of overwintering from a bioenergetic model. The model was parameterised using respirometry-based measurements of standard metabolic rate in buried A. tobianus (a close relative to A. marinus) at temperatures from 5. 3 to 18. 3¬∞C and validated with two independent long-term overwintering experiments. Maximum attainable energy reserves were estimated from published data on A. marinus in the North Sea.

Two methods for estimating trophic position were compared. Scaling the isotopic enrichment per trophic level to the isotopic signature of the reference baseline produced lower trophic position estimates than those using the traditional assumption of a constant enrichment per trophic level. Indeed, the studied sardine population is placed as a mid trophic level consuming prey near the base of the food web. Zonal averages of trophic position increased with decreasing size of the sardine stock and increasing values of the upwelling index, suggesting the interaction of trophic relationships and population dynamics. The effects of changes in the timing of phytoplankton blooms and the release of competition for prey at low population densities were discussed as potential factors causing an increase in mean trophic position of sardine in recent years.

Years with high M74 incidence were characterized by stagnant periods with relatively low salinity and phosphate and silicate concentrations but high total nitrogen. Consequently, there were major changes in phytoplankton and zooplankton, with, e.g., increased abundances of Cryptophyceae, Dinophyceae, Diatomophyceae and Euglenophyceae and Acartia spp. during high M74 incidence years. The prey fish communities also had increased stocks of both herring and sprat in these years. Overall, this suggests important changes in the entire food web structure and nutritional pathways in the common feeding period during high M74 incidence years. Previous research has emphasized the importance of the abundance of planktivorous fish for the occurrence of M74. By using this 27-year time series, we expand this analysis to the entire ecosystem and discuss potential mechanisms inducing thiamin deficiency in salmon. ¬© 2020 Majaneva et al.

Man-made fibres derived from cellulose are distributed worldwide, but are often confused with synthetic plastic fibres and consequently neglected. All these fibres may adversely affect aquatic organisms, but their levels and potential effects in wild fish remain unknown. We analysed anthropogenic fibre (AF) ingestion in the red mullet (Mullus barbatus), at both temporal and geographical scales, to assess potential effects of these fibres on fish health condition. AFs were present in 50% of fish digestive tracts, with a mean of 1.48 AFs per individual (SD = 1.98). In Barcelona, an increase of 46% in AF ingestion was observed in 2018 compared to 2007. AF ingestion also increases by 20% when Barcelona is compared to a less urban area (the town of Blanes).

Pagasitikos Bay has the shallowest occurrence of Nephrops in high densities in Greek waters with an estimated population area of 376 km2. As trawling is by law prohibited in the bay, Nephrops is fished only by bottom nets. Burrow densities were estimated seasonally (May, August and November 1998 and February 1999) by video sled transects at nine stations around the bay. Bottom trawls were undertaken to estimate animal abundance, mean individual carapace length and mean weight. Total stock estimate (number and weight) was undertaken for 100 and 75% burrow occupancy with the ground delimited by the 60 m contour. Annual removal by fishermen was estimated to be 1.5-2% of the stock. Densities were found to be higher than in other Greek Nephrops grounds. Variations in burrow density were found both between stations and within stations over time, with an overall decrease in density in 1999. The decrease in density during 1999, in conjunction with an increase in mean carapace length from the trawl catches was attributed to an eutrophication event evidenced by a flock layer settling onto the seabed and causing, in the worst cases, patches of anoxic surface sediments.

Hake showed continuous spawning from February to July in the area. The centroids of hake egg distribution indicated a northward displacement of the peak of spawning as the season progresses. Spawning of hake was located close to the 200 m depth isobath in the southern area (Bay of Biscay) and it spread over the shelf in the area of the Celtic Sea. Eggs were most abundant at 20 m depth temperatures between 12 and 12.5¬∞C. The centroids of hake larvae distribution also showed a northward displacement although not as strong as that of hake eggs. The spatial distribution of hake larvae by size ranges showed important differences between years: in 1995 it suggested inshore transport of larvae, from the spawning areas (close to the 200 m depth isobath) to nursery areas (closer to the coast) while in 1998 it suggested offshore transport.

Existing archives, which house millions of fish otoliths (ear stones) constitute an excellent basis for such research; but, they remain underutilized. The objective of this project was to identify the factors that influence the annual growth patterns of the European flounder (Platichthys flesus) based on an analysis of otolith increments. We applied linear mixed models to develop a 74-year long chronology that reflects the inter-annual variations in flounder growth rates using otolith samples collected from 1957 to 2016 in the southern part of the Baltic Sea, which is considered to be highly vulnerable to global climate change. By analyzing the widths of otolith increments we revealed the existence of common environmental factors that influence fish growth. Using a mixed modeling framework, we incorporated a recent method to identify the optimal time window for climatic factors and showed that the most significant effect of the mean Baltic Sea Index occurs during August‚ÄìDecember, while mean sea surface temperature is most significant from April‚ÄìJune. Change point analysis on the developed chronology identified major alterations occurred in flounder growth in 1988, 1992 and 2006. This result is in accord with published studies on regime shifts in the Baltic Sea ecosystem. This paper reports information concerning the response of the commercially important European flounder to the changing environment that may support future ecosystem-based management of fish stocks.

As the stock sizes of cod, whiting and saithe have decreased significantly over the period, this offers a unique opportunity to test whether the expected decrease in natural mortality of Norway pout can be detected in mortality estimates obtained directly from abundance data. Two surveys, that cover the Norway pout distribution well, have been analyzed and both showed a clear decrease in total mortality consistent with the decline in predator populations. The estimated average predation mortality is similar to that obtained from Multispecies Virtual Population Analysis (MSVPA), but MSVPA does not reflect the variation in mortality over time.

Anchovy spawned mainly over the continental shelf of the Thracian Sea in the east (directly affected by Black Sea waters), and the semi-enclosed Thermaikos Gulf and Evoikos Gulf in the west. The surveyed area was therefore post-stratified into an eastern and western region and DEPM parameters, which, in certain years, differed markedly between the two areas, were estimated separately for the two strata. To increase precision of the daily egg production estimates, both eggs and yolk sac larvae were used assuming that the mortality rate does not change between the egg and yolk sac larval stage. Embryonic mortality increased as a power function of temperature. The estimation of spawning fraction was based on the postovulatory follicles (POFs) method and was particularly complicated due to the presence of strong thermoclines and diel vertical migration of the fish: POF absorption was very fast during the night, when fish were located above the thermocline (>20 ¬∞C), but relatively slow during the day, when fish were close to the bottom at ‚àº14-15 ¬∞C.

Anchovy spawned mainly over the continental shelf of the Thracian Sea in the east (directly affected by Black Sea waters), and the semi-enclosed Thermaikos Gulf and Evoikos Gulf in the west. The surveyed area was therefore post-stratified into an eastern and western region and DEPM parameters, which, in certain years, differed markedly between the two areas, were estimated separately for the two strata. To increase precision of the daily egg production estimates, both eggs and yolk sac larvae were used assuming that the mortality rate does not change between the egg and yolk sac larval stage. Embryonic mortality increased as a power function of temperature. The estimation of spawning fraction was based on the postovulatory follicles (POFs) method and was particularly complicated due to the presence of strong thermoclines and diel vertical migration of the fish: POF absorption was very fast during the night, when fish were located above the thermocline (>20 ¬∞C), but relatively slow during the day, when fish were close to the bottom at ‚àº14-15 ¬∞C.

However, the observed changes may also represent a plastic response to environmental variability. To disentangle phenotypic plasticity from evolutionary change, the probabilistic reaction norm approach was applied to 43 cohorts (1960 to 2002) of female sole Solea solea from market samples. The reaction norm for age and size at first maturation has significantly shifted towards younger age and smaller size. Size at 50% probability of maturation at Age 3 decreased from 28.6 cm (251 g) to 24.6 cm (128 g). This change was even stronger when condition was included as a third dimension in the reaction norm estimation. The influence of alternative factors was tested on the population level by regression of reaction norm midpoints on annual estimates of condition, temperature and competitive biomass. Although effects of temperature and competitive biomass were significant, the variation in the midpoints was best explained by the decreasing time trend.

K was negatively correlated with density, whereas no effect on L‚àû was observed.

Substrate information was derived from a remote acoustic classification technique (RoxAnn). Herring were shown to aggregate in areas characterised by a seabed of sand and gravel. This type of substrate is similar to that on which they spawn, yet the surveys were carried out 2 to 3 mo prior to spawning. The herring also showed a preference for zooplankton-rich waters with depths between approximately 100 and 150 m. These relationships were examined during 3 years (1992, 1994, 1995) using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and were found to be stable between the years examined. Results indicate a robust relationship between spatial distribution patterns and these environmental factors, despite substantial changes in the stock level and age structure of the population.

Eggs of the Western Baltic Spring Spawning Atlantic herring might be attractive prey for the invasive round goby during the spawning season. However, investigations of the small fish fauna in an important spawning area of herring, which was characterized by high densities of macrophytes, indicated a spatio-temporal mismatch of round goby and herring spawn in spring, at least on some of the known important spawning beds situated on vegetated sandy bottoms. In contrast, a spatio-temporal overlap between round gobies and herring spawn was observed in a more structured area, characterized with stones, where round gobies‚Äô stomachs were sampled. Further field study results suggest that large round gobies (> 10 cm) do not feed on herring eggs, while smaller round gobies (< 10 cm) do so. To support these results, we conducted laboratory feeding experiments with round gobies. When C. crangon, M. edulis and herring eggs were offered simultaneously, round gobies preferred C. crangon. M. edulis was preferred over herring eggs when C. crangon was absent. The predatory impact of the round goby on herring eggs seems to be of minor importance compared to other species, such as three-spined stickleback or perch. Applying the same data, different food ‚Äòpreference indices‚Äô revealed a discrepancy in preference between indices. Therefore, we propose a modified food preference index (mE), taking into account four important parameters and combining benefits of two commonly applied indices. ¬© 2019, ¬© 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",English,Article,,Scopus,K,Baltic Sea - CS,50-100,two year,0-5,half year,Fisheries Dependent Data _ Stomach Contents Analyses _ laboratory experiments,One way anova _ Paired t-test _  Man-Whitney-U-test,2,2,3,NA,NA,Clupea harengus,"early life stages (eggs, larvae)",Predator pressure,Survival,Relative Importance-index _ Ivlevís electivity-index _ the modified Ivlevís electivity index,Mixed response,Small,"The response depends on fish size.

Female flounder (Platichthys flesus) collected from three locations in the southern Baltic Sea in February 2010 were examined for biomarkers of exposure to genotoxic agents (DNA damage), AhR-active contaminants (ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase, EROD activity), and somatic condition indexes. Organochlorine contaminants (OCs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolites were also measured in individual flounder to evaluate the biological responses in the context of contaminant burden. The genotoxicity, mildly exceeding a background level, revealed a significant relationship with mono-ortho substituted PCB ( m-o PCB). Hepatic EROD activity was highly induced, yet showed no association with any of the contaminants measured other than biliary 1-OH pyrene normalized to pigment absorbance. Significant negative relationships were observed for lipid-based OCs and the gonado-somatic index (GSI) as well as for Œ£ m-o PCB concentrations and the condition factor (CF). Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed an overall connection between somatic condition indexes, biomarkers, and chemical variables.

The Baltic Sea comprises a heterogeneous oceanographic environment that structures the spatial and temporal distribution of the dominant species cod, herring, and sprat (Sprattus sprattus). Despite local differences, the stocks are traditionally managed as homogeneous units. Here, we present a metacommunity-perspective on source-sink dynamics of Baltic Sea fish stocks by using a spatially disaggregated statistical food web model. The model is fitted to area-specific time series of multiple abiotic and biotic variables using state-space methods. Our analysis reveals pronounced net fluxes between areas, indicative of source-sink dynamics, as well as area-specific differences in species interactions (i.e., density dependence, competition, and predator-prey) and the degree of fishing and climate impact on survival and recruitment.

Climatic influences documented to affect various ecological functions on a global scale, may themselves be observed on quantitative or qualitative scales including regime shifts in complex marine ecosystems. This study investigates the potential climatic impact on the reproduction success of spring-spawning herring (Clupea harengus) in the Western Baltic Sea (WBSS herring). To test for climate effects on reproduction success, the regionally determined and scientifically well-documented spawning grounds of WBSS herring represent an ideal model system. Climate effects on herring reproduction were investigated using two global indices of atmospheric variability and sea surface temperature, represented by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO), respectively, and the Baltic Sea Index (BSI) which is a regional-scale atmospheric index for the Baltic Sea. Moreover, we combined a traditional approach with modern time series analysis based on a recruitment model connecting parental population components with reproduction success. Generalized transfer functions (ARIMAX models) allowed evaluating the dynamic nature of exogenous climate processes interacting with the endogenous recruitment process. Using different model selection criteria our results reveal that in contrast to NAO and AMO, the BSI shows a significant positive but delayed signal on the annual dynamics of herring recruitment. The westward influence of the Siberian high is considered strongly suppressing the influence of the NAO in this area leading to a higher explanatory power of the BSI reflecting the atmospheric pressure regime on a North-South transect between Oslo, Norway and Szczecin, Poland. We suggest incorporating climate-induced effects into stock and risk assessments and management strategies as part of the EU ecosystem approach to support sustainable herring fisheries in the Western Baltic Sea. ¬© 2014 Gr√∂ ger et al.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,K,Baltic Sea - CS,">100,000",decade,NA,year,Simulated dynamics _ Regular Fisheries Independent Survey _ Fisheries Dependent Data,ARIMA modelling,2,2,3,NA,NA,Clupea harengus,juv and adults,Climate,Reproduction,NA,Overall positive response,Large,NA,CLIMATE & OCEANOGRAPHY

Time was significant for the feeding activity of medium larvae indicating some unexplained variability that was not taken into account by the studied abiotic and biotic variables. ¬© 2011 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,,Scopus,K,Baltic Sea - CS,"50,000-100,000",five year,"5,000-10,000",week,Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey,Repeated measures analysis of covariance _ ANCOVA,2,2,3,NA,NA,Clupea harengus,"early life stages (eggs, larvae)",Hydrodynamics & winds,Other,Feeding activity index,Mixed response,Medium,The response depends on larval herring size,CLIMATE & OCEANOGRAPHY

As herring feeding is known to be selective, it is relevant to access its preferences upon zooplankton species and particular copepod developmental stages to forecast possible intraspecific competition for resources in the species scarce environment of the Gulf of Riga where herring stock size due to successful recruitment has almost doubled since 1989. This study tries to answer whether the small-sized plankters dominated zooplankton community permits herring to be a selective eater. Also how herring body condition has changed in connection to environment driven zooplankton community changes. The time series of zooplankton abundance and herring condition from 1995-2012 were studied; and a detailed study of herring diet was performed monthly by stomach content analysis during the main feeding season in 2011 and 2012. We found that herring selectively prey on Limnocalanus macrurus and older copepodite stages of Eurytemora affinis, and moreover these were species of whose selected copepodite stages explained most of variation in herring condition factor. The found relationship between herring feeding selectivity and long-term variation of herring condition allows applying spring zooplankton abundance of E. affinis and L. macrurus to estimate favourable feeding conditions for herring, and could also require the revision of currently used model for herring recruitment estimations, where only biomass of E. affinis is taken into account. In recent years, the high condition of herring can be associated with a considerable increase of lipid-rich copepod species L. macrurus. ¬© 2015 Institute of Oceanology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,K,Baltic Sea - CS,">100,000",multidecadal,NA,year,Fisheries Dependent Data,Pearson correlation,NA,2,3,"We found that herring selectively prey on Limnocalanus cramurus and older copepodite stages of Eurytemora affinis, and moreover these were species of whose selected copepodite stages explained most of the variation in herring condition factor.

A decomposing algal mat rapidly induces hypoxic or anoxic conditions in the underlying sediment and interferes with the normal living-mode of the benthos, i.e., mobility, feeding, and predator-prey relationships. Field surveys have shown that bivalves, such as Macoma balthica, avoid the unfavourable anoxic conditions by emerging at the sediment surface. Due to low reburrowing rates these bivalves are exposed to epibenthic predators once the drift algae disperse. A series of aquarium experiments were conducted to test for differences in the survival of M. balthica when exposed to continuous predation without prior stress and short-term predation after hypoxic stress induced by algae (‚âà 20% O2-saturation). Sublethally stressed adult M. balthica, that normally are outside the size-range of the isopod predator Saduria entomon, became significantly more susceptible to predation when lying exposed at the sediment surface. The same effects were found with two other predators, the brown-shrimp Crangon crangon and the flounder Platichthys flesus. Drift algal mats induced an escape-reaction in the infauna more rapidly than mere hypoxia. This response is affected by temperature, which further underlines the importance of drift algae influencing prey availability. This paper discusses the role of the drift algae as a regulating factor for the infauna and demonstrates the importance of external structuring factors, such as hypoxic stress and algal mats, on predator-prey interactions.",English,Article,,Scopus,K,Baltic Sea - CS,0-5,week,0-5,week,NA,ANOVA _ t-test,NA,NA,NA,NA,lab study,Platichthys flesus,adults,Eutrophication & Nutrients,Other,NA,Overall positive response,Large,NA,ABIOTIC ANTHROPIC

Our experiments documented that vitellogenesis generally starts at autumnal equinox and that oocyte growth and investment are greater in cod held at warmer temperatures. Furthermore, spawning occurred earlier when oocyte growth was more rapid. Large females spawned earlier than smaller females at warmer temperatures, but this effect vanished at colder temperatures. The experimental results were confirmed by measurements of oocyte growth collected from wild-caught cod in northern (Barents Sea) and southern (Irish Sea and North Sea) populations.

We sampled juveniles during 3 trawl surveys in the GB in August, September, and October 2004 and applied otolith microstructure analysis in order to reconstruct their distributions of the day-of-first-increment-formation (dif). These were contrasted with spatial and seasonal patterns of sprat egg abundance in the GB and its adjacent areas, observed during 6¬†monthly plankton surveys. It was found that the majority of juveniles originated mainly from April/May 2004, coinciding with high spawning activity west of the GB, whereas spawning and larval production inside the GB peaked notably later, in May/June. This indicated that a large proportion of juveniles was produced outside the GB and transported subsequently into it through passive and/or active migration. Shifts to later mean difs from one survey to the next and length distributions indicative of the simultaneous presence of multiple cohorts, supported the notion that the GB is a complex retention and nursery area for sprat offspring from different North Sea spawning grounds and times. Later born juveniles had significantly faster initial growth rates than earlier born conspecifics, which was likely temperature-mediated, given the strong correlation between back-calculated growth histories and sea surface temperature as a proxy for thermal histories of juveniles (r2 = 0.52). ¬© 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Skewed sex ratios with a predominance of males were observed in the survey catches of 2- and 3-year-old cod taken on the spawning grounds. In contrast, commercial midwater trawl catches of cod in the same area had consistently higher sex ratios, suggesting that mature males and females have different vertical migration behaviour. Estimates of proportion mature were not affected by method of capture. In a GLM analysis, the factor age explained most of the variation in maturity in each sex, whilst length, although a significant factor, explained less variation than year and region (spawning and non-spawning grounds). Maturity was observed in a variable proportion of 2-year-olds, whilst virtually no 1-year-olds and all 3-year-olds and older were mature irrespective of area or year of capture. Population estimates of proportion mature in 2-year-olds, from all years' data combined, were 0.87 in males and 0.45 in females. Estimates were higher in spawning areas than in non-spawning areas, and showed a general increase over time throughout the survey area. However, in any year, the proportion mature at age 2 varied little with length and was reduced only in the smallest fish (< 40 cm) at this age in some years. The increase over time in proportion mature coincided with rising sea surface temperature (SST) and a decline in recruitment and stock biomass at high rates of fishing mortality. Mean length-at-age differed consistently between year classes, the differences being largely established in the first year of life. The fastest growth rates were apparent in very weak year classes produced in the late 1990s when SST was relatively high. The interrelationships between growth, maturity, SST and abundance are examined, and changes in growth and maturity since earlier studies in the 1970s are investigated. ¬© 2003 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Some marine fish larvae are potentially more sensitive to low salinity than older stages, hence we compared the low salinity tolerance of Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) larvae at the individual and population levels including four populations in the North and Baltic Seas. Acute low salinity tolerance was similar (S = 1.9-2.7) across populations and increased with increasing body size. Based on this physiological threshold and a regionally down-scaled climate model, spawning habitats in the northern and eastern Baltic Sea are projected to be largely unsuitable for herring by 2100. Although adaptive mechanisms may attenuate the effect in some species, the limited physiological tolerance of fish larvae will remain an important bottleneck for the persistence of marine fish populations in brackish waters undergoing climate-driven freshening. ¬© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",English,Article,,Scopus,K,Baltic Sea - CS,0-5,month,0-5,day,NA,nonlinear regression _ ANOVA _ pairwise multiple comparison post-hoc test,NA,NA,NA,NA,lab study,Clupea harengus,"early life stages (eggs, larvae)",Salinity,Survival,NA,Overall positive response,Large,NA,CLIMATE & OCEANOGRAPHY

During their juvenile stage they concentrate in coastal nursery areas. Food conditions in these areas are an important factor determining habitat quality and ultimate survival. Recently, growth reduction in summer has been observed in plaice, Pleuronectes platessa, feeding on both epibenthic and benthic prey. In the current study, we test the hypothesis that summer growth reduction is a consequence of a reduced availability of benthic prey by analysing summer growth in a fully benthic feeding flatfish, juvenile sole (Solea solea). Summer growth was studied for contrasting years with respect to preceding winter water temperature conditions to exclude possible irreversible non-genetic adaptations of growth to water temperature. Individual growth, estimated from otolith daily rings, was compared with predictions of maximum growth at the prevailing temperature. In line with expectations, 0-group sole showed strong summer growth reduction, supporting the notion that summer growth reduction is related to feeding modes. Summer growth reduction underlines the importance of a good definition of how and over what time period growth as indicator of habitat quality is estimated and compared. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,K,North Sea - CS,"5,000-10,000",five year,"500-1,000",year,Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey,no statistical inference,2,2,2,NA,NA,Solea solea,juveniles,Other,Growth,Driver: season; Process: summer growth reduction,NA,NA,NA,Other

Temperature during the first year has a strong influence on subsequent weight-at-age of cod in the North Sea and may account for much of the observed variability up to six years of age. The relationship between temperature and recruitment is weak for individual stocks of cod (with the exception of West Greenland), but when several stocks are looked at together a pattern emerges, in which recruitment is highest in the range 5-7¬∞C. The problems of designing appropriate estimates of temperature for growth or recruitment studies are discussed in the light of recent work on fish distribution and behaviour.

In the Western Baltic cod stock socio-ecological links are particularly important, with many relying on cod for their livelihoods. A series of recent experiments revealed that cod populations are negatively affected by climate change, but an ecological-economic assessment of the combined effects, and advice on optimal adaptive management are still missing. For Western Baltic cod, the increase in larval mortality due to ocean acidification has experimentally been quantified. Time-series analysis allows calculating the temperature effect on recruitment. Here, we include both processes in a stock-recruitment relationship, which is part of an ecological-economic optimization model. The goal was to quantify the effects of climate change on the triple bottom line (ecological, economic, social) of the Western Baltic cod fishery. Ocean warming has an overall negative effect on cod recruitment in the Baltic. Optimal management would react by lowering fishing mortality with increasing temperature, to create a buffer against climate change impacts. The negative effects cannot be fully compensated, but even at 3 ¬∞C warming above the 2014 level, a reduced but viable fishery would be possible. However, when accounting for combined effects of ocean warming and acidification, even optimal fisheries management cannot adapt to changes beyond a warming of +1.5¬∞ above the current level. Our results highlight the need for multi-factorial climate change research, in order to provide the best available, most realistic, and precautionary advice for conservation of exploited species as well as their connected socio-economic systems. ¬© 2019 The Authors",English,Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,K,Baltic Sea - CS,">100,000",multidecadal,"50,000-100,000",year,Fisheries Dependent Data,Ordinary Least squares,3,3,3,NA,"modelling study, but estimates the effect of T∞ on SR relationsip to paramtrise the model",Gadus morhua,"early life stages (eggs, larvae)",Temperature,Reproduction,number of recruits vs T (and SSB),Overall positive response,NA,SR relationship with T∞ included,TEMPERATURE

In coastal marine ecosystems all over the world, eutrophication is a primary water quality issue, often resulting in mass developments of bloom-forming algae. Macro-algal blooms have immense ecological effects, as they alter the structure and the function of an ecosystem. Numerous fish species are affected, as they depend on those coastal areas for spawning and as juvenile habitats. A comparison of the survival of herring eggs on two natural spawning beds re-vealed an immense impact of a filamentous algal bloom. The mortality rate reached nearly 100% in the area with massive occurrence of filamentous brown algae. Hypothesizing that the presence of filamentous algae facilitates herring egg mortality, field and laboratory experiments were conducted and revealed particular effects of distinct algal species. The survival rate of artificially spawned eggs on algal substrates and control substrates was compared. Whereas filamentous forms of the green alga Ulva intestinalis induced no immediate effect, significantly higher egg mortality was documented in experiments with the filamentous brown alga Pylaiella littoralis. Considering the ecological and economical importance of herring and other coastal spawners on the one hand and the persisting and increasing effects of eutrophication and climate change on the other hand, the results of our study clearly underpin the necessity to increase global efforts to reduce nutrient loads in coastal waters. ¬© 2020 The Authors.

We combined an in situ predator exclusion experiment using eggs naturally spawned on submerged aquatic vegetation and field observations of predator abundance to estimate the magnitude of predation mortality of herring eggs. During our predator exclusion experiment, performed in an important spawning ground in the southwest Baltic Sea, 20% of the herring eggs were consumed resulting in an extrapolated predation of 42% of all eggs between spawning and hatch. Abundance and stomach content analyses indicated that one predator (threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus) was responsible for the majority of the predation impact. Predation mortality estimates from this in situ study were more than 10-fold higher than those of an empirical egg predation model for the same predator in the same region. Our findings highlight the potential of resident predators to regulate the survival of early life stages of ocean-going fishes that rely on the nursery functions of inshore transitional waters. ¬© 2017 The Authors Limnology and Oceanography published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography",English,Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,K,Baltic Sea - CS,"10,000-50,000",two month,NA,week,Active Net Capture,anova,3,3,3,NA,NA,Clupea harengus,"early life stages (eggs, larvae)",Predator pressure,Survival,"threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus",Overall negative response,Large,"estimated 42% predation of all eggs between spawning and hatch (resdient predator community, but mainly Gasterosteus aculeatus",PREDATOR

Moderate to strong levels of DDM (direct or delayed) were estimated in eight of the 11 populations. Variability in the 0-group (corrected for observation errors) appeared to be large for most of the populations. Substantial stochastic variability in postsettlement survival was also detected in some areas, indicating that stochastic factors are not only important for egg and larval stages, as stated by the match-mismatch hypothesis, but also for juveniles. We show that the variability in these coastal populations is not only regulated as a function of the strength of DDM processes, but also as an interaction between DDM processes and stochastic factors.

Using field data collected during a 33-year period, we show for the first time a four-level community-wide trophic cascade in the open Baltic Sea. The dramatic reduction of the cod (Gadus morhua) population directly affected its main prey, the zooplanktivorous sprat (Sprattus sprattus), and indirectly the summer biomass of zooplankton and phytoplankton (top-down processes). Bottom-up processes and climate-hydrological forces had a weaker influence on sprat and zooplankton, whereas phytoplankton variation was explained solely by top-down mechanisms. Our results suggest that in order to dampen the occasionally harmful algal blooms of the Baltic, effort should be addressed not only to control anthropogenic nutrient inputs but also to preserve structure and functioning of higher trophic levels. ¬© 2008 The Royal Society.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,K,Baltic Sea - CS,">100,000",multidecadal,">100,000",quarter,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey,Pearson correlations _ GLM,2,3,NA,NA,NA,Sprattus sprattus,juv and adults,Plankton,Biomass,NA,overall negative response,Medium,"0,008 _ chloroa vs zooplankton, indirect effect of sprat abundance on phytoplankton",FOOD

Using variation partitioning based on generalized additive models, daily fluctuations in hydroacoustic abundance estimates were first eliminated, and the remaining variation in fish abundance was decomposed into independent and joint effects of hydrography, food resources, and geography. The independent effect of geographic variables (spatial location and water depth) captured the largest fraction of the variation (9.3%) in the fish-abundance patterns, whereas the independent effects of hydrography (5.8%) and food resources (5.6%) captured slightly less. However, a considerable portion of the variation in fish-abundance patterns was accounted for by the joint effects of explanatory variables and may therefore be causally related to two or all three groups of variables. The model applied efficiently eliminated the spatial autocorrelation in the fish abundance between sampling units, especially at distances >2000 m.

Using the parasite-host system between the parasitic nematode Contracaecum osculatum and the Eastern Baltic cod Gadus morhua, we here shed new light on how parasite load may relate to the physiological condition of a transport host. The Eastern Baltic cod is in distress, with declining nutritional conditions, disappearance of the larger fish, high natural mortality and no signs of recovery of the population. During the latest decade, high infection levels with C. osculatum have been observed in fish in the central and southern parts of the Baltic Sea. We investigated the aerobic performance, nutritional condition, organ masses, and plasma and proximate body composition of wild naturally infected G. morhua in relation to infection density with C. osculatum. Fish with high infection densities of C. osculatum had (i) decreased nutritional condition, (ii) depressed energy turnover as evidenced by reduced standard metabolic rate, (iii) reduction in the digestive organ masses, and alongside (iv) changes in the plasma, body and liver composition, and fish energy source. The significantly reduced albumin to globulin ratio in highly infected G. morhua suggests that the fish suffer from a chronic liver disease. Furthermore, fish with high infection loads had the lowest Fulton's condition factor. Yet, it remains unknown whether our results steam from a direct effect of C. osculatum, or because G. morhua in an already compromised nutritional state are more susceptible towards the parasite. Nevertheless, impairment of the physiological condition can lead to reduced swimming performance, compromising foraging success while augmenting the risk of predation, potentially leading to an increase in the natural mortality of the host. We hence argue that fish-parasite interactions must not be neglected when implementing and refining strategies to rebuild deteriorating populations. ¬© 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

During the last century, the main research focus has been on the spatio-temporal match of larval fish and appropriate food (bottom-up processes). However, these field studies are often criticised for their limited capability to disentangle their results from mortality caused by predation since these top-down mechanisms are rarely studied. We examined the predation on herring (Clupea harengus) larvae in a Baltic inshore lagoon by investigating the spatio-temporal overlap of larval herring and their potential predators such as the dominant threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in distinct habitats (sublittoral and littoral areas) using a set of different gears and sampling techniques. Despite significant spatial and temporal predator-prey overlap, stomach analyses suggested that very few larvae were consumed by sticklebacks, even if projected to the entire study area and season. Other well-known predators of clupeid larvae such as gelatinous plankton occur later in the year after young herring have migrated out of the system. The observed predation on herring larvae was much less than expected and appears being a minor factor in determining herring reproduction success in our study area, particularly if compared to other causes of mortality such as egg predation. Providing a relatively good shelter from predation might be a key element making transitional waters valuable nursery grounds for the offspring of migrating marine fish species. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,,Scopus,K,Baltic Sea - CS,"5,000-10,000",year,"5,000-10,000",year,Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey,NA,2,2,2,NA,NA,Clupea harengus,"early life stages (eggs, larvae)",Predator pressure,Reproduction,Predation rate,No response,NA,NA,PREDATOR

In contrast to fully marine waters, the Baltic Sea is stratified by a salinity gradient that strongly affects fish physiology, distribution, diversity and virulence of important marine pathogens. Animals thus face the challenge to simultaneously adapt to the concurrent salinity and cope with the selection imposed by the changing pathogenic virulence. Western Baltic spring-spawning herring (Clupea harengus) migrate to spawning grounds characterized by different salinities to which herring are supposedly adapted. We hypothesized that herring populations do not only have to cope with different salinity levels but that they are simultaneously exposed to higher-order effects that accompany the shifts in salinity, that is induced pathogenicity of Vibrio bacteria in lower saline waters. To experimentally evaluate this, adults of two populations were caught in their spawning grounds and fully reciprocally crossed within and between populations. Larvae were reared at three salinity levels, representing the spawning ground salinity of each of the two populations, or Atlantic salinity conditions resembling the phylogenetic origin of Clupea harengus. In addition, larvae were exposed to a Vibrio spp. infection. Life-history traits and gene expression analysis served as response variables. Herring seem adapted to Baltic Sea conditions and cope better with low saline waters. However, upon a bacterial infection, herring larvae suffer more when kept at lower salinities implying reduced resistance against Vibrio or higher Vibrio virulence. In the context of recent climate change with less saline marine waters in the Baltic Sea, such interactions may constitute key future stressors. ¬© 2017 The Authors.

Survival was also found to be positively correlated with dissolved oxygen levels and regionally related to shifts in salinity. These relationships were further studied in context to the potential predation on post-smolts by one of the main piscivores in the Baltic, Eastern Baltic cod (Gadus morhua callarias). Concomitant with changes in environmental conditions, Baltic cod has changed its latitudinal range, moving northward in the Baltic, possibly in response to warming conditions. These changes lead us to hypothesize that predation pressure on salmon may have increased in recent years as cod has now occupied habitats used by salmon post-smolts during their southward feeding migrations. This predation may have been intensified as a result of anoxic conditions in the central basin by concentrating predation interactions in coastal waters and/or the upper water column typically occupied by salmon post-smolts. Indicators of post-smolt growth were applied to test the alternate hypothesis that mortality is growth-mediated; these indicators lacked a time series trend, which supports the contention that shifting predation pressure rather than feeding opportunities is responsible for the decline in post-smolt survival in Baltic salmon. ¬© Published by International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2016.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,K,Baltic Sea - CS,">100,000",year,">100,000",year,Mark Recapture,Correlation,2,2,2,NA,NA,Salmo salar,"early life stages (eggs, larvae)",Temperature,Survival,Survivors,Overall positive response,NA,NA,TEMPERATURE

Marine survival estimates were found to be negatively correlated with temperature, indicating that warming conditions have not favoured survival. Survival was also found to be positively correlated with dissolved oxygen levels and regionally related to shifts in salinity.

During spring when biological reproductive processes begin in the temperate zones, regional climate variability can be immense and uncovering a non-linear biological response, such as fish recruitment to changing temperature regimes might be challenging. Using herring as a paradigm for a response of coastal spring productivity to regional climate drivers, we demonstrated how the annual timing of spawning periods can significantly affect the reproductive success of spring-spawning herring (Clupea harengus) in the western Baltic Sea. An investigation of spawning phenology in consecutive years indicated a temperature threshold range of 3.5‚Äì4.5¬∞C triggering initial spawning in the coastal zone. Based on this finding, we analyzed the timing of larval hatching peaks, larval survival and recruitment to the adult population relative to multi-decadal time-series of seasonal sea-surface temperatures. The results revealed that the late seasonal onset of cold periods the corresponding elongation of the period where larvae hatch from the eggs and early larval hatching peaks significantly reduced larval production in a coastal nursery area and finally lead to a reduced abundance of juveniles in the entire distribution area. Using a combination of field research and time series analysis, we presented precedence for shifting regional winter regimes providing a present-day stressor to reproductive capacity of a central component of the coastal food web. ¬© Copyright ¬© 2021 Polte, Gr√∂hsler, Kotterba, von Nordheim, Moll, Santos, Rodriguez-Tress, Zablotski and Zimmermann.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,K,Baltic Sea - CS,">100,000",year,">100,000",year,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey,Correlation,2,2,2,NA,NA,Clupea harengus,NA,Temperature,Survival,Survivors,Overall negative response,NA,NA,TEMPERATURE

Here, we used different techniques, such as centre of gravity, distance, and homogeneity indices, to better characterize the spatial and temporal variations in sprat density and body condition in the Baltic Proper. Our results evidenced a negative spatio-temporal co-variation between the centres of gravity of density and maximum condition. In the 1980s-early 1990s both centres were located in the middle of the Baltic Proper. From the mid 1990s the centres progressively separated in space, as the sprat population moved towards the north-eastern Baltic Proper, and the centre of maximum condition towards the south-western areas. Moreover, at low abundances, sprat density and condition were homogeneously distributed in space, whereas at high abundances both density and condition showed pronounced geographical gradients. The ecological processes potentially explaining the observed patterns were discussed in the light of the Ideal Free Distribution theory. We provide evidence that the shift in the spatial distribution of cod, the main predator of sprat, has been the main factor triggering the overall spatial changes in sprat density, and thus condition, during the past thirty years.

The aim of this work was to investigate the growth responses of sea trout to changing temperature conditions and to compare the growth plasticity between wild and hatchery-reared fish. Scales were collected from sea trout in a selected river flowing into the southern Baltic Sea. We analyzed the scale increment widths as a proxy of somatic growth and investigated the interannual variabilities and differences in growth between fish groups (wild and hatchery-reared). We used mixed-effects Bayesian modeling and ascribed the variances in growth to different sources. Furthermore, we developed indices of interannual (2003‚Äì2015) growth variation in the marine and freshwater phases of the life cycle of the fish and analyzed the relationships between trout growth and temperature. Temperature positively affects fish growth, regardless of the origin of the fish. We observed stronger relationships between fish growth and temperature conditions in the marine phase than in the freshwater phase. Additionally, wild sea trout are characterized by stronger responses to temperature variability and higher phenotypic plasticity of growth than those of the hatchery-reared individuals. Therefore, wild sea trout might be better suited to changing environmental conditions than hatchery-reared sea trout.

This finding is useful for multispecies modelling of the Baltic fish stocks, and also supports the hypothesis that hydrographic conditions play a dominant role in the recruitment success of cod.

This was caused by a decline in the cod stock, due to recruitment failure and high fishing intensity, resulting in a decrease in predation pressure on sprat. Concurrently with the lowest cod stock size on record, sprat reached biomass values of above 2 x 106 t in 1992, being relatively stable afterwards. Besides predation mortality through cod and in recent years also an increasing fishing pressure, cannibalism on eggs may be a compensatory process limiting the reproductive success of sprat and hence contributing to the population regulation in the Central Baltic. Based on sprat stomach sampling on 21 cruises between March 1988 and July 1996 cannibalism on sprat eggs was investigated in the Bornholm Basin, one of the main spawning areas of Central Baltic sprat. Using a model of gastric evacuation to estimate daily food intake rates and a Virtual Population/Extended Survivor Analysis for computing predator population sizes, egg cannibalism rates were estimated. These were compared to egg abundance data from ichthyoplankton surveys and to preliminary estimates of seasonal egg productions. The study revealed significant interannual differences in the intensity of sprat egg cannibalism with considerable predation in 1990 to 1992 (&gt;15 % of the egg abundance during peak spawning and &gt;60% of the seasonal production) and a reduction in most recent years (&lt;16% of the corresponding abundance and production).

Other fish, including cod, form only a small part of their diet. To examine the frequency of cannibalism in the Central Baltic, stomach data were analysed for 1963-1990. During this period, cod in cod stomachs in the Gotland Basin constituted 2.8% by weight of the total food content, while the frequency of occurrence was 1.1%. Cannibalism was recorded mainly in cod >35 cm, and the size range of cod found in stomachs was 5-15 cm. Cannibalism was observed in restricted areas only and varied strongly between years. The intensity of predation on cod was significantly different between the periods 1969-1975, 1976-1979, and 1980-1990. Until 1980, the population in the eastern part mainly inhabited near-bottom layers. Higher abundance of recruits and their wide distribution raised the level of cannibalism. Development of stagnation during the 1980s resulted in the reduction of recruitment and stock size. The distribution of the adult population changed from near-bottom to mid-water during the first half of the year. The low abundance of small cod and the differences in distribution between small and large fish appear to have been the major factors determining very low predation on cod during 1980-90. Overall, the influence of cod cannibalism on recruitment success is negligible in the Central Baltic. Stock dynamics in the area are determined by the combined effects of variable oceanographic conditions and the fishery.

Here we evaluate whether an existing recruitment model for the year classes 1973-1999 can forecast recruitment for five new year classes. The coefficient of variation (CV) of predictions was 5%, and four of five new year classes were within 95% confidence limits of predictions made by the earlier model. We then assimilated climatic, oceanographic, and recruitment linkages and their uncertainty into the standard International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) assessment procedure to predict key advisory-related variables such as spawning stock biomass (SSB) and landings. These linkages enable a forecast of recruitment earlier than the annual assessment meeting. Forecasts made using the North Atlantic Oscillation to predict the 2006 year class showed that spawner biomass would be 15% lower than spawner biomass calculated using the ICES standard methodology. The difference in perception of future biomass does not affect the advice for the stock because the spawning stock biomass is greater than the critical biomass limit (SSB &gt; BPA).

Mortality and injuries have been observed in fish exposed to loud impulse sounds, but knowledge on the sound levels at which (sub-)lethal effects occur is limited for juvenile and adult fish, and virtually non-existent for fish eggs and larvae. A device was developed in which fish larvae can be exposed to underwater sound. It consists of a rigid-walled cylindrical chamber driven by an electro-dynamical sound projector. Samples of up to 100 larvae can be exposed simultaneously to a homogeneously distributed sound pressure and particle velocity field. Recorded pile-driving sounds could be reproduced accurately in the frequency range between 50 and 1000 Hz, at zero to peak pressure levels up to 210 dB re 1ŒºPa 2 (zero to peak pressures up to 32 kPa) and single pulse sound exposure levels up to 186 dB re 1ŒºPa 2s. The device was used to examine lethal effects of sound exposure in common sole (Solea solea) larvae. Different developmental stages were exposed to various levels and durations of pile-driving sound. The highest cumulative sound exposure level applied was 206 dB re 1ŒºPa 2s, which corresponds to 100 strikes at a distance of 100 m from a typical North Sea pile-driving site. The results showed no statistically significant differences in mortality between exposure and control groups at sound exposure levels which were well above the US interim criteria for non-auditory tissue damage in fish. Although our findings cannot be extrapolated to fish larvae in general, as interspecific differences in vulnerability to sound exposure may occur, they do indicate that previous assumptions and criteria may need to be revised. ¬© 2012 Bolle et al.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,K,North Sea - CS,0-5,two week,">100,000",Not specified,Larvae collected from fish farm,GLMM,1,2,3,NA,NA,Solea solea,Larvae,Sound,Survival,Underwater sound due to pile driving,NA,No response,Not significant,ABIOTIC ANTHROPIC

According to ideal free distribution theory, populations contract into areas of highest habitat suitability as their abundance decreases. This can increase their vulnerability to fishing and predation. We detected density-dependent habitat selection by juvenile Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) (ages 1 and 2) in the North Sea and compared the observed distribution-abundance relationships with those predicted from a model based on ideal free distribution theory and knowledge of optimal temperatures for growth, where temperature was used as a measure of suitability. As predicted by the model, in years when stock size was low, the catches were largely confined to regions with near-optimal bottom temperatures. Conversely, when population size was high, catches were spread across a larger area including regions with suboptimal temperatures. The spatial extent of optimal habitat appears to have decreased from 1977 to 2002, reflecting a gradual warming of the North Sea. The combined negative effects of increased temperature on recruitment rates and the reduced availability of optimal habitat may have increased the vulnerability of the cod population to fishing mortality. ¬© 2005 NRC.",English,Article,,Scopus,K,North Sea - CS,">100,000",multidecadal,">100,000",10 months,Bottom trawl,Spearman rank correlation,2,2,3,NA,NA,Gadus morhua,Juvenile,Density dependence,Abundance,NA,Optimal-type response,Significant,NA,COMPETITION & DENSITY DEPENDENCE

A reduction in the spawning stock biomass of herring may release jellyfish from competition for prey with herring and exacerbate any impact by jellyfish on herring survival. Both jellyfish abundance and the spawning success of herring fluctuate from year to year and increase under similar environmental conditions. The abundance of medusae (diameter = 1 to 47 cm, June to August) at herring spawning areas in the North Sea was correlated positively with the abundance of recently hatched herring larvae (&lt;1 cm, sampled 1 to 15 September 1971 to 1986), and this concurrence heightens the potential for competition. A significant negative relationship (p &lt; 0.05) between the survival of herring to Age 0 and the abundance of the scyphozoan Aurelia aurita implies that this jellyfish might adversely impact the North Sea herring population. Furthermore, regression analyses suggest that climate variability may mediate the possible impact by A. aurita on herring survival and 0-group recruitment through changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation Index and the abundance of the scyphozoan Cyanea capillata (r2 &gt; 0.60, p &lt; 0.05). Management of North Sea herring may benefit from the inclusion of predation and competition effects of medusae into forecasting models of herring recruitment. ¬© Inter-Research 2005.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,K,North Sea - CS,">100,000",multidecadal,">100,000",10 months,Pelagic trawl,Pearson correlation coefficient,2,2,3,NA,NA,Clupea harengus,Larvae,Competition,Survival,NA,Overall negative response,Significant,Significant negative relationship between abundance of competing jellyfish and herring larvae abundance,COMPETITION & DENSITY DEPENDENCE

In these years extremely high numbers of individuals settled, yet the population sizes in July were similar to other years. Thus the nursery ground processes were likely to be density dependent. Shrimp and crab densities were low in Port Erin Bay and probably had little predatory impact on young plaice. Crustacean densities were not significantly related to winter temperatures.

Two Atlantic copepod species, Metridia lucens and Candacia armata, showed a simultaneous increase in the years when spawning herring returned to Aberdeen Bank. During the late 1960s, both species declined at the time when the spawning population on Aberdeen Bank disappeared. Earlier work has demonstrated that an increased Atlantic inflow results in a southward displacement of plankton concentrations and feeding herring in the northwestern North Sea. I hypothesize that such a southern distribution of the herring stock, caused indirectly by the increased Atlantic inflow, influenced recruit spawners to choose the nearby Aberdeen Bank as their spawning ground in 1983. Fluctuations of the spawning populations in the northern North Sea during earlier decades are explained by switches of recruitment between the northern and southern population, as a result of variations in latitudinal distribution of the recruiting year-class.",English,Article,,Scopus,K,North Sea - CS,">100,000",multidecadal,">100,000",5 years,ICES fishery data,Comparison of time series indices of larvae and plankton abundances,2,2,3,NA,NA,Clupea harengus,Larvae,Plankton,Reproduction,NA,Overall positive response,Significant,Appearance of spawning populations follows trends of plankton abundances,FOOD

However, on the Galician coast a drastic decline of 16¬†cm from 1980 to 1988 was followed by a rapid increase in size at maturity during the next 10¬†years to original values and a stable period in the last 6¬†years. Decreasing biomass may explain the decline in size at maturity in the first period. However, total biomass and spawning biomass declined even during the period when size at maturity increased, which is contrary to compensatory theory. Shifts in environmental regime, NAO and upwelling, may have contributed to a decelerated growth during this period that might explain the later maturation. ¬© 2007 Elsevier B.V.

It shows that this herring stock has had large fluctuations during the last century; these fluctuations have mainly been determined by variations in the temperature of the inflowing water masses to the region. The spawning stock biomass (SSB) increased from a rather low level in the early years of this century and reached a high level of around 14 million tons by 1930. The spawning stock biomass then decreased to a level of around 10 million tons by 1940, but increased again to a record high level of 16 million tons by 1945. The stock then started to decrease and during the next 20-year period fell to a level of less than 50 000 tons by the late 1960s. Through the 1970s and 1980s, the stock slowly recovered and after the recruitment of strong year classes in 1983 and 1990-1992 the stock recovered to a spawning stock biomass of about 10 million tons. The long-term fluctuation in spawning stock biomass is caused by variations in the survival of recruits. It is found that the long-term changes in spawning stock abundance are highly correlated with the long-term variations in the mean annual temperature of the inflowing Atlantic water masses (through the Kola section) into the north-east Atlantic region. The recruitment is positively correlated with the average temperature in the Kola section in the winter months, January April, which indicates that environmental factors govern the large-scale fluctuations in production for this herring stock.",English,Article,,Web of Science,K,Global,">100,000",multidecadal,">100,000",Not specified,Fishery statistic data,Linear regression analysis,1,2,3,NA,NA,Clupea harengus,Recruits,Temperature,Abundance,SSB abundance,Overall positive response,Significant,p-value <0.01,TEMPERATURE

Probabilistic maturation reaction norms to study changes in age-specific size at maturation. Decomposition of trait variation into ecological and evolutionary contributions. Conclusions: Our evolutionary ecosystem perspective shows that both ecological and evolutionary processes are important contributors to observed phenotypic changes in this commercially exploited species. Around 60% of the decrease in age-specific body length can be attributed to increased density-dependent body growth. Evolutionary changes towards earlier maturation, owing to an indirect effect of size-selective mortality from grey seals and fisheries, account for a further 25% of the decrease in age-specific body size. ¬© 2014 √ñrjan √ñstman.",English,Article,,Scopus,K,Baltic Sea - CS,">100,000",multidecadal,">100,000",NA,Mid-water trawl _ near-bottom trawl,GLM,2,2,3,NA,NA,Clupea harengus,All stages,Plankton,Growth,NA,Overall positive response,Significant,NA,FOOD

This syndrome is believed to be the result of a combined environmental load of anthropogenic substances like chloroorganic pollutants and their metabolites. The syndrome is so far only found in Baltic salmon spending their post-smolt period in the Baltic Sea. COPs were significantly higher (P = 0.0289) in Baltic salmon eggs suffering from M74 than in healthy eggs, while no difference was found between healthy Baltic salmon eggs and those from the Atlantic stock (p>0.05).

More detailed information on spatial, decadal and seasonal growth variations is provided for the Iberian-Biscay region using data collected in acoustic surveys since the mid-1980s. Growth curves are fitted to annual or monthly length-at-age data using a robust Von Bertalanffy model; parameters for recent samples are compared with literature information using an auximetric plot while differences between areas within the Iberian-Biscay region are tested by log-likelihood ratio tests. Sardine growth performance is generally lower in the Mediterranean and declines across the northeastern Atlantic from the English Channel to north Morocco but increases sharply off Mauritania. Lower growth of Mediterranean sardines is possibly associated to the overall oligotrophy of this Sea while differentiation from the Atlantic is likely sustained by reproductive isolation between populations from the two areas. Within the northeastern Atlantic, size- and age related migrations may partly explain differences in maximum length/age and mean length-at-age between neighbouring areas but the broad-scale latitudinal decline in growth is consistent with adaptation to the north-south decline in seasonal temperature gradients and to the annual cycles of plankton production. Within the Atlantic Iberian waters, sardine grows and improves in condition during spring and summer when the allocation of energetic resources for gonad development cease, temperature is close to the annual maxima and plankton production is high. Variation in sardine length-at-age and growth within the Atlanto-Iberian stock area has implications for stock structure and needs to be taken into account in the calculation of weight and maturity-at-age for assessment purposes.

A strong increase in the consumption of herring eggs by sticklebacks was observed between 11¬∞C and 15¬∞C (Q10 = 3.15). Additionally, we found a significant positive correlation between egg concentration per area and predation intensity.

We used a method that combined particle tracking models and survey data to estimate survival, and microscopic examination of gut contents of archived samples of larvae collected in February each year between 1995 and 2007 to investigate parasite prevalence and feeding. We deduced that we can use the incidence of tetraphyllidean parasites as an index of the cumulative feeding history of the larval population. We found that the prevalence of larvae of a tetraphyllidean cestode in the gut contents varied significantly between years and was positively correlated with feeding success. High feeding success, indicated by high prevalence of tetraphyllideans, influenced survival by offsetting the effect of a second parasite type, a digenean trematode.

Patches of old larvae were found around the French and Cantabrian shelf (CS) edges and even in oceanic waters, far from the main spawning areas, whereas the youngest larvae appeared in the middle French shelf, associated with adult spawning locations. The analysis of environmental conditions showed significant differences from coastal to oceanic stations as well as in areas under the influence of river discharges. A principal component analysis carried out on temperature, stratification, chlorophyll a and plankton concentration distinguished five areas: Gironde, Northern French Shelf, Southern French Shelf, CS and Oceanic area. Growth and mortality rates were estimated for anchovy larvae in these contrasting areas. Advective processes due to dominant north-easterly winds during summer influence larval distribution in the Bay of Biscay after spawning. However higher food concentration on the shelf did not result in significant differences in the growth rate. Mortality rates seem to be negatively related to larval size, although this effect may be partially due to advection.

To date 59 bass have been recaptured, 86 % by anglers, 12 % by commercial fishermen and 2 % by research vessels. Forty-seven bass were recaptured within 16 km of their release point. Of the 12 bass recaptured at a greater distance, four were taken within 90 days and had moved by an average of 1.4 km/day. From the tag returns and the length distributions of the bass tagged by areas it is concluded that bass form permanent populations in estuaries until they are 2‚Äì3 years old, when they move offshore, eventually becoming very mobile as evidenced by the long-distance movements observed. Instantaneous fishing mortality rates, estimated from the rate of tag returns, were between 0.16 and 0.22 (15-20% a year) for bass populations in estuaries and 0.09-0.18 (9‚Äì16 % a year) for those offshore, with the lower value being the most probable for the offshore population. Calculation of yield curves showed that at these levels of fishing mortality the maximum sustainable yield per recruit is being obtained. Raising the effective age of recruitment to at least 6 years would give a higher yield per recruit, which would be less sensitive to variations in the fishing mortality rate, and increase the average weight of fish in the catch. Using the fishing mortality rates and published age composition data estimates of relative year-class size since 1945 were made. They showed that recruitment has declined by 64‚Äì76 % between the two periods 1945‚Äì9 and 1958‚Äì62, the last 5-year period for which data are available. There are considerable variations in year-class size, which appear to be related to high sea temperatures and low wind speeds from a southerly direction from May to September. Results from other bass tagging experiments are discussed and it is concluded that deductions made from other experiments, that bass form localized populations, have resulted from tagging taking place into areas where bass are most abundant and where fishing intensity is highest. It is concluded that there is a single stock of bass in British waters.

In the case of European anchovy in the Bay of Biscay, major mortality events take place during spring and summer, and thus, the juvenile population in autumn is considered as an indicator of the next year recruitment. However, overwinter mortality could be an additional process regulating anchovy recruitment success in this area. Anchovy juveniles winter mortality was estimated over eleven years, between 2003 and 2013, using acoustic estimates of juvenile abundance (in autumn) and age-1 adults (the following spring) from two independent surveys. The results show that mortality is highly variable among years, with values ranging between 0.004 and 0.016 d‚àí1. Size- and density-dependent mortality were also evaluated during the analysis. Observed size distributions of juveniles in autumn were projected to the following spring assuming different size specific growth rate distributions in the population. Thereafter, the projected size frequency distributions were compared with the observed ones. The results indicate that mortality is higher for small individuals in most of the years (7 of 11). The mortality rate is positively correlated with juvenile abundance in autumn but not with mean juvenile length. The results suggest that although a density-dependent effect could be one of the main factors regulating the survival of juveniles during winter, size-dependent mortality could also impact recruitment. Understanding the factors that trigger size-dependent mortality during winter could contribute to the management of this fishery. ¬© 2019 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,NA,Scopus,K,Western Waters - CS,">100,000",decade,NA,year,"Active Acoustuc Sampling Survey, Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey",NA,2,2,don't know,NA,NA,Engraulis encrasicolus,juveniles,Density dependence,Survival,NA,overall positive,significant,"winter mortality was density-dependent, with mortality increasing at higher abundances",COMPETITION & DENSITY DEPENDENCE

In this apparently shifting environment, the conditions of herring and sprat have undergone large inter-annual variations during the past 15-20 years. In this study, we explore how abiotic factors (i.e. salinity and temperature) and biotic factors (biomass of the copepods Pseudocalanus elongatus, Temora longicornis, Acartia spp. and of cladocerans as well as clupeid abundance) in different seasons (May and August) affect clupeid body condition.

The strong correlation between clupeid abundance and total zooplankton biomass points to food competition and to top-down control by herring and sprat on common food resources.

A broad screening approach was taken, using conventional methods for isolating and identifying fungi, bacteria, and viruses. Bacteria were identified using specific sequences of 16S rRNA, and microbe identification based on the analysis of differences between 2 complex genomes using a DNA subtractive methodology; representation difference analysis (RDA). The selection of tissue sites to be isolated was based on histopathological findings. Bartonella spp., which are known to be associated with inflammatory cardiac diseases in other animals, were not found to be associated with coronary arterial lesions in sea-run Baltic salmon. During the long starvation period during spawning migration, essential substances such as vitamins may be provided by the salmon's symbiotic intestinal micro flora. From the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of adult sea-run Baltic salmon, we were able to isolate Aeromonas sobria, Pseudomonas putrefaciens, Pseudomonas spp., A. hydrophila and Hafnia alvei, all of which can produce vitamin B2. P. putrefaciens and Pseudomonas spp. isolated from the GI tract also produce small amounts of Vitamin B3. Furthermore, it was found that chemotheraputic treatment of spawning salmon with formalin seems to disturb the symbiotic GI-flora. Upon completion of the present investigations we should be able to conclude whether or not M74 is due to anthropogenic disturbances, caused by chemotherapeutic agents or other anthropogenic pollutants in the environment, which compromise maternal health and lead to the activation of a pathogen or the disruption of vitamin production by symbionts.",English,Article,,Scopus,K,Baltic Sea - non CS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Conventional methods for isolating microbes_Sequences 16S RNA_DNA substractive methodology_Representation difference analysis,2,2,3,Routine microbiological screening methods did not reveal the association of any pathogenic microorganism with the M74 disease syndrome,NA,Salmo salar,"early life stages (eggs, larvae)",Parasite,Survival,M74 fry mortality syndrome,No response,Large,NA,BIOTIC

Egg densities varied between locations, years, and spawnings. Egg size and mortality were dependent on the spawning time. In the early spawnings, eggs were larger than in the late ones. Egg mortality was < 10% in May but increased significantly in June. Temperature, spawning depth, and substratum type partly accounted for the mortality. Perch (Perea √üuviatilis) was the most important predator of eggs and invertebrate predation was found to be negligible.

However, population studies often use spatially aggregated data to draw inferences about population trends and drivers, potentially masking ecologically relevant population sub-structure and dynamics. The goals of this study were to investigate how population dynamics models with and without spatial structure affect inferences on population trends and the identification of intrinsic drivers of population dynamics (e.g. density dependence). Specifically, we developed dynamic, age-structured, state-space models to test different hypotheses regarding the spatial structure of a population complex of coastal Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Data were from a 93-year survey of juvenile (age 0 and 1) cod sampled along >200¬†km of the Norwegian Skagerrak coast. We compared two models: one which assumes all sampled cod belong to one larger population, and a second which assumes that each fjord contains a unique population with locally determined dynamics. Using the best supported model, we then reconstructed the historical spatial and temporal dynamics of Skagerrak coastal cod. Cross-validation showed that the spatially structured model with local dynamics had better predictive ability. Furthermore, posterior predictive checks showed that a model which assumes one homogeneous population failed to capture the spatial correlation pattern present in the survey data. The spatially structured model indicated that population trends differed markedly among fjords, as did estimates of population parameters including density-dependent survival. Recent biomass was estimated to be at a near-record low all along the coast, but the finer scale model indicated that the decline occurred at different times in different regions. Warm temperatures were associated with poor recruitment, but local changes in habitat and fishing pressure may have played a role in driving local dynamics. More generally, we demonstrated how state-space models can be used to test evidence for population spatial structure based on survey time-series data. Our study shows the importance of considering spatially structured dynamics, as the inferences from such an approach can lead to a different ecological understanding of the drivers of population declines, and fundamentally different management actions to restore populations. ¬© 2017 The Authors.

The main trophic interactions between dominant groundfish populations in this region involve walleye pollock as prey. A multispecies virtual population analysis model (MSVPA) covering the period 1979ñ1995 has been parameterized for the eastern Bering Sea in order to move closer to providing multispecies management advice for this region. The MSVPA model is based on extensive diet data from 70 predator/prey/year/quarter combinations and currently includes the following species as predators: walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), Greenland turbot (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), yellowfin sole (Pleuronectes asper), arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias), and northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus). Arrowtooth flounder and northern fur seals are entered as ìother predatorsî, which means that population and mortality estimates are not directly made for these species. Estimates of their consumption rates, diet, and population abundance are input, however, so that their predation on prey species in the model can be calculated. Prey species are walleye pollock, Pacific cod, Greenland turbot, yellowfin sole, rock sole (Lepidopsetta bilineatus), and Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi). Results show that large numbers of walleye pollock, particularly age-0 and age-1 fish, are consumed and cannibalism by adult pollock constitutes the largest source of predation mortality for age-0 fish. Predation plays an important role in explaining the recruitment dynamics of pollock.

The influence of some environmental variables (sea surface temperature, wind speed, NAO index) and some fishing effort indices (fishing days, mean size and mean engine power of the trawl vessels) was analysed as well. The species considered for the study were Eledone cirrhosa, Merluccius merluccius, Mullus barbatus, Nephrops norvegicus and Parapenaeus longirostris. From 1991 to 2006, the mean monthly landing rates were computed from the data collected at the auction of Porto Santo Stefano, the most important fishing harbour in the area.A second data set was represented by trawl survey data: two experimental trawl surveys per year have been carried out in the framework of national and international programs on the assessment of demersal resources.

Spatio-temporal variation of abundance and condition of fish were evaluated at two locations each with different oceanographic conditions, one in the north (S√≥ller, SO) and another in the south (Cabrera, CA) of Mallorca Island. Environmental variables explored were hydrography, sediment characteristics, phytoplankton pigment concentration (ppc) and the trophic resources of hake. Individuals were divided in three life stages: recruits, post-recruits and young adults. Hepatosomatic index (HSI), relative condition index (Kn), gonadosomatic index (GSI) and fullness index (FI) were analysed for the three life stages. Recruitment starts in February with the incorporation of smaller hakes, and it can be followed through spring and early summer with a peak in April. However, some spatial heterogeneity in the recruitment process has been found between north and south of the Island. The main pulse of recruitment occurred at a different time in the two areas. Spatial heterogeneity was also consistent with the condition of hake recruits, with higher values of Kn and HSI at SO than at CA. Maximum values of Kn were found in February at SO and in April at CA, coinciding with the start of the different recruitment pulses to the fishing grounds. Post-recruits and young adults also showed higher condition at SO than at CA. The arrival in spring of the Western Winter Intermediate Waters (WIW) drives the spatial-temporal variation in abundance and condition of hake. Ppc was highly correlated with recruit abundance with a time lag of two months, while for post-recruits the time lag was three months. The observed differences in the condition of hake between areas could be a consequence of the fact that the waters to the north of Mallorca are comparatively more under the seasonal influence of WIW which is formed in more productive areas. Thus, this study characterises the short temporal and spatial variability in the hake recruitment process off the Balearic Islands, both in terms of abundance and fish condition. This pattern is explained on the basis of the mesoscale environmental variability observed between north and south of Mallorca and the ecological adaptive strategy of recruiting in the optimal environmental season. ¬© 2007 Elsevier B.V.

However, the most recurrent inter-annual pattern was a negative effect of size on survival, which could be attributed to potential ontogenetic changes in catchability and underrepresentation of intra-annual recruitment pulses that are seasonally inaccessible to the MEDITS survey. Results also evidence that survival in the Alboran and Adriatic seas is dependent on the primary production variability, and that Corsica and Sardinia could be potential feeding grounds receiving juveniles from neighbouring areas. The present study reveals the importance of size-and growth-dependent survival in the juvenile stage of European hake in the Mediterranean Sea. ¬© 2019 CSIC.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,K,Mediterranean - CS,">100,000",multidecadal,">100,000",NA,Standard Fisheries Survey,GLMs,2,2,3,NA,NA,Merluccius merluccius,juveniles,Plankton,Survival,chlorophyl,Mixed response,Small,NA,FOOD

Parapenaeus longirostris) was analysed along the western coasts of Italy (North Tyrrhenian-Ligurian Sea: Geographical Sub-Area 9). This crustacean is currently one of the most important commercial species of the trawl fisheries in the Mediterranean Sea. Landings of the species in the North Tyrrhenian-Ligurian Sea have grown consistently during the last years following a rapid increase in the stock size. Since the deep-sea pink shrimp stock is exploited on the same fishing ground of other heavily overexploited stocks in a full mixed and poorly selective fishery, its condition seems to be largely independent of the current fishing exploitation pattern suggesting a positive role of climate change on the dynamic of the stock.To test this hypothesis we investigated the effect of sea surface temperature (SST) on density and distribution of P. longirostris by means of general additive models (GAMs). Two different models were developed for the whole stock and for the recruits (CL&lt;20mm) using time series of MEDITS (International bottom trawl survey in the Mediterranean) survey density indices (n km-2) covering the period 1995-2010. Predictors included were geographical coordinates, quarterly averaged minimum SST, sampling depth and year. Spawners density was included as predictor into the GAM for recruits.The best GAM for the whole stock explained 67.1% of the total deviance, showing a clear increase in density in concomitance with the expansion of the stock northward. We found a significant positive effect of the min SST of all seasons, as expected considering that P. longirostris spawn all year round, with the highest influence played by summer min SST, either in the same or previous year.The best model for recruits explained 64.9% of the total deviance. Recruitment increased linearly with the density of spawners showing a positive temporal trend and an expansion northward. The observed trend in recruitment appeared significantly linked to minimum SST in summer and during the autumn of the previous year, with a positive effect on shrimp density over 23.5. ¬∞C and 14. ¬∞C respectively. The climate-related changes in recruitment appeared to be the key process driving the dynamics of the stock, involving either higher production or survival in the planktonic stages, or owing to changes in the quality/quantity of nursery habitats. ¬© 2013 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,NA,Scopus,K,Mediterranean - CS,"10,000-50,000",decade,"10,000-50,000",NA,Standard Fisheries Survey,GAMs,2,2,3,NA,NA,Parapenaeus longirostris,NA,Temperature,Reproduction,NA,Overall positive,Medium,NA,TEMPERATURE

The inverse relationship between the stage of ovarian development and temperature in A. marinus is in contrast with that seen in many early year spawners. A close relationship between relative ovary size and ovarian development, as well as an overlap in oocyte diameter among treatments suggested that this temperature effect is mediated via an energetic constraint on reproductive investment. Temperature had no effect on the potential fecundity‚Äîlength relationship in December, and while the intensity of pre-ovulatory atresia did not reflect condition, it was found to increase with temperature and decrease with oocyte diameter.

In this study, we document the temporal and spatial changes in one remarkable example of stock recovery: northern European hake (Merluccius merluccius). Analysing data from several scientific surveys, we document a dramatic increase in estimates of biomass between 2004 and 2011 throughout the larger area now occupied by the stock. The largest increase occurred in the North Sea, where hake have been largely absent for over 50 years. Spatio-temporally resolved commercial landings show that high densities occur in the North Sea only between April and September, suggesting a density-dependent seasonal habitat expansion to suitable temperature and depth conditions. These changes have implications for the management of the stock which are discussed. Notably, if discards are banned as part of management revisions, the relatively low quota for hake in the North Sea will be a limiting factor (the so-called 'choke' species) which may result in a premature closure of the entire demersal mixed fishery in the North Sea, jeopardizing many commercial fisheries in the region.

Herring (Clupea harengus) has been suggested to be a major predator on fish larvae in the North Sea. We investigated possible interactions between herring and Norway pout using a simple statistical analysis and a modified stock-recruit relationship. There was a significant negative relationship (linear regression, r = -0.44, p &lt; 0.05) between total herring biomass and recruitment of Norway pout. The spawning stock of Norway pout is typically dominated by 2-year-olds, and there was a strong negative relationship (linear regression, r = -0.79, p &lt; 0.01) between herring biomass and Norway pout spawning-stock biomass (SSB) 2 years later. A Beverton-Holt model fitted to stock-recruit data of Norway pout produced a rather poor correlation (r2 = 0.04). However, when only the Norway pout SSB not overlapping with herring is considered, the fit between the model and the stock-recruit data improves (r2 = 0.31).

This study addresses the hypothesis that the abundance of settled O-group plaice along the Danish coast of the Kattegat depends on transport from the Skagerrak. Abundance data are derived from annual (1957-1994; 10-15 years missing depending on sample site) juvenile fish surveys conducted at four sites by the Danish Institute for Fisheries Research. The O-group abundance measured in July-August is significantly higher in years when wind conditions during the larval development period (March-April) were moderate to strong. Meristic variation (number of anal fin rays) depends on wind conditions in a manner consistent with the role of wind on abundance. In years with strong winds, meristic variation along the coast is low due to influx of progeny from the Skagerrak; in years with weak winds (when influx of Skagerrak progeny is low), regional variation in meristic counts is larger. These abundance and meristic patterns are consistent with historical observations of stock distribution and mixing in the area, and demonstrate the potential for physical processes to mediate exchange of eggs and larvae between areas. Abundances showed no evidence of long-term changes, even after allowing for the significant role of wind on abundance, and despite eutrophication of the Kattegat. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

In the last 20 years, there have been increasing concerns regarding the environmental impact of large increases in the amounts of PW released into the North Sea. We have previously shown that low levels of APs can induce disruption of the endocrine and reproductive systems of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). The aims of this follow-up study were to: (i) identify the lowest observable effect concentration of APs; (ii) study the effects of exposure to real PW, obtained from a North Sea oil-production platform; and (iii) study the biological mechanism of endocrine disruption in female cod. Fish were fed with feed paste containing several concentrations of four different APs (4-tert-butylphenol, 4-n-pentylphenol, 4-n-hexylphenol and 4-n-heptylphenol) or real PW for 20 weeks throughout the normal period of vitellogenesis in Atlantic cod from October to January. Male and female cod, exposed to AP and PW, were compared to unexposed fish and to fish fed paste containing 17Œ≤-oestradiol (E2). Approximately 60% of the females and 96% of the males in the unexposed groups were mature at the end of the experiment. Our results show that exposure to APs and E2 have different effects depending on the developmental stage of the fish. We observed that juvenile females are advanced into puberty and maturation, while gonad development was delayed in both maturing females and males. The AP-exposed groups contained increased numbers of mature females, and significant differences between the untreated group and the AP-treated groups were seen down to a dose of 4Œºg AP/kg body weight. In the high-dose AP and the E2 exposed groups, all females matured and no juveniles were seen. These results suggest that AP-exposure can affect the timing of the onset of puberty in fish even at extremely low concentrations. Importantly, similar effects were not seen in the fish that were exposed to real PW. ¬© 2011 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,NA,Scopus,K,North Sea - CS,NA,month,NA,NA,Laboratory,statistical analysis,2,2,3,NA,NA,Gadus morhua,NA,Contaminants & Pollution,Reproduction,NA,Mixed response,Mixed,NA,ABIOTIC ANTHROPIC

In this paper we investigate the causes for the lack of relationship between food and survival for anchovy juvenile through analyses of feeding activity versus zooplankton distribution (in the transition from summer to fall from 2003 to 2010). The spatial distribution of the stomach weights of juvenile anchovy in relation to body size on and off the shelf revealed higher stomach fullness in areas off the shelf, where less zooplankton biomass was available. This result indicates that the food concentration is not always the main factor determining ingestion in fish. A situation of comparatively lesser prey abundance may provide better feeding conditions when combined with lower predation risk and lower light attenuation. In addition, the relatively heavier stomachs found in anchovies caught in years of higher recruitment indices suggest a large stomach content may be a symptom of good biological condition that may favour the winter survival of a larger fraction of the juvenile stock. ¬© 2012 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,K,Western Waters - CS,">100,000",decade,"10,000-50,000",year,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey,GLM,3,3,3,NA,NA,Engraulis encrasicolus,juveniles,Plankton,Other,stomach fullness,No response,NA,"stomach fullness is higher in area offshelf deqspinte lower zooPK ocncentration than on the continental shelf, propbably as better feeding conditions (lower predation risk and lower light attenuation).

We use a cross-disciplinary approach combining genetics, transport modelling, survey time series analyses and physical oceanographic modelling to investigate 3 hypotheses on the reasons for this change. Evidence from connectivity studies suggests that the population of North Sea anchovy is separate from that in the Bay of Biscay. The recruitment pulses observed in survey data fit a life cycle which includes spawning in early summer and larval development in late summer. This also supports the concept of population expansion originating from local remnant population(s). In terms of growth physiology, suitable thermal windows have expanded, making conditions more favourable for life cycle closure and population persistence/productivity. In addition to the increased frequency of warm summers, which favour larvae and juvenile growth, the decrease in the number of severe winters is also likely to improve overwinter survival. Overall, the evidence supports the hypothesis that the increase in anchovy abundance originated from the improved productivity of existing populations.

The influence of water column stability on the spatial distribution of fish larvae and their prey is widely acknowledged. Water column stability may also impact growth through the early life history of fishes, and consequently alter the probability of survival to maturity by limiting susceptibility to predation and starvation. As a test of this concept, the variability in condition and growth of dab (Limanda limanda) and sprat (Sprattus sprattus) larvae was investigated in relation to seasonal stratification of the water column in the north-western Irish Sea. RNA/DNA ratios and otolith microincrement analysis were used to estimate nutritional status and recent growth rates of larvae captured on four cruises in May and June of 1998 and 1999. Dab and sprat larvae were less abundant in 1999 and were in poorer condition with lower growth rates than in 1998. Dab larvae of <13 mm also exhibited spatial variability with higher RNA/DNA ratios at the seasonal tidal-mixing front compared with stratified and mixed water masses. However, the growth and nutritional status of sprat larvae was uncorrelated to water column stability, meaning the more favourable feeding conditions generally associated with the stratified pool and tidal-mixing front in the Irish Sea were not reflected in the growth and condition of these larvae. This suggests that the link between stability, production and larval growth is more complicated than inferred by some previous studies. The existence of spatio-temporal heterogeneity in the growth and condition of these larvae has implications for larval survival and the recruitment success of these species in the Irish Sea. ¬© 2006 The Authors.",English,Article,,Scopus,K,Western Waters - CS,"50,000-100,000",two year,"5,000-10,000",subday,Physiological Growth Indicators,anova/ancova,3,3,3,NA,NA,Sprattus sprattus,"early life stages (eggs, larvae)",Other,Growth,NA,No response,NA,driver: stratification,Other

Eventually, the implications of the results for North Sea cod stock recovery plans were discussed. ¬© 2005 NRC.",English,Article,,Scopus,K,North Sea - CS,">100,000",multidecadal,">100,000",year,Simulated dynamics,MSVPA model calibrated with diet data + GLM,3,3,3,NA,NA,Merlangius merlangus,juveniles,Predator pressure,Survival,NA,Overall positive response,Medium,predator = grey gurnard - increased population in the NS since the 80s,PREDATOR

Slow rates of recovery and continuing declines may be attributable to depensation, defined as a reduction in per capita growth rate concomitant with reduced population size. Several potential causes of depensation relate to low mating success and consequent reduced production of offspring. We explore the empirical basis of one of these in Atlantic cod using egg fertilization and male abundance data obtained from 21 experimental populations generated by three independent research programmes. We find support for the hypotheses that (a) fertilization rate declines with abundance and (b) variance in fertilization rate increases as population size declines. The former identifies one potential mechanism underlying depensation in Atlantic cod. The latter has negative genetic consequences for effective population size (N e), resulting in a decline in the ratio of N e to census population size (N e/N c) with declining abundance. Our results may have general implications for the conservation biology of broadcast-spawning marine fish, particularly those with mating systems similar to that of Atlantic cod. ¬© 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

It is suggested that this treatment, which assumes isolation from the cod of the rest of the North Sea, is justified by the low rate of emigration from or immigration into the west-central North Sea from other areas, a situation which has been enhanced by the locally high fishing mortality rate. Both catchability and the growth rate are shown to have been inversely correlated with stock abundance, which has changed dramatically following a succession of strong year classes between 1963 and 1970. The exploitation pattern is shown to have been generated by independent sections of the exploiting fleet which concentrate upon either young (ages 1 to 4) or old (age 6+) fish.

The lesser sandeel (Ammodytes marinus) is one of the ecologically and economically most important forage fish species in the North-east Atlantic, acting as a key prey for predatory fish and sea birds, as well as supporting a large commercial fishery. In this case study, we investigate the underlying factors affecting recruitment and how these in turn affect productivity of the North Sea sandeel using long-term data and modelling. Our results demonstrate how sandeel productivity in the central North Sea (Dogger Bank) depends on a combination of external and internal regulatory factors, including fishing and climate effects, as well as density dependence and food availability of the preferred zooplankton prey (Calanus finmarchicus and Temora longicornis). Furthermore, our model scenarios suggest that while fishing largely contributed to the abrupt stock decline during the late 1990s and the following period of low biomass, a complete recovery of the stock to the highly productive levels of the early 1980s would only be possible through changes in the surrounding ecosystem, involving lower temperatures and improved feeding conditions.

In this paper, we combine time series analysis and simulations to investigate the long-term dynamics of an overexploited population in the Mediterranean Sea, and its link with both fishing-induced demographic changes and hydroclimatic variability. We show that the cyclicity of the catch per unit of effort (CPUE) of European hake Merluccius merluccius (EH) vanished in the 1980s, while the correlation between the CPUE and a local environmental index increased. Using simulations, we then show that the cyclicity observed in the EH biomass before the 1980s can have an internal origin, while that its disappearance could be due to the fishinginduced erosion of the age structure. Our results suggest that fishing can trigger a switch from internally generated to externally forced population fluctuations, the latter being characterised by an increasing dependency of the population on recruitment and ultimately on environmental variability. Hydroclimatic modifications occurring in the Mediterranean in the early 1980s could have enhanced these changes by leading to a mismatch between early life stages of EH and favorable environmental conditions. Our conclusions underline the key effect of the interaction between exploitation and climate on the dynamics of EH and its important consequences for management and conservation. ¬© Inter-Research 2011.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,K,Mediterranean - non CS,">100,000",multidecadal,NA,year,Fisheries Dependent Data,correlation between time-series,3,3,3,NA,NA,Merluccius merluccius,adults,Climate,Abundance,NA,NA,Large,"driver = regional climate indice including SST, surface air T∞, atmospheric sea level pressure, precipitation - The correlations were statistically non

However, despite its wide geographical distribution, there have been few studies on fluctuations in the European hake populations. Marine ecosystem shifts have been investigated worldwide and their influence on trophic levels has been studied, from top predator fish populations down to planktonic prey species, but there is little information on the effect of atmosphere-ocean shifts on European hake. This work analyses hake recruitment success (recruits per adult biomass) in relation to environmental changes over the period 1978-2006 in order to determine whether the regime shift identified in several abiotic and biotic variables in the North Sea also affected the Northeast Atlantic shelf oceanography. Hake recruitment success as well as parameters such as the sea surface temperature, wind patterns and copepod abundance changed significantly at the end of the 1980s, demonstrating an ecological regime shift in the Northeast Atlantic. Despite the low reproductive biomass recorded during the last decades, hake recruitment success has been higher since the change in 1989/90. The higher productivity may have sustained the population despite the intense fishing pressure; copepod abundance, warmer water temperatures and moderate eastward transport were found to be beneficial. In conclusion, in 1988/89 the Northeast Atlantic environment shifted to a favourable regime for northern hake production. This study supports the hypothesis that the hydro-climatic regime shift that affected the North Sea in the late 1980s may have influenced a wider region, such as the Northeast Atlantic. ¬© 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",English,Article,,Scopus,K,NE-Atlantic,">100,000",multidecadal,NA,year,Fisheries Dependent Data,t-test and probabilistic classification model,3,3,3,NA,NA,Merluccius merluccius,"early life stages (eggs, larvae)",Climate,Reproduction,Recruitment/SSB,Overall positive response,Large,"driver = atmosphere ocean shift  with changes in  SST, wind patterns and copepod abundance",CLIMATE & OCEANOGRAPHY

We analysed the robustness of relationships among abiotic habitat properties (temperature, salinity and depth) and abundance. Small cod was mainly found in low salinity areas of the Skagerrak but larger year classes were able to expand their distribution area towards the central and northern North Sea. In contrast, grey gurnard was mainly found in waters with salinities above 33 and temperatures above 14¬∞C. This species has expanded its high density areas in the central North Sea northward over the last two decades. Recruitment success of cod was negatively correlated to a Moran's I cross-correlation index, a proxy for the degree of spatial overlap between both species. Strong cod year classes overlapped less with grey gurnard at the large and medium spatial scale. In general, the relationships between abiotic habitat properties and abundance showed an increased inter-annual variability, which was likely caused by underlying factors not taken into account in the distribution models.

Here, we inferred the temporal origin of 2-year classes (2002-2003) of western and central Baltic sprat by means of otolith microstructure analysis, and found that in both years recruits mainly originated from the summer months June and July. In both years, this period coincided with temperature conditions in the surface layer of >12 ¬∞C and peak seasonal abundance of the largest copepod stages of Acartia spp., the major prey item of sprat larvae.

Sprat recruitment, however, was comparatively strong in both 2002 and 2003, suggesting that summer born individuals had high enough survival rates to compensate for the spawning shift, possibly due to high summer temperatures, limited dispersion, and low predation mortalities by Baltic cod as the major predator of sprat.

In this study, we identify correlations between large-scale climatic indicators, temperature, primary and secondary productivity, and fish recruitment in the Irish Sea and incorporate them into an Ecopath with Ecosim food web model co-created by scientists and fishers.

In sea trout, an increasing smolt length was not significantly correlated with the survival in good herring recruitment years, but in poor years survival increased very rapidly with increasing smolt size. The recapture rates of the salmonids tended to decrease between the years 1970 and 2001. During the same time period, the June SST slightly decreased. The positive correlation between the annual summer SST and recapture rate of salmon may partly explain the decreasing trend in recapture rates.

The decrease in the numbers of cod eggs in the ichthyoplankton, in general, coincided with a decrease in the proportion of spawners maturing at the beginning of the season of mass reproduction and a decrease in the oxygen content in the near-bottom layer of the Gdansk Deep.

There was also a weaker correlation between the decreasing river discharge in the spring and the onset of the smolt migration.

Flounder (Platichthys flesus (L.)) is the main target species for monitoring health effects of contamination in North Sea and Baltic Sea since the species is abundant, benthic, and inhabits shallow waters such as the Wadden Seas and estuaries along salinity gradients into fresh water. Chemical analysis in the same livers as investigated for histopathology in the present study showed positive correlation between accumulation of certain organochlorines in liver and the extend of liver injury. Toxipathic liver changes including neoplasms in female and male flounder were analysed by macroscopic and light microscopic diagnosis during a five-year survey on the basis of internationally accepted criteria agreed upon during the European BEQUALM intercalibration of liver histopathology of flatfish. Hepatocellular carcinogenesis of wild flounder principally showed sequential changes similar to experimental chemical carcinogenesis in other fish species and mammals. These ranged from early foci of altered hepatocytes (vacuolated/clear/eosinophilic, basophilic cells) and the development of adenomas. With progression to hepatocellular carcinomas, livers of wild flounder entered a multistage phase of carcinogenesis comprising of early foci, hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas, as observed in human liver cancers. Female flounder had three-fold higher frequencies of macroscopically visible neoplasms than males of the same age classes. Histopathological diagnosis showed that hepatocellular alterations in male flounder never developed further than stages of basophilic foci and adenomas, and never into malignancies. In females, tumors of hepatocellular origin clearly dominated, occurred alone and together with cancers of bile duct epithelial cells and endothelial cells (cholangio-carcinomas, angiosarcomas). Because mutations of relevant genes could not be identified in the liver cancers that were analysed in the present study, we conclude that epigenetic events initiate carcinogenesis. Therefore, we conclude that mitogenic carcinogens found in the Elbe estuary play a dominant role for cancer development in this flounder population. Furthermore, the lower availability of reducing power (NADPH) needed for detoxification reactions in females compared to males, together with annual upregulation of the highly potent promotor 17-Œ≤-estradiol during sexual maturation, promote progression of preneoplastic foci of initiated cells to malignant cancers in females. ¬© 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This can increase their vulnerability to fishing and predation. We detected density-dependent habitat selection by juvenile Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) (ages 1 and 2) in the North Sea and compared the observed distribution-abundance relationships with those predicted from a model based on ideal free distribution theory and knowledge of optimal temperatures for growth, where temperature was used as a measure of suitability. As predicted by the model, in years when stock size was low, the catches were largely confined to regions with near-optimal bottom temperatures. Conversely, when population size was high, catches were spread across a larger area including regions with suboptimal temperatures. The spatial extent of optimal habitat appears to have decreased from 1977 to 2002, reflecting a gradual warming of the North Sea.

Reproductive traits are expected to be under strong selection when the new environment limits reproductive success of the invading species. This may be especially important for external fertilizers, which release sperm and eggs into the new environment. Despite adult tolerance to high salinity, the invasive fish Neogobius melanostomus (round goby) is absent from fully marine regions of the Baltic Sea, raising the possibility that its distribution is limited by tolerance during earlier life stages. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that the spread of N.¬†melanostomus is limited by sperm function in novel salinities. We sampled sperm from two invasion fronts with higher and lower salinities in the Baltic Sea and tested them across a range of salinity levels. We found that sperm velocity and percentage of motile sperm declined in salinity levels higher and lower than those currently experienced by the Baltic Sea populations, with different performance curves for the two fronts. Sperm velocity also peaked closer to the home salinity conditions in each respective invasion front, with older localities showing an increased fit to local conditions. By calculating how the sperm velocity has changed over generations, we show this phenotypic shift to be in the range of other fish species under strong selection, indicating ongoing local adaptation or epigenetic acclimation to their novel environment. These results show that while immigrant reproductive dysfunction appears to at least partly limit the distribution of invasive N.¬†melanostomus in the Baltic Sea, local adaptation to novel environments could enable future spread beyond their current boundaries. ¬© 2019 The Authors.

This would imply that either larval fishes are living in an environment characterized by plenty of food, that nutritional condition selective mortality (i.e., eliminating the weak) is very strong, or this impression is caused by misinterpretation of data concerning e.g., poor taxonomical resolution of potential prey items, i.e., total potential prey abundance is high, but positively selected food is actually scarce. We analyzed RNA:DNA derived growth rates of herring larvae (Clupea harengus L.) and taxonomically differentiated prey field data of six consecutive spring seasons from the Kiel Canal, an artificial waterway in northern Germany, in order to test if food-limited growth in larval fish can occur recurrently in coastal habitats. In all years analyzed, larval growth rates decreased simultaneously with prey abundance at the end of each larval season. Furthermore, larval growth rates were observed to be lower than mean growth rates observed in another herring larvae nursery area at temperatures above 15 ¬∞C. Asymptotic relationships between prey abundance and larval growth rates were observed, further supporting the hypothesis of food-limitation. As larval growth was best explained by the abundance of the numerically dominant calanoid copepod Eurytemora affinis, the paramount importance of the dominant prey item is highlighted. We conclude that food limitation can be a severe and re-occurring issue for larval fish in coastal habitats, and that certain prey items play a crucial role in determining larval growth rates, and therefore potentially recruitment. ¬© The Author(s) 2016.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,K,Baltic Sea - CS,"50,000-100,000",five year,NA,NA,Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey,linear regression,1,1,1,NA,Inshore areas (Kiel Canal) ,Clupea harengus,"early life stages (eggs, larvae)",Prey availability,Growth,instantanuous growth rate ,Overall positive response,Large,indirect relationship (no stomach content),FOOD

Along the French coast of the Southern Bight of the North Sea and the Eastern English Channel, we compared 2 sites located in intensively developed and industrialised harbour areas (Dunkerque and Calais), 1 site in a medium and less industrialised harbour (Boulogne), 1 site near a large and polluted estuary (Seine) and 3 other sites located near small estuaries less subject to human pressure (Canche, Authie and Somme). Indicators of human disturbance as well as hydrological and biotic data were used to establish between-site differences in environmental quality. Our results indicate consistent differences in the growth and condition indices of 0-group sole among the 7 sites.

Herring attach their demersal eggs to benthic substrates, rendering reproduction success vulnerable to environmental changes and local habitat alterations. However, little information is available on the effects of different substrates on the survival of demersal eggs. Hypothesizing that the structural complexity of spawning substrates generally affects herring egg survival and that the effect magnitude depends on the suitability of ambient environment, field experiments were conducted on a major spawning ground of C. harengus in the Southwestern Baltic Sea. Herring eggs were artificially spawned on substrates of different structural complexities and incubated in situ under differing temperature regimes, at the beginning and the end of the natural herring spawning season, to include the full suite of stressors occurring on littoral spawning beds. Results of this study indicate a positive relation between high structural complexity of spawning substrates and herring egg survival. Mean egg mortality was three times higher on substrates of lowest complexity than on highly complex substrates. These differences became even more prominent under unfavorable conditions that appeared with rising water temperatures later in the spawning season. Although the mechanisms are still unclear, we conclude that structural complexity, particularly formed by submerged aquatic vegetation, provides a crucial prerequisite for the successful reproduction of substrate spawning marine fishes such as herring in the Baltic Sea. ¬© 2017, Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.",English,Article,,Scopus,K,Baltic Sea - CS,0-5,two year,NA,month,Tethering Experiments,ANOVA,2,2,2,NA,habitat structural complexity,Clupea harengus,"early life stages (eggs, larvae)",Other,Survival,%viable eggs,Overall positive response,Large,NA,Other

In the present study, large females were found to produce larger eggs with neutral egg buoyancy at a lower salinity, implying egg development in more favourable oxygen conditions. An age- and batch-specific model of egg production, egg size and egg buoyancy showed a substantial increase in the probability of egg survival with female age. The relationship between egg production by old females and subsequent recruitment was tested in two separated periods with different conditions: 1967-1980 and 1981-1994. The number of recruited cod (age 2), in the Baltic Sea, was positively related to the fraction of eggs produced by old females (‚â•5 years).

The current age estimation criterion using otoliths of megrim was corroborated by tracking year-class abundance indices in the surveys. The strength of the year-classes was well tracked and significant correlations between abundance of consecutive age-groups from the same cohort were obtained.

The first step to elucidate the potential for adaptation to unfavorable thermal conditions is to assess the degree of genotype-based variation in thermal reaction norms of vital fitness traits. Marine broadcast spawning fishes experience extremely high rates ofmortality during early life stages. Paternally derived (genetic) variation underlying offspring fitness in adverse environmental conditions may therefore hold important implications for resilience. This study examined how males differ in their ability to sire viable offspring and whether the paternal contribution modified thermal reaction norms for hatching success in two replicated trials with cod Gadus morhua from the Northwest Atlantic (trial 1) and Baltic Sea (trial 2). Each trial included five temperature treatments (2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0 ¬∞C in trial 1, and 6.5, 8.0, 9.5, 11.0, 12.5 ¬∞C in trial 2) encompassing optimum conditions as well as the amount of warming projected in various future pathways for the year 2100. In both trials, mean hatching success significantly decreased towards thermal extremes. However, half-sibling families varied in their response to different incubation temperatures as indicated by significant paternity √ó temperature interactions and crossing of reaction norms. The influence of paternity itself was highly significant and explained 56% and 44% of the observed variation in hatching success in trials 1 and 2, respectively. Early embryogenesis represented the most crucial developmental period in terms of thermal tolerance and paternally mediated variation in hatching success. High variation in daily embryo survival among half-sibling families and temperature treatments was observed during blastula and gastrulation stages (until 100% epiboly), while almost no mortality occurred during subsequent development and throughout the hatching period. The observed magnitude of genetic variation underlying thermal reaction norms for embryo viability represents a relevant resource for adaptive responses (favorable selection) of cod populations exposed to environmental variability and/or directional changes, such as ongoing ocean warming. ¬© 2015 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,,Scopus,K,Baltic Sea - CS,">100,000",month,NA,day,Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey,Kaplan Meier survival,2,2,3,NA,NA,Gadus morhua,"early life stages (eggs, larvae)",Temperature,Survival,survival probablity,Overall negative response,Large,optimal type relationship for nort western atlantic cod,TEMPERATURE

Feeding ecology studies are among the primary sources for improving predictions related to community structures, for example, by revealing potential competitive interactions between native and invasive species. We compared the stomach contents and studied diet overlaps among a native (Mullus barbatus) and two invasive (Upeneus moluccensis and U. pori) mullid species, collected off the coasts of the northeastern Levantine where invasive mullids have been part of the ecosystem for more than half a century. We also assessed the effect of sex, sampling period, depth and size on stomach contents. Schoener‚Äôs index indicated significant diet overlaps between U. moluccensis‚ÄìU. pori and U. moluccensis‚ÄìM. barbatus. Diets of U. pori and M. barbatus did not significantly overlap, which was explained by their differing depth preferences. Assessment of stomach contents showed that Crustacea, specifically Decapoda, was the main prey group across the studied mullid species. Polychaeta was also of high importance in the diet of the native M. barbatus, but not for the two invasive Upeneus species.

Questions: Do coastal populations of cod differ in life history? If so, is the variability spatially persistent and does it vary with time? What factors are responsible for life-history differences among the potential populations? Method: Use long-term, fisheries-independent survey data to measure and compare lifehistory metrics among nine regions along the southern Norwegian coast. Conduct maturity analyses, using generalized linear mixed-effect models, where the probability of being mature is a function of fixed effects (length, age, weight, sex, and growing degree days) and random effects (location and year class nested within location). Results: We detected that the probability of being mature has increased spatially (along an increasing longitudinal cline) and temporally (throughout a 30-year time-series). Neither of these trends could be fully explained by variation in sea temperature or population density. Conclusion: Life-history variability in a highly mobile marine fish can be evident, and temporally persistent, at spatial scales considerably smaller than those encompassed by established fisheries management units and species recovery strategies. Our findings provide empirically defensible justification for studies on the ecological factors and evolutionary mechanisms responsible for producing and maintaining this variability. ¬© 2016 Nancy E.

Reasons for a shift in peak spawning time of Baltic cod from spring/early summer to midsummer since the early 1990s remain unresolved and may partly be diet related. This study demonstrated that a substantial amount of lipid was invested in cod ovarian development, and that lipid composition varied substantially with the reproductive cycle. Selective retention of the essential fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (ARA) in ovaries during maturation was evident, but despite mobilization from the liver, ARA levels were low in ovaries during late maturation and spawning. Astaxanthin and -tocopherol accumulated in cod ovaries and decreased in late maturing and spawning fish, most likely due to their antioxidant protection activity. The fatty acid composition of cod liver reflected its clupeid prey. The ratio of 18:1n-9 to DHA was almost twice as high in sprat as in herring and indicated the ratio of sprat and herring in cod diet, while the level of 16:1n-7 and astaxanthin indicated the presence of the isopod Saduria entomon in cod diet. It is likely that food web alterations in the Baltic ecosystem related to environmental and hydrographic changes caused a decrease in ARA availability. Low ARA content coincides with cod ovarian development in the central Baltic Sea, and may be associated with the delay in spawning and affect egg and larval survival; however, this needs further verification in experimental studies. ¬© Inter-Research 2012.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,K,Baltic Sea - CS,"50,000-100,000",half year,NA,NA,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey,PCA_ANOVA,1,1,1,NA,"paper relates lipid content of liver and ovary to maturity stages of cod, unclear how this relates to prey availability",Gadus morhua,adults,Prey availability,Maturity,lipid dynamcs and content,Mixed response,Small,NA,FOOD

While some fish populations may be able to escape global warming via range shifts, they cannot escape ocean acidification (OA), an inevitable consequence of the dissolution of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in marine waters. How ocean acidification affects population dynamics of commercially important fish species is critical for adapting management practices of exploited fish populations. Ocean acidification has been shown to impair fish larvae's sensory abilities, affect the morphology of otoliths, cause tissue damage and cause behavioural changes. Here, we obtain first experimental mortality estimates for Atlantic cod larvae under OA and incorporate these effects into recruitment models. End-of-century levels of ocean acidification (‚àº1100 Œºatm according to the IPCC RCP 8.5) resulted in a doubling of daily mortality rates compared to present-day CO2 concentrations during the first 25 days post hatching (dph), a critical phase for population recruitment. These results were consistent under different feeding regimes, stocking densities and in two cod populations (Western Baltic and Barents Sea stock). When mortality data were included into Rickertype stock-recruitment models, recruitment was reduced to an average of 8 and 24% of current recruitment for the two populations, respectively. Our results highlight the importance of including vulnerable early life stages when addressing effects of climate change on fish stocks. ¬© 2016 Stiasny et al.

Although the hydrographic conditions conducive for survival of early life stages improved during the 1990s, recruitment success of cod remained far below average. As clupeids have been identified as major predators on cod eggs and larvae in the Baltic, increased predation may be an important factor hampering stock recovery. Results from stomach content analysis of herring and sprat during the spawning season of 1988-1995 and ichthyoplankton surveys in the Bornholm Basin (the only important spawning area of cod in the Central Baltic in this period) allow a comparison of estimated consumption rates by the predator populations with standing stocks and production rates of cod eggs and larvae. Despite uncertainties in the estimation procedure, the findings confirm substantial predation on cod eggs by both clupeid species. Especially at the beginning of the cod-spawning season, characterized by low zooplankton availability, sprat consumed a considerable proportion of the eggs produced. In 1993, the relative importance of zooplankton as prey increased, while fish eggs were encountered more rarely. In contrast, predation by herring remained on the same level or even increased, especially late in the spawning season. The larval stage of cod is not substantially affected by predation owing to limited spatial overlap between prey and predator.

According to a recent model of thermal tolerance the downward shift of tolerance limits during cold adaptation is associated with rising mitochondrial densities and, thus, aerobic capacity and performance in the cold, especially in eurythermal species. At the same time the costs of mitochondrial maintenance reflected by mitochondrial proton leakage should rise leaving a lower energy fraction for growth and reproduction. The preliminary conclusion can be drawn that warming will cause a northern shift of distribution limits for both species with a rise in growth performance and fecundity larger than expected from the Q10 effect in the north and lower growth or even extinction of the species in the south. Such a shift may heavily affect fishing activities in the North Sea. ¬© 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

As a prerequisite, we analyse here how this variability relates to population dynamics in conjunction with environmental conditions. For that, spatio-temporal statistical approaches are needed but seldom used in fisheries science. To fill this gap, we showcase the usefulness of the method of empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs). Guidelines are given to apply the method on a series of gridded maps as derived from fisheries survey dataseries that now span over decades. The method is applied to the series, 2000-2012, of the spatial distributions of European anchovy in the Bay of Biscay at spawning time. Across the series, the EOF decomposition allowed to identify three main types of spatial distributions. One type corresponded to an extended distribution, another to a restricted distribution in core areas, and the third to a very coastal distribution. The coastal spawning distribution corresponded to a low population growth rate as it was never followed by a large recruitment in the subsequent year. We did not attempt to explain the spatial patterns per se but the drivers of change from one type of distribution to another. Stock size and fish size as well as bottom temperature and water column stratification were the covariates that controlled the variability in the spatial distributions over time. Further, the spatial distribution at spawning time related to recruitment in the following year, meaning that variability in the spatial distribution of spawning affected population dynamics. The typology of maps based on EOF decomposition summarized this spatial variability into spatial spawning configurations, which may serve spatial planning. ¬© International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2014.

However, the effects of these processes on growth and condition of zooplankton and larval fish are at present poorly understood. In this study, we utilized phytoplankton group- specific fatty acid content to trace the phytoplankton group and mixing regime contributing to the condition of individual juvenile North Sea cod. In order to establish a relationship between lipid tracer content and algal utilization, post yolk-sac larval North Sea cod were reared in the laboratory on food chains based on monocultures of either the diatom Skeletonema costatum or the dinoflagellate Heterocapsa triquetra (algae dominating in the mixed and stratified regions of the North Sea). In the laboratory, these algae were led to cultures of adult Acartia tonsa, the copepod eggs were collected, hatched and the N1 nauplii from these different feeding regimes fed to post yolk-sac larval North Sea cod. Post yolk-sac larval cod required 8 d on either Heterocapsa- or Skeletonema-based food chain before tracer lipid signals (the ratio of the lipids 16:1œâ7 to 16:0) in the larvae began to change from their original values to those similar to the algae at the base of their respective food chains. The cod larvae displayed a lipid tracer content similar to that of their algal food source after 13 d on their respective feeding regimes. During a cruise in May 1992 to examine the distribution of larval and juvenile North Sea cod, a subsample of 100 juvenile cod from the stratified, mixed and frontal regimes of the northeastern North Sea were examined tel their content of lipid biomarkers and condition (as determined by the ratio of total lipid content to total length).

Mean larval stage duration varied between about 40 and 60 d, without any clear significant pattern between or within years. Year-class strength of plaice in the western Wadden Sea was not related to mean larval stage duration. Mean larval stage duration did not show a clear pattern during the period of immigration, nor with reconstructed temperature conditions. The observed decrease of larval stage duration with temperature in the field was lower than that observed under laboratory conditions, suggesting food limitation with increasing temperature during drift. The fact that both within-year and for all years combined the number of immigrating larvae was inversely related to temperature conditions during drift suggested that year-class strength could be affected by temperature-mediated predation, but simultaneously occurring food limitation at high temperatures cannot be excluded. ¬© Inter-Research 2009.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,K,North Sea - CS,"50,000-100,000",decade,1000-5000,two week,Active net capture,Linear regression,3,3,3,"The observed decrease of larval stage duration with temperature in the field was lower than that observed under laboratory conditions, suggesting food limitation with increasing temperature during drift.

The invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) is spreading in Eurasia and the Americas, into both fresh and brackish water. We aim to understand if reproduction in different salinities is affected by an ability to acclimate. Location: Brackish and freshwater systems of northern Europe and the Baltic Sea. Methods: We cross-exposed round gobies of freshwater and brackish origin to 0 and 16 practical salinity units (PSU), and the fish were given nest boxes in which to spawn. After 4¬†weeks, we measured their sperm performance in both 0 and 16 PSU; fertilization success of each egg clutch was measured through visual analysis of eggs. Clutches were split and allowed to develop in both 0 and 16 PSU salinity, and reproductive success (zygote development) was measured 20¬†¬±¬†1¬†days later. Responses were analysed using generalized mixed models. Results: After a month, the fish showed no plasticity in sperm performance to their acclimation salinity, regardless of their origin. Sperm velocity was highest in the salinity similar to the males‚Äô origin. Significantly lower fertilization success was measured for individuals that reproduced outside their salinity of origin despite recurring spawning events in all treatment groups. Among fertilized eggs, zygote development was similar regardless of salinity treatment of either eggs or parents. Main Conclusions: Short-term acclimation to new salinities does not affect sperm performance in the round goby. Alternative hypotheses such as local adaption should be further investigated. Limits to the species‚Äô reproductive success, and therefore invasion processes, are likely dependent on environment-phenotype matches. Fish of brackish origin spawned successfully in freshwater, pointing to an increased risk of introducing populations of brackish origin into freshwater. ¬© 2021 The Authors.

Mean width of daily increments at distances between 20 and 170¬†Œºm from the otolith core were significantly higher in Landvik herring (peak spawning in May) compared with the two other populations, Coastal Skagerrak spring spawners (peak spawning in March-April) and Norwegian spring spawning herring (peak spawning in February-March). These population differences were observed for all studied year classes and years and highly consistent with expected temperature dependent larval growth based on timing of successive spawning events. The observed patterns imply that timing of spawning was population specific with a tendency of adult herring to spawn at the same time and under the same conditions as they hatched themselves. This was also supported by vertebral counts, which are negatively correlated with temperatures during the embryonic stage. Firstly, Landvik herring which experienced higher ambient temperature during the embryonic stage were characterised by significantly lower counts than herring from the two other populations. Secondly, daily otolith growth also tended to decrease with increasing vertebral counts within the populations.

In detail, we determined larval lipid content, growth rates based on RNA:DNA ratios, and fatty acid (FA) composition during the spawning season in the Central Baltic Sea, and evaluated these in light of feeding, mortality and recruitment (which were determined in parallel within the project 'GLOBEC Germany'). Based on the opposing trend of RNA:DNA and lipid content, as well as on previous observations, we hypothesized that lipid content and current feeding conditions are largely uncoupled in the early life stages of sprat due to reduced lipid anabolism. However, lipids still provide information in several ways: (1) segmented generalised linear models proved to be a suitable tool for identifying phases of lipid catabolism during development, with the slope reflecting size-specific environmental starvation pressure. This method detected a previously identified mismatch situation with suitable prey in the early spawning season, which increased mortality of larger larvae. (2) Estimated starvation resistance, a proxy that accounts for temperature-and sizedependent metabolism, reflected the likelihood of near future starvation of individual larvae. (3) Principal component analyses on FAs identified monthly differences in diet composition. Biomarkers indicated a dinoflagellate and/or microbial loop based carbon flux to the larvae. (4) Regression analyses revealed lower docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels in spring, but no obvious effect on growth. Food quality was generally high, and its impact on larval survival was less evident than that of prey size suitability. ¬© 2015 Inter-Research.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,K,Baltic Sea - CS,"50,000-100,000",quarter,"10,000-50,000",month,Active Net Capture,RNA: DNA combined with growth model,2,1,2,NA,"Only one year of data, does only allow conclusions via differences between months, but not about inter-annual variability ",Sprattus sprattus,"early life stages (eggs, larvae)",Temperature,Growth,RNA: DNA,Overall positive response,Large,NA,TEMPERATURE

Temporal fluctuations exhibiting a cyclic component at around 2-2.5 years were spatially structured on a local scale. The cycle in abundance appears to be a result of biotic interaction, such as competition for space and food and/or cannibalism between cohorts. Similar long-term trends were also observed, although those for the 0-group were more pronounced. In contrast to the 2-2.5 years' cycle, long-term trends were related to events taking place on a scale equal to or larger than the Norwegian Skagerrak.

We used DNA from archival (otolith) samples to reconstruct the temporal (1976‚Äì2011) genetic makeup of two mixed-stock flounder fisheries in the √Öland Sea (AS) and the Gulf of Finland (GoF). Both fisheries have hitherto been managed as a single stock of European flounders (Platichthys flesus), but were recently revealed to target two closely related species: the pelagic-spawning P.¬†flesus and the newly described, demersal-spawning P.¬†solemdali. While the AS and GoF fisheries were assumed to consist exclusively of P.¬†solemdali, P.¬†flesus dominated the GoF flounder assemblage (87% of total) in 1983, had disappeared (0%) by 1993, and remained in low proportions (10%‚Äì11%) thereafter. In the AS, P.¬†solemdali dominated throughout the sampling period (>70%), and P.¬†flesus remained in very low proportions after 1983. The disappearance of P.¬†flesus from the GoF coincides in time with a dramatic (~60%) decline in commercial landings and worsening environmental conditions in P.¬†flesus‚Äô northernmost spawning ground, the Eastern Gotland Basin, in the preceding 4‚Äì6¬†years. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that P.¬†flesus in the GoF is a sink population relying on larval subsidies from southern spawning grounds and the cause of their disappearance is a cessation of larval supply. Our results highlight the importance of uncovering unobserved genetic diversity and studying spatiotemporal changes in the relative contribution of different stock components, as well as the underlying environmental causes, to manage marine resources in the age of rapid anthropogenic change. ¬© 2018 The Authors.

Both fisheries have hitherto been managed as a single stock of European flounders (Platichthys flesus), but were recently revealed to target two closely related species: the pelagic-spawning P.¬†flesus and the newly described, demersal-spawning P.¬†solemdali. While the AS and GoF fisheries were assumed to consist exclusively of P.¬†solemdali, P.¬†flesus dominated the GoF flounder assemblage (87% of total) in 1983, had disappeared (0%) by 1993, and remained in low proportions (10%‚Äì11%) thereafter. In the AS, P.¬†solemdali dominated throughout the sampling period (>70%), and P.¬†flesus remained in very low proportions after 1983. The disappearance of P.¬†flesus from the GoF coincides in time with a dramatic (~60%) decline in commercial landings and worsening environmental conditions in P.¬†flesus‚Äô northernmost spawning ground, the Eastern Gotland Basin, in the preceding 4‚Äì6¬†years. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that P.¬†flesus in the GoF is a sink population relying on larval subsidies from southern spawning grounds and the cause of their disappearance is a cessation of larval supply. Our results highlight the importance of uncovering unobserved genetic diversity and studying spatiotemporal changes in the relative contribution of different stock components, as well as the underlying environmental causes, to manage marine resources in the age of rapid anthropogenic change. ¬© 2018 The Authors.

Observations show that the mean weight of central Baltic Sea herring (Clupea harengus), a quantity unbiased by fisheries, is indirectly influenced by the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) via a complex mediator chain, in which a transition from a marine to a freshwater state plays a major role. This observed trend is also projected for the future in regional climate change scenarios. The consequence of increasing precipitation is a reduction in the marine habitat, a change in the prey community and a decrease in the mean weight of three-year-old central Baltic Sea herring from 50-70 g in the late 1970s to 25-30 g today. The reduction in weight over this period represents a reduction in landings of approximately one million tons of herring and an economic loss of the order of ‚Ç¨100 million. ¬© 2019 Dippner, Fr√ºndt and Hammer.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,K,Baltic Sea - CS,">100,000",multidecadal,">100,000",year,Standard Fisheries Survey,Correlation and wavelet analysis,3,3,3,NA,NA,Clupea harengus,adults,Prey availability,Growth,weight at age,Overall positive response,Large,P. acuspes zooplankton,FOOD

Overall, in the depth interval between 600 and 1100 m, we found higher abundance of fish in 1988-1992 than in 2007, a decrease simultaneous with an increase of decapod crustaceans. Older and more recent haul replicates (after 20 years) had similar assemblage composition in the depth range 1300-1700 m, whereas we found significant changes at 1000 m. Diversity of fish was greater in 1988-1992 than in 2007, while diversity of decapod crustaceans increased between the two periods. Thus, there was a reorganization in benthopelagic communities, rather than a loss of biodiversity. This was in agreement with long-term changes described for diversity of (neritic) zooplankton in the western Mediterranean. We found a dominance of plankton-suprabenthos feeders (e.g. fish such as Lepidion lepidion, Hymenocephalus italicus and Alepocephalus rostratus; the decapods Plesionika spp. and Sergestes arcticus) in 1988-1992. In 2007 by contrast, dominance of plankton-suprabenthos feeders decreased, and assemblages were increasingly composed of benthos-feeding decapods (e.g. Aristeus antennatus, Pontophilus norvegicus and some hermit crabs) preying for instance on polychaetes. These results coincided with low/negative North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO) in 2007 and in the period immediately before (2004-2006) 2007 (increase of benthos feeders), and with high average NAO in 1988-1992 (decrease of benthos feeders, which in turn may enhance abundance of plankton feeders). The benthic decapod Calocaris macandreae and suprabenthos (small crustaceans, mostly peracarids, living on and just beneath the sediment surface) are key prey in food webs off Catalonian margins, acting as links between surface oceanographic processes and abundance of benthopelagic predators. A conceptual model is presented relating changes in climatic conditions with changes in deep-sea, benthic-suprabenthic food webs. Calocari macandreae was more abundant in 2007, after 3 years of negative NAO. Under negative/low NAO, rainfall and river discharges increase in the NW Mediterranean, which may enhance advective food inputs for macrobenthos. This fits well with the higher abundance of benthos feeders in 2007, as well as with the significant deepening of decapod crustacean assemblages in that same period. Suprabenthos, being short-lived and annual species, were more abundant under positive NAO conditions (1988-1992), probably enhancing the abundance or aggregation of suprabenthic/pelagic feeders. ¬© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

PMRN midpoints have significantly shifted downwards at most ages for cod, haddock and whiting, but not for Norway pout. Second, increased temperature and food abundance, loosened trophic competition and relaxed social pressure may also trigger growth-independent plasticity in maturation. Principal component regression of PMRN midpoints on annual estimates of relevant environmental variables exhibiting a temporal trend suggest that, despite some evidence of environmental effects, PMRN trends were mostly independent of growth-independent plasticity in haddock, whiting and male cod, but not in female cod. According to these findings, evolution of maturation, potentially in response to fishing, is plausible in haddock, whiting and male cod, but unlikely for Norway pout, and does not explain trends in female cod maturation. In agreement with life-history theory, the maturation response was larger in fast-growing, late- and large-maturing species exhibiting moderate reproductive effort. ¬© 2014 Inter-Research.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,K,North Sea - CS,">100,000",multidecadal,">100,000",multidecadal,Standard Fisheries Survey,Linear regression,2,2,2,"despite some evidence of environmental effects, PMRN trends were mostly independent of growth-independent plasticity in haddock, whiting and male cod, but not in female cod",study did not include density dependent effects,Merlangius merlangus,juv and adults,Temperature,Maturity,PMRN,Mixed response,Small,Significant effect only found for females,TEMPERATURE

The model includes a target set of fish species which are modelled with full length structure from egg to adult, together with a highly simplified size-spectrum representation of the rest of the ecosystem (zooplankton, benthos and other fish). For the structured fish species the food requirements for growth, maintenance and reproduction, together with a length-based prey preferences, are used to calculate predation mortalities on the prey. Model output can be assessed against a wide variety of independent observations. As an example we develop a model for cod Gadus morhua) and nine of its most important fish predators and prey in the North Sea. The model is confronted with time series of stock biomass, recruitment, and landings, as well as survey data on length distributions, and diet data. The results suggest that herring Clupea harengus) predation on early life history stages of cod is dynamically important, and that high herring abundance may play a role in the decline of stocks even during periods of declining fishing pressure.

During the experimental period, constant prey concentrations were maintained at one of the two nominal levels, under either a spring or an autumn light regime. Eggs of one autumn-spawning North Sea Buchan female herring were fertilized either with cryopreserved sperm from three Norwegian spring-spawning males or with fresh sperm from three Buchan males. Larvae of the two groups (the hybrids marked with alizarin) were mixed in replicated treatment tanks, thus ensuring identical environmental conditions. Mean larval growth rates were mostly influenced by food availability, but the hybrids grew significantly faster than the pure autumn-spawned offspring. In addition, the hybrids experienced a survival advantage at low prey concentrations. Hybrid survival was also somewhat better at high prey concentrations under a spring photoperiod than the corresponding group under an autumn photoperiod, suggesting a possible genetic adaptation to seasonal light conditions.

Multiple regressions indicate that a combination of the North Atlantic Oscillation index in the preceding year and the abundance of CPR young fish is the pair of variables that provide the best fit to the data.

This appeared to be primarily owing to a reduction in growth rate after the fish became demersal, and prior to the attainment of a length of c.28 cm. Prior to this length the growth rates of the 2 strong year classes as well as those of the 2 year classes immediately following them, were as low as those observed during the late 1920s. Once these year classes had attained this length, growth rates were maintained at a level comparable to that determined for the 1950s. During the late 1960s, due to the appearance of the 1962 and 1967 year classes, the biomass of the stock increased 4- to 7-fold for nearly a decade. Despite this, the growth rates for haddock >28 cm in length were not lower during the 1960s than they were during the 1950s, and they were higher than those during the 1920s.

Moreover, fishing, besides decreasing population size and changing demographic composition can alter allelic frequencies through fisheries-induced evolution by selecting for some particular traits. In the Bay of Biscay, a decreasing trend in both sardine body condition and size-at-age has recently been pointed out at the population level. The Probabilistic Maturation Reaction Norm (PMRN) approach was applied to help disentangle phenotypic plasticity and genetic changes. Based on the analysis of sardine spawning seasonality, PMRN was estimated by considering body condition as additional life-history state variable to predict the onset of maturation. The resulting PMRN was then used to investigate temporal trends in reaction norm midpoints to test whether changes in length at maturation can be explained by plastic and/or evolutionary adaptive change. Overall, our results emphasize for the first time that including sardine body condition as explanatory variable improves predictions of maturation probability. We found that better individual condition increases maturation probability. The assessment of temporal changes in length at maturation confirms the low plasticity in this trait for a species maturing mostly at age-1 and advocates for the use of a monthly time scale when investigating PMRNs for this species.

It is assumed that the dynamics of the egg abundance in the periods of mass cod spawning in northeastern areas was opposite in the Gotland and Bornholm basins. ¬© 2018, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,K,Baltic Sea - CS,">100,000",multidecadal,">100,000",year,Standard Fisheries Survey,By eye,3,3,1,NA,"Just a figure, no statistics",Gadus morhua,"early life stages (eggs, larvae)",River inputs,Abundance,NA,Overall positive response,Large,"No statistics, but realtionship logic from discussion",CLIMATE & OCEANOGRAPHY

Aiming to elucidate if the fertilization capacity may be maintained by increasing the number of spermatozoa produced, testis size for the euryhaline flounder Platichthys flesus with external fertilization was assessed along a salinity gradient; with spawning at a salinity of c. 7, 10‚Äì18 and 30‚Äì35. Fulton's condition factor K = 0.881 ¬± 0.085 (mean ¬± S.D.), 0.833 ¬± 0.096 and 0.851 ¬± 0.086, for fish spawning at salinities of c. 7, 10‚Äì18 and 30‚Äì35, respectively, with no difference between areas, i.e. analysed fish were in similar nutritional condition. A general linear model, with testes dry mass as the dependent variable and somatic mass as covariate resulted in a significant difference between areas‚Äìpopulations with larger testes for P. flesus spawning at a salinity of c. 7 but no difference between fish spawning at a salinity of 10‚Äì18 and 30‚Äì35. The result suggests that adaptation by increasing the number of spermatozoa produced may be a key mechanism for marine teleosts spawning in areas with low salinities to sustain the fertilization capacity as shown here for the euryhaline P. flesus. ¬© 2018 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles",English,Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,K,Baltic Sea - CS,">100,000",two year,">100,000",two year,Passive Net/pot/trap capture,ANOVA,3,3,3,NA,NA,Platichthys flesus,adults,Salinity,Other,NA,Overall negative response,Large,Testes dry mass higher when salinity is lower,CLIMATE & OCEANOGRAPHY

In natural settings, direct thermal effects on metabolism may be exaggerated or offset by behavioural responses influencing individual energy balance. Drawing on a newly developed proxy, we provide the first estimates of the thermal performance curve of field metabolism in a wild fish. We investigate the thermal sensitivity of field metabolic rate in two sympatric, genetically distinct ecotypes of Atlantic cod from the Skagerrak coast of southern Norway. The combined ecotype median of field metabolic rate increased with increasing temperature until around 16¬∞C, coincident with the thermal optimum for growth for juvenile Atlantic cod. Individual cod experienced temperatures in excess of the thermal optimum for field metabolic rate, indicating some degree of thermal limitation of field metabolism in a complex natural environment with the potential for thermal refugia. The two cod ecotypes showed different thermal performance curves for field metabolic rate, revealing that genetic components to temperature sensitivity persist beyond acclimation effects. The cold-adapted fjord ecotype maintained higher field metabolic rates at cooler temperatures than the warm-adapted North Sea ecotype, which showed clear preference for warmer waters around the thermal optimum. Field metabolic rates of the two ecotypes were strongly influenced by year and location of sampling, implying more complex behavioural responses to environmental conditions. We emphasise that the energy uses reflecting physiological conditions in the field should be considered in the evaluation of the effect of climatic variables on fish population dynamics and demonstrate that otolith isotopes provide an analytical framework to answer this question. ¬© 2020 Nordic Society Oikos.

Our study highlights the need for management approaches that account for species interactions across multiple trophic levels. ¬© 2019, The Author(s).",English,Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,K,Baltic Sea - CS,">100,000",multidecadal,">100,000",year,Standard Fisheries Survey,Partial least square regression,3,3,3,NA,NA,Gadus morhua,juv and adults,Other,Condition,NA,Overall negative response,Large,Negative effect of grey seal abundance ==> likely indirect effect via herring and sprat,Other

The oxygen concentration of the interstitial water was positively correlated to the permeability of the stream bed, and to the geometric mean diameter of the substratum. When the oxygen at 15 cm inside the stream bed was undiminished from surface values, the permeability of the stream bed was at least 6000 cm h-1 and the geometric mean diameter of the substratum at least 15.0 mm. When the interstitial oxygen concentration increased, the interstitial ammonium concentration decreased, the NO2 concentration remained stable and the NO3 concentration increased. The ETF survival up to hatching was highly dependent upon the oxygen concentration of the interstitial water. For survival from hatching to emergence, the geometric mean diameter of the substratum was the most important factor.

This study analyses the lipid content of red mullet (Mullus barbatus) pre-spawners in three different areas of the northwestern Mediterranean in relation to trawling activities and river runoff. The muscle lipid was considered as an indicator of the somatic condition of individuals whilst the gonad lipid was used as a proxy of the energy invested in reproduction. The results show that fish with the highest muscle lipid levels inhabited the area where fishing impact was lowest. Since the abundance and biomass of polychaetes, which represent the main food source for red mullet, were found to be lower in trawled zones than in unfished ones, we suggest that differences in the muscle lipid levels between areas might be attributed to variation in prey abundance in relation to fishing impact. However, no impact of river runoff on lipid reserves of red mullet was observed.

The stock spawns mainly around mid-February along the northeastern English and Scottish coasts and between Shetland and Norway. Sex ratios indicate that males, which mature younger than females (age-at-50%-maturity, respectively, 1.2 and 1.5 years), migrate out of the Skagerrak-Kattegat to the spawning grounds before females. There is a decrease in the 2+-group maturity ratios as well as in weight and female length from before to after spawning. The results indicate spawning mortality. Only some 20% of the 1-group reaches maturity in the first quarter, which is higher than assumed in the stock assessment. Although the maturity ogives are variable over time, this difference should be taken into account when estimating spawning-stock biomass in routine assessments. Growth is also variable, with a tendency for male maximum length to be smaller than that of females, and immature fish to be smaller than mature ones in each age group. The juvenile growth rate is higher when the stock density is low and results in a reduced age-at-50%-maturity.

The degree of density dependence exhibited at the population level is a combination of local density dependent effects acting on different spatial scales. In this study, we searched for density dependence in recruitment, growth and mortality of North Sea sandeel Ammodytes marinus at different spatial scales by analysing data at a spatial resolution specifically reflecting the mosaic of populated habitat patches. Two types of density dependent processes occurred: a shift in spatial distribution towards low mortality areas when overall recruitment was high, and an increase in local mortality as local density increased. When combined, these processes largely compensated for each other and the size of the overall population had little influence on population level mortality.

In the northern sandeel area it seems that strong year classes are unlikely if the retention due to unfavourable currents is poor, and that a high retention in the summer may favour a good year class. In the southern sandeel area no clear coupling between year class strength and larval drift is found, possibly because the retention always seems large enough for a potentially good year class.

In this context, the protection of these vital ecosystems is a critical issue for the management of fisheries resources. To that aim, functional approaches have to be developed that make it possible to assess habitat suitability and quality. The common sole, Solea solea (L.) was selected as an indicator species to identify the features of coastal and estuarine nursery habitats in the Bay of Biscay (France). Previous studies have shown that young-of-the-year (YOY) sole are strongly dependent upon various abiotic factors, and especially bathymetry, sediment cover and the extent of river plumes. We investigated whether taking into account biological variables, based on benthic macrofauna biomasses aggregated into trophic group, may improve the description of the juvenile sole distribution in the Vilaine estuary nursery. Results from Generalised Linear Models demonstrated the importance of integrating these biological variables in the determination of juvenile habitats at a local scale. The abundance of YOY sole was correlated with an index of the benthic invertebrates biomass and, more specifically, with the biomass of suspension feeders. This result was reinforced by a one-dimensional spatial statistical analysis, which pointed out the similar distribution of invertebrate macrobenthos and juvenile sole along the upstream/downstream gradient of the estuary. Moreover, the inter-annual variations of abundance and distribution of juveniles were synchronous with those of the macrobenthos. ¬© 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Growth of juvenile and early adult North East Atlantic mackerel was found to be decreasing since the late 1990s. Modelling showed that growth was related to density. Mean growth rate during the first year was tightly correlated with the density of juveniles and especially with juveniles from the previous cohort. This putative effect of juvenile density could be tracked in the length-at-age up to adult mackerel at commercially targeted sizes. However, as the mackerel grew towards adulthood, the effects of the same cohort became dominant. The effect of adult density was minor, but increasing with age. The ontogenetic progression in density dependant regulation of growth appeared to reflect the spatial dynamics (migration patterns) in the feeding season. This is the first time growth patterns quantified in the adult mackerel population have been linked to density related processes occurring within the nursery areas during the first year.

In the present work, we extend the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory to investigate how environment variability impacts the spawning timing and duration of a multiple-batch spawning species. The model is successfully applied to reproduce the growth and reproduction of anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) in the Bay of Biscay. The model captures realistically the start and ending of the spawning season, including the timing of the spawning events, and the change in egg number per batch. Using a realistic seasonal forcing of temperature and food availability derived from a bio-physical model, our simulation results show that two thirds of the total spawned mass already accumulates before the start of the spawning season and that the condition factor increases with body length. These simulation results are in accordance with previous estimations and observations on growth and reproduction of anchovy. Furthermore, we show how individuals of equal length can differ in reproductive performance according to the environmental conditions they encounter prior to the spawning season. Hatch date turns out to be key for fecundity at age-1 as it partly controls the ability to build up reserves allocated to reproduction. We suggest the model can be used to realistically predict spawning in spatially and temporally varying environments and provide initial conditions for bio-physical models used to predict larval survival. ¬© 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Atlantic cod in the Baltic has suffered a loss in condition which has been attributed mainly to hypoxia. Otoliths, the aragonitic structures that form part of the hearing/balance system in fishes, accumulate Mn in the presence of hypoxia and other reducing environments. Otoliths grow over the lifetime of fishes, and thus life-long records of hypoxia exposure exist for each individual fish. However, otolith Mn/Ca ratios are also sensitive to growth effects. We tested a new proxy to at least partially account for growth: Mn/Mg, since Mg levels reflect metabolic activity but not hypoxia. This and other elemental proxies were parsed annually from the otoliths to reconstruct lifetime histories of mean, maximum, and cumulative values of this proxy as well as others (Sr/Ca) that inform us about salinity conditions. We analyzed cod from five different time periods: Neolithic (4500 YBP, a normoxic baseline), 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s - under different hypoxia intensities, assessing fish growth and condition in relation to hypoxia experience recorded by otolith proxies. Fish growth decreased with increasing hypoxia exposure; condition at capture (measured by Fulton's K index) showed a strongly positive relation to growth indexed by magnesium (Mg/Ca). We conclude that cod otolith chemistry proxies not only inform about the hypoxia, growth, and metabolic status of cod, retrospectively throughout life, but also reflect the worsening situation for cod in the Baltic. ¬© 2018 Limburg and Casini.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,K,Baltic Sea - CS,">100,000",multidecadal,multidecadal,quarter,Archived otolith collections,Campana's biological intercept method,2,2,3,"We found strong, inverse relationships of hypoxia exposure to back-calculated growth",NA,Gadus morhua,hypoxia,Oxygen,Growth,Effect of hypoxia - Inverse,Overall negative response,Large,NA,CLIMATE & OCEANOGRAPHY

Two sympatric flounder (Platichthys flesus) ecotypes are present in the Baltic Sea, pelagic and demersal spawning flounder, both displaying ecological and physiological adaptations to the low-salinity environment of this young inland sea. In this study we have addressed three main research questions: 1) What environmental conditions characterize the spatial distribution and abundance of adult flounder during the spawning season? 2) What are the main factors defining the habitats of the two flounder ecotypes during the spawning season? 3) Where are the potential spawning areas of flounder? We modelled catch per unit of effort (CPUE) of flounder from gillnet surveys conducted over the southern and central Baltic Sea in the spring of 2014 and 2015 using generalized additive models. A general model included all the stations fished during the survey while two other models, one for the demersal and one for the pelagic spawning flounder, included only the stations where each flounder ecotype should dominate. The general model captured distinct ecotype-specific signals as it identified dual salinity and water depth responses. The model for the demersal spawning flounder revealed a negative relation with the abundance of round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) and a positive relation with Secchi depth and cod abundance. Vegetation and substrate did not play an important role in the choice of habitat for the demersal ecotype. The model for the pelagic spawning flounder showed a negative relation with temperature and bottom current and a positive relation with salinity. Spatial predictions of potential spawning areas of flounder showed a decrease in habitat availability for the pelagic spawning flounder over the last 20 years in the central part of the Baltic Sea, which may explain part of the observed changes in populations' biomass.

Information on reproduction habitat requirements and mortality sources were obtained from field or laboratory studies. In our modelling study we only quantified physical processes generating heterogeneity in spatial distribution of eggs and yolk-sac larvae, as e.g. predation is not accounted for. The spatial extent of eggs and larvae represented as modelled particles is primarily determined by oxygen and salinity conditions. The reproduction habitat most suitable was determined for the Gdansk Deep, followed by the Bornholm Basin. Relatively low habitat suitability was obtained for the Arkona Basin and the Gotland Basin. The model runs also showed yolk-sac larval survival to be to a large extent affected by sedimentation. Eggs initially released in the Arkona Basin and Bornholm Basin are strongly affected by sedimentation compared with those released in the Gdansk Deep and Gotland Basin. Highest relative survival of eggs occurred in the Gdansk Deep and in the Bornholm Basin. Relatively low survival rates in the Gotland Basin were attributable to oxygen-dependent mortality. Oxygen content had almost no impact on survival in the Arkona Basin. For all spawning areas mortality caused by lethally low temperatures was only evident after severe winters.

There are two sympatric flounder populations in the Baltic Sea, pelagic and demersal spawners, which differ in their spawning habitat and egg characteristics. In the present study, pelagic spawning flounder of the central Baltic Sea was studied. We examined whether variations in hydrological regime can explain fluctuations in flounder early life stages that have occurred over the past 30. years (1970-2005). Using generalized additive modeling to explain the abundance of flounder eggs and larvae in a Latvian ichthyoplankton dataset, we evaluate the hypothesis that the available reproductive volume, defined as the water column with dissolved oxygen larger than 1. ml/l and salinity between 10.6 and 12. PSU, affects the survival of flounder ichthyoplankton and determines recruitment success.Both reproductive volume and spawning stock biomass were significant factors determining flounder ichthyoplankton abundance. Different measures of water temperature did not contribute significantly to the variability of eggs or larvae. However, recruitment did not correlate to the supply of larvae. The findings presented in this study on the relationship between flounder reproduction, spawning stock biomass and reproductive volume, as well as the lack of correlation to recruitment, are valuable for the understanding of flounder ecology in the Baltic Sea, and for developing the management of the species. ¬© 2012 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,,Scopus,K,Baltic Sea - CS,">100,000",multidecadal,"500-1,000",day,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey,NA,2,2,3,Flounder reproductive volume is driven by the temporal dynamics of saltwater inflows into the Baltic Sea,NA,Platichthys flesus,"early life stages (eggs, larvae)",Salinity,Reproduction,NA,No response,Small,"This study demonstrates that both SSB and reproductive volume are significant factors in determining flounder ichthyoplankton abundance in the Central Baltic, but that the effect of larval supply on recruitment seems to be weak.

The larvae and early juveniles were not only collected in the same geographical area they were also of the same size (range 15-43 mm standard length, LS), similar ages and were collected during the same seasons (May to July). Although the two clupeid species experienced very similar environmental conditions, there were significant discrepancies in the analysed relationships. The otolith growth of larval and juvenile smelt was very strongly related to somatic growth while temperature had a minor effect. In herring, the effect of somatic growth, although clearly visible and statistically highly significant, was of less importance than temperature. Furthermore, variation in the otolith size and LS relationship was affected by temperature and somatic growth in both species, but the variance of otolith size at LS was higher for herring than for smelt. Although growth backcalculation from otoliths can presently be recommended as an appropriate method for use with both smelt and herring (despite possibly lower precision and accuracy with the latter), other methods referring directly to short-term increment width changes (e.g. marginal increment analysis) are recommended for smelt but not for herring. ¬© 2006 The Author.",English,Article,,Scopus,K,Baltic Sea - non CS,"50,000-100,000",two year,"50,000-100,000",two month,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey,GLM,1,1,3,It is reasonable to expect that the discrepancy between somatic and otolith growth depends not only on the magnitude of the factors affecting somatic growth and metabolic rate (temperature and feeding conditions) but that it might also be species specific.,NA,Clupea harengus,"early life stages (eggs, larvae)",Temperature,Growth,NA,Overall positive response,Large,NA,TEMPERATURE

The isotope ratios in C. pengoi and fish were much higher than those of zooplankton, showing general trends of enrichment with trophic level. Young-of-the-year (YOY) herring had a significantly higher 15N/14N ratio than C. pengoi, suggesting of a trophic linkage between the two species. To evaluate the possible relative importance of different food sources for C. pengoi and YOY herring, two-source isotope-mixing models for N were used, with micro- and mesozooplankton as prey for C. pengoi and mesozooplankton and C. pengoi as prey for YOY herring. These models indicate that mesozooplankton was the major food source of both species. However, microzooplankton may be important prey for young stages of C. pengoi. Comparative analyses of the herring trophic position before and after the invasion by C. pengoi showed a trophic level shift from 2.6 to 3.4, indicating substantial alterations in the food web structure.

The abundance of P. longirostris showed a clear increasing trend, significantly correlated with the fishing effort index (number of days at sea per month), the sea surface temperature and the wind-mixing index. The temporal variations in the stock of P. longirostris, which has a preference for warm waters, were positively correlated with the rise of the sea surface temperature and the decrease of wind circulation.

Depth, temperature and salinity data were combined with biological data on abundance, biomass, and fish size, to establish the ranges of bottom depth, temperature and salinity over which red mullet are distributed. Despite their distribution overlap, depth and temperature selection differed considerably between the size classes of the species. In general, fish size increased with depth, and smaller individuals tended to occur in shallower and warmer water. Abundance increased in mid-shelf waters during spring, indicating a movement across the shelf towards deeper water, associated with the spawning behaviour of the species. The factor controlling the timing of that movement to deep water seems to be the maturity of individual fish. Stomach content analysis revealed that red mullet fed mainly on benthic invertebrates, and that each size class consumed a narrow range of prey species. However, the composition of the prey consumed varied considerably with fish size and there were differences in mean prey size for each size class. Trophic diversity was low and decreased significantly with fish size, but in general was not affected by season. Intra-specific differences in preference and utilization of prey are related to the distribution patterns of the size classes. In particular, younger individuals exhibited the most restricted distribution and appeared to have a broader trophic niche than the larger size classes that occurred over a wider depth range. ¬© 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Maturity, defined by the triggering of vitellogenesis or milt production, was a function of both length and age. Proportions of mature individuals in 1-year-old males increased successively from almost zero in length classes below 15 cm to around 0.9 at 25 cm, whilst almost all 2-year-old males were mature from their smallest length of around 19 cm. Maturity in females was more strongly linked to age than to length. Most 1-year-old females were immature, the proportion of mature individuals not exceeding 0.3 in any length class. Most 2-year-old females were mature and immature fish were found in the smallest length classes only (20-25 cm). Almost all 3-year-olds of both sexes were mature in all length classes. Proportions of mature individuals in 1-year-olds increased substantially after 1997, particularly in males. Significant positive cross-correlation between proportion mature and mean length was found for 1-year-olds of both sexes. Length at 50% maturity (L50) averaged around 19 cm in males and 22 cm in females. Variability in L50 was negatively cross-correlated with average sea surface temperature in the preceding year. There is no evidence for substantial changes in maturity of whiting since the 1950s, despite an order-of-magnitude reduction in biomass caused by high fishing mortality. Concomitant decreases in mean length-at-age and weight-at-age in recent decades indicate that conditions may have been unfavourable for compensatory changes in maturation.

These trends have no apparent link with fishing pressure, although the latter has been increasing since the late 2000s. As part of an effort to develop suitable assessment and management tools for this stock, we investigated the life-history traits of sardine and analyze its seasonal and inter-annual variations. Based on 14 years of morphometric data from both scientific surveys and professional samples, we analyzed the variability in sardine body condition and its responses to environmental changes. Generalized Additive Models revealed an age-sex specific decreasing trend in body length over the study period, with most of the variability explained by the age class. Linear Mixed Effect Models applied to the body condition evidenced its strong seasonality and an age class specific decreasing trend. Regardless of age class, maximal body condition is reached at the end summer, after the spawning and plankton productive periods. Overall, annual trends in body condition-at-age showed remarkable coherence, with a significant decrease since 2007 for all age classes, suggesting that factors influencing body condition operate at population level. The shift in sardine body condition towards lower values could be broken down into three periods, with a high dependence on surface Chlorophyll-a and sea surface temperature. However, this study highlights that the period supporting the main decrease in body condition is characterized by high Chlorophyll-a, the available proxy for food, which is counterintuitive. Such a result suggests more complex trophic responses involving secondary production, with potential shift in the timing of the production and/or the quality of the food. At the population level, those changes may have a long-term negative effect, with a decrease in body length and important changes in phenology (length at first maturity, reproductive phenology) and potential consequences on sardine population dynamics in the Bay of Biscay. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,K,Western Waters - CS,">100,000",decade,"5,000-10,000",month,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey,GAM _ LM,2,2,3,"Over the study period, the magnitude of the decline in sardine body condition appears  different among age classes and depends upon year.",NA,Sardina pilchardus,juv and adults,Plankton,Condition,NA,Overall negative response,Medium,"The shift in sardine body condition towards lower values could be broken down into three periods, with a

Egg characteristics of 209 egg batches (covering ICES subdivisions (SD) 22‚Äì29 in the brackish water Baltic Sea) was used to reveal the significance of egg diameter and egg dry weight for egg specific gravity (ESG), subpopulations, and egg survival probabilities of pelagic eggs following a major saline water inflow event.

The results confirm the significance of ESG for egg survival and show that variability in ESG as and adaptation to salinity is determined mainly by water content manifested as differences in egg diameter; increase in diameter with decreasing salinity for pelagic eggs, and decreased diameter resulting in demersal eggs. ¬© 2017 The Authors",English,Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,K,Baltic Sea - CS,">100,000",five year,NA,subday,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey,"ANOVA, GLM, Multiple Regression Analysis",3,2,3,NA,NA,Platichthys flesus,"early life stages (eggs, larvae)",Salinity,Survival,NA,Overall positive response,Medium,Different response for two spawning types (now species) of flounder - pelagic and demersal,CLIMATE & OCEANOGRAPHY

Comparative analyses of models with and without linkages among indicators showed that for both types of indicators, linkages corresponding to predator-prey feedbacks and intra-specific density-dependence were essential to explain temporal variation in the indicators. Thus, no indicator-pressure relationships could be found that explained the indicators‚Äô variation unless such linkages were accounted for. When accounting for these, we found that the indicators overall respond to multiple pressures acting simultaneously rather than to single pressures, as no pressure alone could explain how the indicators developed over time. The manageable pressures fishing and eutrophication, as well as the prevailing hydrological conditions influenced by climate, were all needed to reproduce the inter-annual changes in these food-web indicators combined, although individual relationships differed between the indicators. We conclude that our innovative indicator-testing framework can therefore be used to identify responses of food-web indicators to manageable pressures while accounting for the biotic interactions in food-webs linking such indicators. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,,Scopus,K,Baltic Sea - CS,">100,000",multidecadal,NA,year,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey,multivariate autoregressive models,3,3,3,NA,NA,Sprattus sprattus,juv and adults,Temperature,Abundance,NA,Overall positive response,NA,NA,TEMPERATURE

Lipophilic substances are measured in remarkable concentrations especially in the fatty parts of fish, such as herring (Clupea harengus). However, less lipophilic POPs, e.g. perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), can also be detected. For the first time to our knowledge, this study provides a broad range of contaminant concentrations simultaneously measured in filet, liver, and gonads of both sexes of Baltic herring. We analysed organochlorines, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and PFCs in mature autumn-spawning individuals and found distinct organ pollutant pattern for all POPs in both sexes. POP concentrations found in the gonads of both sexes indicate that not only females but also males tend to reduce contaminants via reproduction. However, sex-dependent differences could be identified for hexachlorobenzene, PBDEs, and were most remarkable for PFCs. This transfer of contaminants to the gonads in both male and female herring is being underestimated, as it may directly affect the general reproduction success as well as the healthy development of the next generation. Hence, the accumulation of contaminants in the gonads should be considered one possible threat to a healthy wildlife as its achievement is stated by the Baltic Sea Action Plan. Inclusion of a periodic monitoring of POP concentrations in gonads of fish may be an important bioeffect measure to assess the environmental status of biota in the Baltic Sea. ¬© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",English,Article,,Scopus,K,Baltic Sea - CS,"50,000-100,000",month,NA,NA,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey,inear mixed effect models ,1,1,2,NA,Data only from one month,Clupea harengus,adults,Contaminants & Pollution,Reproduction,NA,Overall negative response,NA,NA,ABIOTIC ANTHROPIC

Such larval transport has been suggested to be an important mechanism behind the commonly observed low spatial genetic differentiation in many marine organisms. Here, we apply an ARMAX(2,2) model for juvenile abundance and use long-term monitoring data from the Skagerrak coast, constituting 54 continuous annual series from 1945 to 1997. Analysing the model, we find that the product of the size of the North Sea breeding stock and the strength of the net inflow of North Sea waters had a significant, positive effect on the abundance of coastal juvenile cod. The peak effect occurs during the month of March, just after spawning, when eggs and larvae remain pelagic and sensitive to currents. In contrast, we find no evidence of any direct effect of the North Sea spawning stock alone. Our analyses indicate that 15-20 000 0-group larvae from the North Sea reach each fjord per year, on average. This corresponds to about 1-10% of the total 0-group population in each fjord on average.

Field studies indicate that egg mortality can be very high (up to 100%) in eggs that are attached to red algae (Rajasilta et al., 1989, 1993). Because high mortality can be due to allelochemical effects of the algae, we studied the mortality of herring eggs on different algal substrates experimentally. Four types of substrates were tested: fresh Cladophora and Furcellaria, and Furcellaria that had decomposed six days or 23 days. The incubation time in the experiments was 3 days and incubation temperature 12-13 oC (ca. 700-800 h-degrees). The results were in accordance with observations made in field studies and indicated significant differences among the substrate types. In eggs attached to fresh Cladophora, mortality was significantly lower (mean=2.8%; n=20) than in those attached to Furcellaria, independently of the treatment of the algae. The highest values of mortality (mean=14.4%; n=20) were found in eggs attached to Furcellaria that had decomposed over a six days' period. This suggested that Furcellaria contain some chemical substances, which can cause mortality in herring embryos and the effect seems to be dependent on the state of decomposition of the algae. ¬© Springer 2006.",English,Conference Paper,,Scopus,K,Baltic Sea - CS,0-5,week,NA,subday,Behavioural Observations,non-parametric tests.,1,2,2,NA,NA,Clupea harengus,"early life stages (eggs, larvae)",Other,Survival,NA,Overall positive response,NA,Positive effect on mortality on fresh Furcellaria algae,Other

Analysis of egg and larval abundance and birthdates based on the otoliths of mackerel juveniles caught between July and October 2000 showed that there were no survivors from the early spring spawns, indicating a massive loss of early spawning effort. Moreover, the abundance of 1-year-old mackerel estimated from an acoustic survey carried out in 2001 was the lowest observed within the 1999-2008 time series. This low or null survival from the early spawns in 2000 could be due to the meteorological and oceanographic conditions of that spring, in particular two storm events in April after a relatively calm March. The first storm event from the north caused strong local wind in the southern Bay of Biscay but a weak oceanographic response. The second storm event from the southwest was mainly felt west of Galicia and caused a notable increase in shelf currents and a shift of the hydrographical structure along the shelf. Detailed analysis of strong wind pulses in early spring within the historical recruitment record suggests that strong local turbulence generated by high wind speeds and advection of larvae caused by the enhancement of shelf currents can contribute to reduced recruitment.

However, a recent study has shown that this is not likely. In the light of this study, a review of the history of mackerel spawning in the North Sea found that the traditional explanation of the collapse did not account for a range of unfavourable environmental changes: high fishing pressure was followed by decreasing temperatures that reduced the spawning migration into the North Sea. This was further supplemented by unfavourable changes in food and wind-induced turbulence.

Understanding variability in recruitment can reveal mechanisms behind widespread decline in the abundance of key species in marine and terrestrial ecosystems.

Matching management actions to the scale of biological processes is therefore important for sustainable fisheries management. This study examined the adequacy and appropriate scale of a spatially explicit management regime for sandeel, Ammodytes marinus, in the North Sea. Information from biophysical model simulations of larval transport and otolith chemistry was used to estimate the scale of mixing among aggregations. Together, these approaches indicated that there was negligible exchange of pre-settled sandeel among aggregations >200 km apart. Additionally, a re-analysis of tag-recapture experiments and distribution data indicated that the dispersive range decreased further after settlement. Significant differences in length at maturity and year-class strength not only reflect the limited mixing across the North Sea, but also point to regional differences in productivity and thereby vulnerability to fishing pressure. We conclude that the current management regime comprised of multiple assessment areas enable these differences to be considered in advice on annual fishing quotas. ¬© Crown copyright 2019.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,K,North Sea - CS,">100,000",decade,"5,000-10,000",NA,Simulated dynamics,individual-based modelling framework IBMlib,3,3,3,NA,NA,Ammodytes,juv and adults,Hydrodynamics & winds,Abundance,NA,Overall positive response,NA,Larval  transport,CLIMATE & OCEANOGRAPHY

A laboratory experiment was performed to investigate how the vulnerability to predation of metamorphosing plaice was affected by the presence of filamentous algae. Predation by shrimps (Crangon crangon) on settling plaice larvae was higher on sand than among algae, whereas predation by crabs (Carcinus maenas) was unaffected by habitat type, suggesting a lower overall mortality of plaice in the vegetated habitat. When predators and prey were presented with a combination of the two habitats, predation by shrimps was as high as that in the sand treatment alone, whereas predation by crabs was lower than that in the two treatments with one habitat. Based on these results, an additional experiment was performed, investigating the functional response of shrimps to six densities of juvenile plaice in a sand habitat with alternative prey present. The proportional mortality of juvenile plaice (12-16 mm total length (TL)) was density-dependent and was best described by a type III (sigmoid) functional response of the predatory shrimps. The results suggested that the combined predation pressure from shrimps and crabs was lower among algae than on sand, but settling plaice and predatory shrimps chose the sand habitat. Plaice densities in the sigmoid part of the obtained functional response curve represented normal to high field densities of plaice on the Swedish west coast, suggesting that shrimp predation could have a stabilising effect on plaice recruitment. The formation of macroalgae mats could therefore lead to a concentration of plaice juveniles in the remaining sand habitat and increased mortality through density-dependent predation by shrimps. ¬© 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

At the height of the outbreak infection rates and mortality rates were about 0.4 year(-1) and 1.5 year(-1), respectively. Parameterization of infection rate as a year-class and age effect was more complex and did not provide a better fit than a year and age parameterization. The impact of I. hoferi on the North Sea herring stock was estimated to be significant but not catastrophic.

Such inshore spawning grounds are ecologically important by providing suitable substrates for demersal egg deposition. These habitats are often highly impacted by multiple anthropogenic threats. Decades of eutrophication have caused a decline in depth distribution of submerged aquatic vegetation, the main herring spawning substrate in the Baltic Sea. Nowadays, spawning beds are limited to the shallow littoral zone (‚â§3¬†m depth). Accordingly, macrophytes are increasingly exposed to mechanic forcing due to storm-induced wave action. Generally, reproductive success and year class strength of the Western Baltic herring population is strongly determined by the survival of early life stages such as eggs and larvae in local nursery areas. However, explicit mechanisms by which local stressors might affect overall recruitment are currently not well understood. Hypothesizing that aquatic vegetation limited by water depth causes high herring egg mortality due to increased exposure to storm-induced hydrodynamics, we performed a combination of field studies investigating the impact of storm events on herring egg loss. Results of an egg loss experiment revealed a total egg loss of 29% in one single spawning bed during a storm event within the spawning season and the quantification of eggs attached to macrophyte litter on the shoreline emphasize the potential for regional weather extremes such as storm events to act as influential stressors for herring reproduction. ¬© 2017, Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.",English,Article,,Scopus,K,Baltic Sea - CS,"1,000-5,000",two month,"1,000-5,000",week,Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey,ANOVA,2,2,3,local stressors negatively affect the population dynamics at higher spatial scales,NA,Clupea harengus,"early life stages (eggs, larvae)",Hydrodynamics & winds,Survival,"F _ p, wind",Overall positive response,Large,NA,CLIMATE & OCEANOGRAPHY

Relating these thresholds, in a cause-and-effect manner, to long-term changes in the vital rates (e.g. growth, survival, reproduction) of wild populations has the potential to generate robust science advice needed to support conservation efforts. Here we investigate the hypothesis that the decreasing annual productivity (i.e. larval and juvenile abundances) of Western Baltic Spring-Spawning (WBSS) herring over the last decade is linked to warmer springs exceeding the physiological optimum of early life stages. First, we used laboratory experiments to identify the optimal and arrhythmia-inducing temperatures for cardiac function in herring larvae (approx. 16 ¬∞C and 21 ¬∞C, respectively), which were not significantly influenced by rearing temperature (7, 11 or 15 ¬∞C). These laboratory results matched well the decreased growth rates determined in the wild for larvae at temperatures beyond 17 ¬∞C. Second, we calculated a thermal threshold index based on the number of days above the optimal 16 ¬∞C threshold during the herring spawning time (March-June), which significantly increased from 1992 to 2017 for a major spawning ground of WBSS herring. Over the same time period, the thermal threshold index was significantly correlated to decreased annual productivity of WBSS herring. This finding suggests that warming is at least partially responsible for the steady decline in annual productivity of this population over the past decade. This study adds to the growing body of evidence that physiological measurements can be used as indicators of population resilience, and that the knowledge gained from laboratory experiments can be translated into advice for effective single-species (and eventually ecosystem-based) conservation and management. ¬© 2020 The Authors",English,Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,K,Baltic Sea - CS,NA,month,N/A,month,Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey,Theil-Sen regression,2,2,3,warming is at least partially responsible for the steady decline in annual productivity of this population over the past decade,NA,Clupea harengus,adults,Temperature,Reproduction,p,Overall positive response,Large,NA,TEMPERATURE

The microstructure of the sagittal otoliths of 427 individuals from 64 sampling sites were analysed to determine the day of first feeding (DFF) and the growth history of YoY survivors. DFF distributions differed markedly between Baltic areas, with a shift to later mean DFFs and narrower distributions from west to northeast. This was consistent with the shift in mean seasonal spawning effort of Baltic sprat, derived from long-term observations (1973 to 2002) of sprat egg abundance in these areas. Otolith growth trajectories (i.e. increment width-at-age) had a characteristic shape related to sampling area and, more importantly, to the time of the year at which the individual started feeding (DFF). During the larval stage, individuals from the northeastern area and those born later in the year had higher growth rates than their earlier born conspecifics, while the pattern was reversed during the juvenile stage. Weekly means of satellite-based sea-surface temperature were used to approximate the potential temperature history of YoY survivors, which significantly influenced the shape of the otolith growth trajectory.

We conducted laboratory incubation experiments and video observations to quantify feeding rates on Baltic cod eggs and larvae. Ingestion rates increased with cod larvae concentrations up to 8 prey L-1, beyond which ingestion remained constant. Neither Mnemiopsis size nor egg concentration (1-16 prey L -1) affected feeding rates on cod eggs. Observed feeding rates pooled from all experiments conducted at nonsaturating prey concentrations were low, with the highest volume-specific clearance on &lt; 4.5-d-old yolk-sac larvae (0.05 ¬± 0.02 L (mL Mnemiopsis)-1 h-1), and lower rates on 4.5-8-d-old larvae (0.02 ¬± 0.02 L (mL Mnemiopsis)-1 h-1) and eggs (0.02 ¬± 0.03 L (mL Mnemiopsis)-1 h-1). When offered Artemia salina and cod eggs simultaneously, Mnemiopsis passively selected against cod eggs. Video recordings showed that eggs did not trigger the capture response that Mnemiopsis shows toward motile prey, and ingested eggs were often ejected (88%, n = 8). Applying our clearance rates to in situ abundances of cod eggs, larvae, and Mnemiopsis for the peak of the spawning season, we demonstrate that the predation pressure of the invasive ctectenophore is negligible.

We hypothesize that condition of recruits should increase when recruitment failures are caused by fishing activity. This would be a consequence of the increase in trophic resource availability, because the population is smaller than that which the ecosystem could support. Temporal series of hake recruit condition were calculated from MEDITS survey data collected in Mediterranean geographical sub-areas (GSAs) 1, 6, 17 and 19 from 1994 to 2015. Multiple linear regressions were used to analyse the relationship between mean annual condition and abundance of recruits and climatic indices in each GSA. Significant correlations were only detected in GSA 6, where 69% of condition variability was explained by the negative correlation with recruit abundance, and with two climatic indices, the Western Mediterranean Oscillation and the standardized air temperature anomaly at surface from the Gulf of Lions. Despite the differences in recruit abundance among GSAs, their mean annual condition oscillated around the same basal value during most of the time series, pointing to density-dependent mortality rates as an important mechanism stabilizing hake recruitment to levels close to the carrying capacity when populations do not suffer recruitment overfishing. This pattern changed when the decreasing recruit abundance trend drove GSA 6 condition values persistently above those of the rest of the GSAs.

Samples were collected in August/September of the years 2009, 2010 and 2011 in the north-eastern part of the central North Sea. Prey selection was assessed by identification of individual prey items in the stomach content to species.

For each group, growth patterns were estimated based on measures of otolith growth increments. The stomach contents showed that cod as a species are opportunistic in their prey selection, but at the same time indicated that the total, broad feeding niche width of the population is dominated by individual diet specialization and that many individuals temporally show a preference for a particular prey type. The contribution of invertebrates and particularly crustaceans decreased with increasing cod size, whereas that of fish and predominantly herring increased. Prey type had a significant effect on growth, while temperature had no effect. Slowest growth was observed in the cod group preying on sandeel, while cod preying on Norway pout showed the fastest growth.

In the present study, we investigated the hypothesis that the availability of the large copepods determines food consumption and growth conditions of lesser sandeel (Ammodytes marinus) in the North Sea. Analysis of stomach content suggested that food consumption is higher for fish feeding on large copepods, and additional calculations revealed how handling time limitation may provide part of the explanation for this relationship. Comparing stomach data and zooplankton samples indicated that lesser sandeel actively target large copepods when these are available. Finally, we observed that the length of lesser sandeel began to decrease in the late 1980s, simultaneously with the C. finmarchicus decline. ¬© 2013 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

A prohibition on fishing in 1999 was followed by a short-term recovery of stock biomass, but then a sustained decline to very low levels of abundance.

There was no clear relationship between survival of young stages of herring and the abundance of Calanus finmarchicus but the year class strength of 0-wr and 1-wr had a negative relationship to bottom water temperature.

This has usually been attributed to a top-down process, i.e. to the simultaneous collapse of cod stocks and their predation. We present long-term data for 1980 to 1993 showing that bottom-up effects may also have played a role: along with the decline of salinity, the biomass proportion of zooplankton taxa preferred by herring (larger than 20 Œºg ind-1 in wet weight) significantly declined. To support our hypothesis we present a study in which Baltic herring feeding and selective predation were investigated during 1985, a time of good growth and high weight-at-age, and 1991, when herring growth and weight-at-age were poor. In this study, herring stomachs and simultaneously taken plankton samples were analysed from trawl surveys conducted in the northern Baltic proper during the peak of the herring feeding season in late summer. During both 1985 and 1991, herring selectively preyed on the larger zooplankton categories, especially neritic copepods. However, in 1991, a smaller proportion of the prey in herring stomachs consisted of neritic copepods, apparently because their share in plankton had decreased. Consequently, and despite an increase in total zooplankton biomass, the estimated carbon content of the food eaten by herring was lower, and the average stomach fullness index (on a scale of 0 to 5) decreased from 3.9 in 1985 to 1.9 in 1991. Also, the amount of mesenteric fat on herring stomachs declined from 4.2 to 3.2 (scale 0 to 5), indicating a longer-term failure in feeding success.

While EBFM considers the effect of fishing at the ecosystem level, it generally struggles with climate-driven environmental variability. In this study we show that the position of a fish stock within its distributional range or thermal niche (we use Icelandic and North Sea cod as examples of stocks at the centre and edge of their niche, respectively) will influence the relative importance of fishing and climate on abundance. At the warmer edge of the thermal niche of cod in the North Sea, we show a prominent influence of climate on the cod stock that is mediated through temperature effects on the plankton. In contrast, the influence of climate through its effects on plankton appears much less important at the present centre of the niche around Iceland. Recognising the potentially strong effect of climate on fish stocks, at a time of rapid global climate change, is probably an important prerequisite towards the synthesis of a cod management strategy. ¬© Inter-Research 2010.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,K,North Sea - CS,">100,000",multidecadal,">100,000",year,Fisheries Dependent Data,Correlation analyses,2,2,2,Correlation between plankton index and cod recruitment at age 1 in North Sea is highly positive. ,NA,Gadus morhua,juveniles,Plankton,Reproduction,NA,Overall positive response,Large,"r = 0,68; note the paper is about more than the interaction between cod recruitment and zooplankton, there is also a significant negative effect between temperature and plankton index",FOOD

Reproductive investment within the western North Sea haddock sub-population significantly increased between the 1970s and 2000s, as was evident from both a decline in maturation probability and an increase in fecundity with size. A decline in maturation probability was also evident in males from the east North Sea, although the length at 50% probability of maturing (Lp50) at the beginning and end of the study period was much higher than in the west North Sea. The changes in reproductive traits could not be explained as a compensatory response, since the trend for increasing reproductive investment was not reversed when the North Sea stock recovered over the past decade. Indeed increased reproductive investment was accompanied by a reduction in somatic growth rate. Temperature immediately prior to secondary gametogenesis could partially explain inter-annual variation in female maturation probability and may have influenced the difference in sub-population trends. However, declines in maturation probability with cohort were still highly significant after accounting for a temperature effect, and differences in potential fecundity could not be explained by changes in somatic condition.

The Gotland Basin spawning ground is one of three main spawning areas of Baltic cod, Gadus morhua Linnaeus, 1758. The threshold water parameters for cod development are the salinity exceeding 11‚Ä∞ and the oxygen level above 2 mL¬∑ L‚Äì1. Such conditions are only present when the 11‚Ä∞ isohaline is above the 2 mL¬∑ L‚Äì1 isooxygen. In such situation the water volume between the isolines is called the ‚Äúsuitable reproduction volume‚Äù. When the position of the isolines is reversed, the salinity and the oxygen level of the water layer demarcated by them are below the required thresholds and as such the water is unsuitable for the cod development. We refer to it as the ‚Äúunsuitable reproduction volume‚Äù. The main aim of the presently reported study was to examine whether variations in suitable and unsuitable reproduction habitat estimates could explain the fl uctuations in cod recruitment. Material and methods. The suitable and unsuitable reproduction volumes in the Gotland Basin were estimated based on single point observations at three oceanographic monitoring stations using the contouring software Balthypsograph. To test the spatial hydrological heterogeneity in the Gotland Basin we used 15 observations during 1969‚Äì1995 on four stations in each of two transects. The oceanographic monitoring and demersal trawl research survey data from 1974‚Äì2012 have been used in analyses. Results. The sufficient reproduction conditions in the southern Gotland Basin persisted only until 1981. In later decades the reproduction potential of the Gotland Basin has decreased. The latest major North Sea water infl ows in 1993 and 2003 in the Central Gotland Basin formed the suitable reproduction volume below the layers where cod eggs are fl oating. A significant relation between the recruit abundance and suitable and the unsuitable reproduction volumes was found only for the Southern Gotland Basin (P &lt; 0.03). Conclusions. We demonstrated that single-point estimates sufficiently quantify the reproduction conditions in the Gotland Basin and thus can be used for estimation of the reproduction volumes. The unsuitable reproduction volume concept can be used as an ecological indicator for egg survival probability in the Gotland Basin. However, it is too premature to re-define the concept of the suitable reproduction volume because it is applicable only to the Gotland spawning ground. ¬© 2005, Scientific Society of Szczecin.

Identifying changes to phenology, the timing of biological events, and understanding their effect on recruitment and abundance is of critical importance to establish potential population effects. We examined the larval phenology of the commercially important Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) and used a larval transport model to examine its effect on simulated transport patterns. Using a model to estimate annual larval release dates based on temperature-dependent embryo incubation, an earlier shift of 17.2 d occurred between 1982‚Äì1995 and 2000‚Äì2010 in the Irish Sea, similar to an observed empirical shift in phenology of 19.1 d using historical zooplankton data sets. Despite this earlier phenology, temperature-dependent pelagic larval durations were unchanged because the water column to which larvae were released earlier had also warmed. Larval transport simulations in the western Irish Sea indicated that the phenology shift had minimal effects on larval retention and advection distance overall, because major variations were observed only at very early or late stages of the larval season, that is, times when lower proportions of larvae were present. As the western Irish Sea grounds exports small but consistent quantities of larvae to nearby populations, especially off Scotland, it may act as an important source of larvae, especially when retention of native larvae is low. Overall, larval transport tools may indicate grounds that are periodically vulnerable to recruitment failures and offer potentially valuable information in fishery management. ¬© 2020 The Authors.

The two areas, with different oceanographic conditions, were respectively located in the northwest (S√≥ller) and the south (Cabrera) of Mallorca. Off S√≥ller, feeding intensity of A. antennatus showed a significant increase from February to April and June 2004 in all the three size-classes studied (small shrimps: CL < 30 mm; medium: CL between 30 and 40 mm; large: CL ‚â• 40 mm). Off Cabrera, the highest fullness was recorded in November 2003 among small and medium shrimp, while only large specimens showed patterns similar to that found off S√≥ller. Off S√≥ller, the diet of both small (CL < 34 mm) and large (CL ‚â• 34 mm) A. antennatus was mainly influenced by season, with three dietary groups corresponding to August-September 2003, to November 2003/February 2004, and to hauls from April to June 2004. Off Cabrera, hauls (representing diets) were grouped by depth, never by season. The most remarkable seasonal shift in the diet of A. antennatus off S√≥ller was the increase of mesopelagic prey in April-June relative to other months. In all size categories there was an increase off S√≥ller in the energy intake of prey ingested from February to June 2004, an increase not found off Cabrera. Degree of digestion of mesopelagic prey indicated nocturnal feeding on mesopelagic fauna. These prey probably have a shallower depth distribution at night than found in our daylight sampling, and possible migratory movements among prey and A. antennatus at night would explain the lack of correlation between prey abundance in guts and in the environment found during daylight periods for most micronekton mesopelagic prey (euphausiids, myctophids and sergestids). Off S√≥ller, fullness and diet were significantly linked to temporal changes in water column productivity (e.g., Chl a readings, fluorescence) and to changes in the shrimp biology (lipid content of hepatopancreas, Gonado-somatic Index, GSI). Off Cabrera, we found a higher dependence of fullness and diet with T and S, both variables in turn related to depth. The increase of stomach fullness and dietary energy intake in pre-reproductive females from February to April-June 2004 found off S√≥ller, coupled with the consumption of mesopelagic prey, was parallel to a significant increase of the gonad weight (GSI, fecundity) in June. Most individuals attain gonad development in the period May-June, after two months of the peak of primary production at the surface. The strong link found between pelagic resources and reproductive processes in a deep-sea species such as the shrimp Aristeus antennatus, situated near the top of the trophic web, suggests a rapid energy flow via mesopelagic fauna between surface primary production and bathyal megabenthic communities at oligotrophic insular areas. In contrast to mainland areas off the Catalan coasts submitted to the influence of submarine canyons, around the island of Mallorca the empoverishment of benthos biomass may enhance consumption of micronektonic prey and a possible accumulation of pre-reproductive females of A. antennatus in areas (e.g., steep slopes and persistent frontal systems found off S√≥ller) with high zooplankton aggregations. ¬© 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

At the same time, the most important commercial fish population of the region, the eastern Baltic cod, has experienced a drastic reduction in mean body condition, but the processes behind the relation between deoxygenation and condition remain elusive. Here we use extensive long-Term monitoring data on cod biology and distribution as well as on hydrological variations to investigate the processes that relate deoxygenation and cod condition during the autumn season. Our results show that the depth distribution of cod has increased during the past 4 decades at the same time of the expansion, and shallowing, of waters with oxygen concentrations detrimental to cod performance. This has resulted in a progressively increasing spatial overlap between the cod population and low-oxygenated waters after the mid-1990s. This spatial overlap and the actual oxygen concentration experienced by cod therein statistically explained a large proportion of the changes in cod condition over the years. These results complement previous analyses on fish otolith microchemistry that also revealed that since the mid-1990s, cod individuals with low condition were exposed to low-oxygen waters during their life. This study helps to shed light on the processes that have led to a decline of the eastern Baltic cod body condition, which can aid the management of this population currently in distress. Further studies should focus on understanding why the cod population has moved to deeper waters in autumn and on analyzing the overlap with low-oxygen waters in other seasons to quantify the potential effects of the variations in physical properties on cod biology throughout the year. ¬© Author(s) 2021.

Density dependence implies that the function linking the count of a cohort in one year to the count in the succeeding year is convex. The method estimates (without functional assumptions) the function linking the two counts and provides a level of significance for any convexity. We investigate the power and bias of the new test on the basis of simulated data. The power compares well with a test of unit slope in a log-log plot (although it is usually somewhat lower). However, in contrast to the latter method, the test for convexity is much more resistant to measurement error. We applied the model to long-term survey data from two areas of the Norwegian Skagerrak coast. In both cases, the variance is intermediate between the Gamma (variance proportional to the squared mean) and the Poisson (variance proportional to the mean) distributions. A negative binomial (with k ‚âÉ 3.5) describes the variance well. The variance is interpreted as resulting from sampling errors, spatial heterogeneity, and environmental stochasticity. Incorporating this error structure, the optimal models linking the two main juvenile stages are, for each area, nonlinear and significantly convex (P < 0.05). The full models are highly significant (P < 0.001), and the examination of the residuals does not reveal any remaining structure. We conclude that the survival of juvenile cod along the Norwegian Skagerrak coast is density dependent, probably because of cannibalism, competition for habitat, and food limitation.

The major stock, the eastern Baltic cod, has decreased substantially during the last decade. A discussion concerning the possibility of immigration of cod and the potential of stock interactions has evolved. The present study was conducted in order to elucidate if differences in salinity requirements for successful spawning exist between the eastern Baltic cod and the western Belt Sea cod, and if adaptation to ambient salinity is possible. Activation of the spermatozoa occurred at ‚â§11 to 12 psu (practical salinity units) for Baltic cod and at ‚â§15 to 16 psu for Belt Sea cod. Neutral egg buoyancy was obtained at 14.5 ¬± 1.2 psu and at 20 to 22 psu respectively. Transfer of fish from marine to brackish water conditions showed that these characteristics remained essentially the same; activation of spermatozoa occurred at ‚â§14 to 15 psu and neutral egg buoyancy at 19 to 21 psu. The results suggest that these characteristics are specific to populations. Regarding hydrographic conditions in the spawning areas of cod in the Baltic, the results suggest that stock interactions may be possible in the western Baltic spawning areas where salinity requirements for both stocks are fulfilled, but not in the eastern spawning areas as low salinity prevents successful spawning of Belt Sea cod. Salinity and oxygen conditions in the Baltic vary with highly irregular saline water inflows.

In order to assess these impacts, phenotypic and genotypic data pertaining to young-of-the-year (YOY) sole (Solea solea) were screened in differentially contaminated North East Atlantic estuaries ranging from Portugal (Mondego) to the English Channel (Seine). YOY sole inhabiting each estuary was found being phenotypically distinct from each other; each of them being impacted by pollution when comparing observed phenotypic data with published literature. According to the strong pollution in the Seine estuary, the corresponding YOY sole sample showed significantly lower body mass, size and condition factor compared to other samples. Using fifteen genetic markers, the Mondego estuary demonstrated low, but significant levels of genetic differentiation with most of the samples. Using neutrality tests, two loci were found to be putatively under directional selection (Soso7 and Soso23), but only locus Soso7 demonstrated significant positive heterozygosity-fitness correlation (HFC) for body size and body mass, suggesting a possible ongoing adaptive process. The candidate locus MT associated to a detoxifying metallothionein gene did not show significant genetic differentiation, but (i) significant deficit in heterozygote in the Seine estuary as already reported in other coastal samples impacted by metallic contaminants, and (ii) significant positive HFC with body mass were found. Selective rather than demographic processes better explain an observed genetic structure in YOY sole and are predominantly associated with the heavily contaminated Seine estuary whose nursery function and capacity are degraded. ¬© 2013 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,,Scopus,K,Western Waters - CS,">100,000",year,"5,000-10,000",year,Water analysis,Correlation,2,2,2,NA,NA,Solea solea,juveniles,Contaminants & Pollution,Growth,NA,Overall negative response,medium,NA,ABIOTIC ANTHROPIC

Growth (size and otolith daily increment width), body condition (morphometric index) and abundance of juvenile common soles were analysed together with xenobiotic concentrations (heavy metals and organic contaminants). Condition indices displayed important variations and did not allow relevant estimation of environmental quality. On the contrary, growth and density indicators showed good steadiness above years but varied among sites. In spite of difficulties of interpreting these indicators on such a meso-scale approach, analyses highlighted the estuaries of Seine and Gironde. In these nursery areas, the levels of contamination were especially high, and the combination of fish growth performances and density was significantly lower than in other sites. The combination of these variables appears to provide reliable indicators of habitat quality and anthropogenic pressure on nursery grounds, especially highlighting contaminated areas. Such indicators may thus contribute to improve assessment of environmental quality of essential fish habitats with the aim of a sustainable management of fisheries resources. A study at a different scale, from this meso-scale nursery approach with more precise analyses, on local habitats, will nevertheless be necessary to optimize the relevance of these indicators for the assessment of essential fish habitat quality. ¬© 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was therefore to investigate to which extent these fluctuations could be trophodynamically mediated. The trophic ecology of both fish species was characterised over three contrasting periods (spring 2010 and 2011 and autumn 2011) in the area, in relation to potential variation in the abundance and composition of the mesozooplankton resource. Stable isotope analyses of carbon (Œ¥13C) and nitrogen (Œ¥15N) were performed on potential mesozoplanktonic prey items and in the muscle of adult fish, as well as in the liver whenever available, and mixing models were applied. In both springs, the mesozooplankton resource was abundant but qualitatively different. During this period of the year, results based on muscle isotope values in particular showed that S. pilchardus and E. encrasicolus likely do not compete strongly for food. On the medium term, E. encrasicolus always presented a greater trophic plasticity than S. pilchardus, both in terms of feeding areas and in the size of the mesozooplanktonic prey consumed. In autumn, mesozooplankton abundances were lower, and it was likely that S. pilchardus and E. encrasicolus share food resources during this period. No clear links between the variation in the mesozooplanktonic resource and the trophic segregation maintained between adults of both fish species in spring could be made. Although a certain potential exists for trophodynamically mediated fluctuations of both species under specific abiotic conditions (i.e. due to the existing trophic segregation in spring in particular), the overall results suggest that fluctuations in abundance of both fish species are probably not directly linked to their trophic ecology in the Bay of Biscay, at least at the level of adult individuals. ¬© 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,K,Western Waters - CS,">100,000",two year,"5,000-10,000",month,Active Net Capture,Stable isotope analysis,2,2,2,NA,NA,Sardina pilchardus,adults,Prey availability,Abundance,NA,No response,NA,NA,FOOD

The sea-run Baltic salmon populations are affected by the M74 syndrome, an early life-stage mortality associated with low thiamine (vitamin B1) concentrations in the offspring. In order to study whether sea-run brown trout with symptoms and mortalities similar to M74 also suffer from low thiamine concentrations, analyses of thiamine were performed. Also, tissues of Baltic cod were analyzed for their content of thiamine. This study confirms that Baltic salmon that are affected by M74 suffer from low thiamine levels and that the temporal onset of the development of M74 may be correlated to the thiamine concentration in the eyed egg. Also, thiamine concentrations of muscle and ovaries from females that produced offspring with M74 were significantly lower than those of females that produced healthy progeny, which indicates that M74 may be a maternally transmitted thiamine deficiency. Preliminary data from sea-run Baltic brown trout showed that yolk-sac fry with symptoms that resembled those of M74 - lethargy, darkening of skin and 100% mortality - had low mean thiamine concentrations (0.14 nmol g-1 in 1994 and 0.34 in 1998) compared with those of healthy progeny (4.4 nmol g-1 in 1994 and 3.9 in 1998). This indicates that some family groups of Baltic brown trout may be affected by a reproduction disorder related to thiamine deficiency.

Stomach contents were examined for prey composition in order to evaluate the potential importance of the pelagic and demersal habitats for recruitment success. Juvenile cod less than 40 mm fed exclusively on pelagic prey such as copepods and cladocerans. Between 40 and 50 mm the juveniles began to consume benthic prey such as mysids and amphipods; however, copepods were still the dominant food organisms. Between 50 and 70 mm the dominant prey items consumed were mysids and amphipods, with copepods comprising a minor component of the diet. Between 70 and 160 mm the juveniles' diet was composed exclusively of benthic prey with an increase in prey diversity. Mysids were slightly less important in the diet, while the abundance of polychaetes, decapods and fish increased with fish size. Amphipods remained almost constant in the diet of juveniles above 60 mm in length. These results indicate that a major change in food resource utilization started to occur at a fish length of 40 mm, with the main change taking place at approximately 50 mm, suggesting that juvenile Baltic cod make the transition to the benthic habitat at this length. This change in food preference is also reflected in the size of the prey items and the numbers of prey consumed. Pelagic juveniles consumed much smaller prey than their demersal conspecifics. Neither prey size nor prey numbers consumed by pelagic and small demersal juveniles from this study differed from prey reported to be taken by juvenile cod of corresponding size in the Atlantic and the North Sea. However, prey organisms consumed by demersal juvenile Baltic cod larger than 90 mm were much smaller, and prey numbers much higher, than those reported to be consumed by juveniles in other areas.

Incubation in saltwater had no influence on the time of appearance of dead eggs, on the mean length of the fry at hatching, on the mean fry total-weight, body-weight, yolk sac-weight at hatching, or on the mean yolk sac/total weight ratio. Incubation in saltwater caused a delay in hatching and the duration of the hatching period was increased. For the salinity range found in the Baltic Sea, egg-to-fry survival decreased with increasing incubation salinity. The difference in survival from incubation in freshwater to saltwater was about 11%. Owing to the physico-chemical characteristics of the Baltic Sea, spawning in saltwater should be successful. The infrequent use of apparently good spawning areas in saltwater could be due to high vulnerability of these sites during winter storms. ¬© 1994.",English,Article,NA,Scopus,K,Baltic Sea - CS,5-Oct,two year,5-Oct,month,hatchery experiments,"ANOVA, LM",2,2,3,"For the salinity range found in the Baltic Sea, egg-to-fry survival decreased with increasing incubation salinity",NA,Salmo trutta,"early life stages (eggs, larvae)",Salinity,Survival,NA,Overall negative response,large,NA,CLIMATE & OCEANOGRAPHY

We suggest that the approach used in this study can find a much wider application in European waters. ¬© International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2018. All rights reserved.

Yet, the environmental factors that affect the growth of plaice remain unresolved. Here we examine the drivers of plaice growth variation by using a large archive of otoliths from female plaice collected in the northeastern part of the North Sea from 1993 to 2015, providing growth data over the period 1985-2014. We developed a series of increasingly complex mixed-effect models to explore intrinsic (within individual) and extrinsic (environmental factors: bottom temperature and plaice density) sources of growth variation. We analysed juvenile (0 and 1 year) and (sub)adult (‚â•2 years) growth separately due to different habitat utilization across life stages. Juvenile growth was positively correlated with bottom temperature, whereas growth of adults was negatively correlated with bottom temperature. Correlations for both were strongest during autumn (September to October). For juveniles, the temperature-growth relationship likely reflects a response to growing season length while for adults it could reflect temperature-dependent changes to metabolic rate or food availability. For both juveniles and adults, we also found inverse relationship between population density and growth.
