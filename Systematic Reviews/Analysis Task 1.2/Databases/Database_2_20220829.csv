Thus, the horizon scanning is becoming a major strand in proactive risk management and patient-consumer protection continuity. This approach was recently explained in the scientific opinion on risk assessment of parasites in fishery products by the European Food Safety Authority, EFSA (2010), followed by the launching of a funding scheme for a specific EU Framework Program Project under the Knowledge Based Bio-Economy concept, KBBE (FP7-KBBE-2012-6), which drives the new EU 2020 strategy. The aim of this paper is to examine horizon scanning issues in relation to public health and industrial concern on the presence of parasites in fishery products recorded in the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) System. We focus on specific threats, targets, methods and challenges as a means of acquiring management goals and future objectives. The proposed horizon scanning identifies emerging ideas/technologies for an early handling of parasitized fish stocks/products for priority setting to inform strategic planning of stakeholders, policy-makers and health services. In order to accomplish this, a set of risk GIS maps illustrating the state of art about the presence of the zoonotic Anisakis spp. on commercial fish stocks of the last 65 years was firstly developed. Secondly, a program of 108 surveys among fish sellers of Galicia (NW Spain) were carried out with the main objective of getting information about hazard recognition, fish product management practices, quality self-controls and corrective and preventive measures in use. Additionally, during the ""I International Symposium on strategies for management of parasitized seafood products"" (Vigo, Spain), groups of researchers, technologists, official inspectors and industries participated in round tables with 3 different perspectives: market-industry, inspection and academia. All scanners agreed that the status quo to manage fish parasites in the production-to-consumption food pathway is unsatisfactory. The central message proposed a stable network performance based on collaborative software to provide multi-level information for industrial management of parasite contaminants in fish products. The discussion group also proposed to invigorate collaborative translational research and professional training as key drivers to fuel technological innovations and tech transfer, which may help to minimize/eliminate the risk of parasites that have public health and economic impacts in fish products. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,,CS - Western Waters,">100,000",Unspecified,,,Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey,Spearman Rank,2,2,3,Western Waters,CS,RASFF - Food Safety ,"Conflict avoidance (Economic, Social, Environmental)",Health,Unspecified,Country level,Lit Review - Questionnaires - Surveys,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Food quality_Health (public),Unspecified,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The presence of multiple trade-offs complicates the identification of strategies that satisfy various policy requirements while being acceptable to affected stakeholder groups. This creates a demand for tools and processes that support learning, cooperation and planning. We report on the application of decision support methodology used in combination with a co-creation approach to scenario based planning for the demersal fisheries of the West coast of Scotland. These fisheries face significant challenges, such as the depletion of key stocks and increased predation by seals. In collaboration with stakeholders we identified generic management alternatives and indicators to evaluate their performance in a structured evaluation using Multi Criteria Analysis. We identify the potential and limitations of this approach and suggest how it can contribute to Ecosystem Based Fisheries Management (EBFM).

Combining a discard ban with catch quotas, where all fish, independent of size, count towards quotas could create economic incentives for more selective fishing, reducing unwanted catches. We use fishing activities data from English North Sea otter trawlers to examine the impact of these measures on this fleet. Initial impacts depend on the scale of increase and distribution of quotas and are unevenly distributed, depending on catch and discard characteristics of vessels. Selective fishing will be rewarded as vessels that currently have low discards could increase catches and profits. Fishing by less selective vessels will be curtailed, reducing profits by 1-14%. This could be partially mitigated through reducing regulated catches but will require changes to fishing patterns as using currently available selective fishing gears may impact on profitability. So, catch quotas and a discard ban create strong incentives for more selective fishing practices, but also for non-compliance with full documentation of catches. A high level of monitoring and enforcement will be required to ensure that fishers improve profitability through more selective fishing practices rather than illegal discarding. © 2014 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Lack of data or misreporting maybe reasons for unreliable stock assessment, which, in turn,mayresult in advice that does not reflect the availability of fisheries resources. It has been suggested that the mixed pelagic trawl fisheries in the Baltic represent a case of biased estimates of fish biomass and mortality resulting from misreporting. Here, we estimate the degree of misreporting in the Swedish pelagic fishery (1996-2009) and propose an approach for reconstructing historical catches based on commercial effort data. The analysis suggests that total catches have been underestimated during part of our study period and that systematic misreporting of species composition has taken place over the whole study period. The analysis also suggests that there is overcapacity in the fishery and that such economic incentive could explain the general patterns of misreporting. Applying our method for fisheries with suspected misreporting could significantly improve assessment accuracy, reduce uncertainty and thereby allow for a better link between catches and resource levels. © International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2014.

Purse-seine fishery, as one of the biggest marine fishery sub-sectors, has a pioneering socio-ecological influence within the marine fisheries sector of Turkey. In this study, we examined the technical efficiencies of the Turkish purse-seine vessels along the Aegean coasts of Turkey. To implement this analysis, we first collected a data set of technical and economic dimensions of active Turkish purse-seine vessels in the Aegean Sea. Then, we used two-stage Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approaches, including input-oriented bootstrapped DEA under constant and various returns-to-scale technologies. In the first stage, we calculated bootstrapped efficiencies across vessels by using technical factors of fisheries production and harvest value as input/output factors. At the second stage, we performed an in-depth analysis of the endogenous determinants of the efficiency scores by using the statistical models under various statistical specifications. We found that most of the purse seine vessels in fleet segment 1 (<24 m) got low-efficiency scores (<0.30) while efficiency scores of fleet segment 2 (?24 m) emerged to have scores that were homogeneously distributed between 0 and 1. Landing amounts and landing values of fleet segment 1 appeared to have superior efficient frontier levels compared with fleet segment 2 although fleet segment 2 had substantially positive relationships with the predicted efficiency scores. Higher engine power, as well as higher numbers of crew onboard, did not statistically explain neither desired efficiency scores nor expected landings and market values. Overall, various excess production inputs, including gross tonnage, engine power, total generator power, lamp boat generator power, were predicted to be in excess use. To conclude, fisheries managers should account for the operational performance of the fishing vessels to better design optimal fisheries policies in the future. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,,Scopus,,CS - Mediterranean,">100,000",year,">100,000",snapshot/no repeat sampling,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey,no inference,2,3,3,Mediterranean,CS,Unspecified,Fleet Efficiency ,Economic,Positive,Country level,Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA),Unspecified,Large-scale,Costs (operational)_Fishing Effort (days at sea)_Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)_Employment on board (crew)_Fishing capacity (Gross Tonnage),Unspecified,Seine,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

The new EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) constitutes an excellent opportunity to introduce the changes needed for such a reform. According to this CFP, all European fish stocks should be brought to a state where they can produce at MSY by 2020 at the latest. The CFP also establishes that the objective of sustainable exploitation should be achieved through multiannual plans (MAPs) adopted in consultation with relevant stakeholders having fisheries management interests such as fishermen, non-governmental organizations, and policy makers. Together with the MSY and MAP approaches, the new CFP contains several other measures, directed to guarantee the ecological and socio-economic sustainability of fisheries by means of the implementation of the ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM). With this new perspective, the CFP wants to avoid past failures of fisheries management based on monospecific approaches. This study is a first step toward the application of the EAFM in the Balearic Islands by means of the development of a harvest strategy with defined objectives, targets, limits, and clear management control rules aimed at optimizing socioeconomic and ecological objectives in the framework of the new CFP. Different management scenarios designed to achieve that goal were modeled for the main demersal commercial fisheries from the study area, the bottom trawl, and small-scale fisheries. The work begins with a general description of those fisheries, their main fishing grounds, and assessments of the exploitation status of the main target stocks in order to establish the current situation. Secondly, alternative management scenarios to maximize catch and profits while considering societal objectives were evaluated by means of bio-economic models.

The anchovy fishery in the Bay of Biscay, which was closed for 5 years, from 2005 to 2009, is one of the most important sources of revenue for the Basque pelagic purse-seiner fleet. Throughout the course of this closure the fleet was forced to find alternative revenue streams. In the present study, the fishing alternatives were analysed before and during the anchovy fishery closure, defining an adaptability indicator to measure the ability of the fleet to cope with fisheries closures. Four differently-behaved segments were found within the purse-seiner fleet. Only one of these segments managed to maintain the same level of turnover during the anchovy closure, while the others could not reach a minimum level of adaptability. Compensation of the fishery closure through financial aid was studied, analysing the impact that public aid had on the profit of each segment and on the adaptability indicator. © 2012 EDP Sciences, IFREMER, IRD.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,,CS - Western Waters,">100,000",five year,">100,000",month,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey,no,2,2,3,Western Waters,CS,Unspecified,Fleet Efficiency ,Economic,Positive,Individual,Regression analysis,Unspecified,Large-scale,Landings (volume)_Landings (value)_Fishing capacity (Gross Tonnage)_Number of vessels ,Unspecified,Seine,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

In quota-regulated fisheries, intra- and inter-temporal substitutions of fishing effort is regarded as a key mechanisms that influences the profitability of the fishing portfolio. The feeding and spawning migration patterns of the available fish species in the fishing portfolio alter the bio-economic conditions of the different fishing areas. In addition, the spatial heterogeneity among different fishing areas in terms of the fuel costs and travel distance, accessibility to other fishing fleets, and sea ice extent affects the relative attractiveness of the fishing areas and further complicates the decisions underlying the effort allocation, such as when and where to fish what and how much to fish to maximize the profit. In this regard, the aim of this article is to identify the key drivers of intra- and inter-temporal effort allocation in a multi-species trawl fishery consisting of 61 Norwegian trawl vessels targeting cod, saithe, and haddock, the aim being to maximize the fishing profit within the quota constraints. We adopted a two-step Heckman estimator that incorporates the relative attractiveness of three heavily trawled areas, the southern and northern parts of the west coast of Norway and the high sea areas of the Arctic. The relative attractiveness is specified by the fish availability, measured using the catch per unit of effort, prices of the target species, fuel cost, intensity of the coastal fleet's participation in winter fishery, and seasonal sea ice extent in the Barents Sea during the period 2011-2016. Our results show that region-specific attributes and spatial margins have a profound impact on the intra-temporal and inter-temporal allocation of fishing effort to maximize the seasonal profit. Furthermore, we found evidence of economically rational behaviour of the Norwegian trawlers in constantly reallocating their fishing effort in response to the changes in the relative attractiveness of the selected fishing areas over the course of a fishing year. © 2021 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2021.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,,North Sea - non CS,">100,000",five year,"1,000-5,000",month,Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey,Two-step Heckman Estimator,3,2,2,North Sea,non-CS,Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ),Fleet Efficiency ,Economic,Unspecified,Region level,Indicators analysis,Catch per unit of effort (CPUE)_Intensity of the coastal fleet's participation in winter fishery,Unspecified,Fish price_Fuel costs_Seasonal sea ice extent,Unspecified,Trawl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Among the main fleets, bottom trawlers target Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) and, together with gillnetters, they also catch hake (Merluccius merluccius). Trawling leads to average-size catches that are below the minimum landing size (MLS); such catches are discarded since they cannot be sold. These discards result in negative impacts on stock renewal, as most of them do not survive. This also results in an economic loss for both bottom trawlers and gillnetters since these discards represent a future loss of rent. This study, based on the 2009 and 2010 selectivity experiments at sea, assesses the short-and long-term bio-economic impacts of four experimental selective devices aimed at reducing N. norvegicus and M. merluccius discards over a 20-year simulation period. Tests were conducted at sea on a research trawler. Using the impact assessment model for fisheries management (IAM model), selectivity scenarios for trawlers in the Bay of Biscay were compared to a theoretical selective scenario of adopting an optimal device that catches only N. norvegicus and M. merluccius above MLS (9 cm and 27 cm total length, respectively). Costs and benefits were analyzed with the objective of finding the best compromise between a reduction in discards of undersized fish and a loss of valuable catches among the experimental devices. Selectivity scenarios show positive impacts on stocks but different economic impacts between fleets. The combination of a square mesh cylinder with a grid and square mesh panels gives the closest results to the theoretical scenario tested in terms of stock recovery and economic benefits. This experimental device leads to low economic losses in the short term and eventually to higher N. norvegicus yields, which would be favourable for fleets that greatly contribute to N. norvegicus fishing efforts. © 2012 EDP Sciences, IFREMER, IRD.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,,CS - Western Waters,"50,000-100,000",year,"500-1,000",year,Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey,,2,2,2,Western Waters,CS,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Country level,"Bioeconomic modelling (BEMCOM, BEMTOOL, FLBEIA, MEFISTO, FISHRENT, Impact Assessment Models (IAMS), SMART, EFIMAS)",Unspecified,Unspecified,Landing costs_Fuel costs_Costs (variable)_Costs (repair & maintenance)_Costs (other)_Labor cost_Costs (operational),Fishing mortality,Trawl _ Gillnets,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

We assessed the risk of adverse effects from abrasion caused by bottom fishing, as a case study, to demonstrate an integrated spatial management methodology. Risk was quantified in the Galway Bay, Ireland region using a 1 km grid, as the ratio between mortality and recovery of benthic infauna exposed to abrasion effects estimated from fishing data. Risk was considered high if annual mortality exceeded recovery. A Bayesian network model, incorporating ecological and economic data, compared three management scenarios: i) business as usual (BAU), ii) exclusion of fishing vessels over 18 m within 6 nautical miles (68% of study area) (Length) and iii) a network of marine protected areas (MPAs) closed to all fishing vessels (11% of study area) (MPA). The BAU scenario indicated that risk was high for 85.6% of the study area. The length scenario resulted in a 14.6% reduction in high risk cells, affecting 0.9 M of landings, 0.7 M of indirect output and 19 full time equivalent (FTE) employees. The MPA scenario resulted in a 1.7% reduction of high risk cells. This scenario affected 0.17M in landings, 0.13M in indirect outputs and 3 FTE employees. We present a method which provides a quantitative, spatial, risk and economic impact assessment of the effects of human activities and pressures on the marine environment that assesses potential costs and benefits of management options to mitigate against these pressures.

A fleet of about 73,000 vessels is widespread along the Mediterranean coasts. Artisanal activities are predominant in South Mediterranean and in the eastern basin, while trawling features GSAs in the western basin and the Adriatic Sea. The overall landings of fish, crustaceans and cephalopods, after peaking during mid 90s at about one million tons, declined at about 700,000 tons in 2013. However, while landings are declining in EU countries since the 90s, in non-EU countries a decreasing trend was observed only in the last 510 years. The current levels of fishing effort determine a general overexploitation status of commercial stocks with more than 90% of the stock assessed out of safe biological limits. Indicators obtained from available ecosystem models were used to assess the sustainability of the fisheries. They included primary production required to sustain fisheries (PPR), mean trophic level of the catch (mTLc), the loss in secondary production index (L index), and the probability of the ecosystem to be sustainably exploited (psust ). In areas exploited more sustainably (e.g., Gulf of Gabes, Eastern Ionian, and Aegean Sea) fishing pressure was characterized by either low number of vessels per unit of shelf area or the large prevalence of artisanal/small scale fisheries. Conversely, GSAs in Western Mediterranean and Adriatic showed very low ecosystem sustainability of fisheries that can be easily related with the high fishing pressure and the large proportion of overfished stocks obtained from single species assessments. We showed that the current knowledge on Mediterranean fisheries and ecosystems describes a worrisome picture where the effect of poorly regulated fisheries, in combination with the ongoing climate forcing and the rapid expansion of non-indigenous species, are rapidly changing the structure and functioning of the ecosystem with unpredictable effects on the goods and services provided. Although this would call for urgent conservation actions, the management system implemented in the region appears too slow and probably inadequate to protect biodiversity and secure fisheries resources for the future generations. © 2017 Colloca, Scarcella and Libralato.",English,Review,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,,CS - Mediterranean,">100,000",multidecadal,"10,000-50,000",year,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey,Linear Regression,3,3,2,Mediterranean,CS,Unspecified,"Conflict avoidance (Economic, Social, Environmental)",Economic_Environmental,Negative,Region level,Indicators analysis,[Economic:]Continental Shelf Area vs Total Annual Landings_N. vessels/Km2_N. trawlers/Km2_[Environmental:] TB: Total ecosystem biomass (t/km2)_TC: Total Ecosystem Catches including discards (t/km2/year)_PPR%: ratio primary production required to sustain fisheries to PP_mTLc: mean trophic level of the catch_GE: Gross efficiency (landings/PP)_L index: Loss in secondary production index_Psust: Probability to be sustainably fished,Artisanal/Commercial,Number of vessels _Landings (volume)_Continental shelf surface,Unspecified,Various,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The effect will be assessed in terms of reduction of fishing capacity in the Dutch beam trawl fleet and its economic and social impact. These Dutch experiences will be translated to the current debate on the reform of the EU Common Fisheries Policy.

Catchability was adjusted by accounting for targeting by this gear, seasonal and area effects, and individual vessel variation, using results from a generalised linear mixed-effects model (GLMM) that included random effects (in this case, vessel). Descriptors were standardised in relation to distinct submétiers and their impact on both species. Fishing efficiency was calculated as the ratio between relative nominal landings per unit effort derived from the GLMM and survey indices from a standard survey vessel.

In addition, a spatial multi-criteria approach were used to investigate discard hot-spot areas using ecological criteria such as vulnerability and resilience of the discarded species. Using these ecological criteria will concentrate conservation efforts on the most relevant sites minimizing discards of a variety of potentially vulnerable species. This approach was applied to a case study of a multi-species demersal bottom trawl fisheries in north Spain, Cantabrian Sea (ICES area VIIIc). Results showed how spatial and economic factors highly affect species discard composition, identifying specific spatial-temporal discard hot-spots to be preferentially avoided by fishers. Mitigation measures for future fisheries management strategies should be implemented at multiple stages of the discarding process, both in the selection of the fishing grounds and the economic valorization of the discarded species. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,,Scopus,,Western Waters - non CS,">100,000",five year,"500-1,000",quarter,Fisheries Dependent Data,"""Receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC)""_""True Skill Statistic (TSS)""",3,3,3,Western Waters,non-CS,Discard ban Policy,Species protection-Discard reduction,Economic_Environmental,Positive,Unspecified,Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis,Unspecified,Unspecified,Fish price_Landings (value)_Sea Surface Temperature (SST)_Sea Surface Salinity (SSS),Unspecified,Unspecified,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The stocks of interest were hake, black-bellied angler, deep-water rose shrimp, red mullet, blue and red shrimp, Norway lobster and blue whiting, all of which were assessed as overexploited. Their combined production corresponds to 34% by volume and 52% by value of the landings of the demersal fishery studied. Simulation scenarios based on effort reduction, changes in the selectivity pattern and implementing a fisheries restricted area were compared over the simulation horizon of 20152030. The latter two scenarios were also examined in terms of full or partial compliance. The effect of a discard ban on the economy of the fleet was also analysed. The results show that the fishery is not co-viable because some stocks are not viable in the projection period, but social and economic viability was ensured in all cases. As is often the case for mixed fisheries, a unique management measure is unlikely to improve the situation of all stocks simultaneously, but all the management measures tested are better than the status quo. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",English,Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,,Mediterranean - non CS,">100,000",five year,"500-1,000",year,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey,Scenarios Analysis,1,1,3,Mediterranean,non-CS,Discard ban Policy,Species protection-Discard reduction,Economic_Social_Environmental,Unspecified,Region level,spawning stock biomass / recruitment (SSB/R) Beverton and Holt model,Unspecified,Small-scale,"Spawning stock biomass (SSB)_Initial Abundance_Mean individual weight_Labor cost_Profit (net)_Fishing Effort (days at sea)_Quota allocation_Costs (variable)_Cost per unit of fishing effort (CPUE)_Capital value of unit effort (CapPUE)

Also, variability is expected to decrease with portfolio width. Using a range of indicators, these predictions were tested for the French fishing fleets in the Bay of Biscay (Northeast Atlantic) during the period 2001-2009. For this, vessels were grouped into eight fishing fleets based on the gears used and exploited species were grouped into five functional groups. The portfolio width of fleets ranged from 1-3 functional groups, or 4-19 species. Economic fleet returns (sale revenues minus fishing costs) varied strongly between years; the interannual variability was independent of portfolio width (species or functional groups). Energy ratio expressed by the ratio between fuel energy used for fishing and energy contained in landings varied from 0.3 for purse seines to 9.7 for trawlers using bottom trawls alone or in combination with pelagic trawls independent of portfolio width. Interannual variability in total sale revenues was larger than the sum of species specific sales revenue variability, except for fleets using hooks and pelagic trawlers; it increased with the number of species exploited.

Therefore, mixed fisheries present a harder challenge for fisheries management than single-species fisheries and the uncertainty can start at the definition of the target species. In these particular fisheries, we have a large group of species that are caught, being target or not, species with large landing values that are actually not target, and species with a high economic value that can fall in the bycatch category. Although the dynamics of such fisheries is poorly understood, they are known to have a relevant contribution to Portuguese fishers' revenue. The present demand on sustainable fishing activities to ensure marine ecosystem preservation has led towards an ecosystem approach where effort is being made to take into account biological and technical interactions on management measures and advice. In this work, logbooks data of the Portuguese multi-gear fleet were used to identify different fisheries based on catch composition and gears through cluster analysis (CLARA). Two identified fisheries were used to explore the impact of these fishing activities on the ecosystem scale. This approach was achieved by a productivity and susceptibility analysis and through foodweb analysis. The relation between species vulnerability and their functional role in the ecosystem were highlighted. Technical interactions among fishing gears, and species biological interactions, were explored within and among fisheries.Wefound and illustrated that these interactions go beyond the fleets and fisheries considered in the present work. This approach allows us to identify key elements that can, ultimately, be relevant to an ecosystem-based approach towards mixed fisheries management. © 2015 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

The separate management of these aspectsmay lead to conflicting objectives. Coviability analysis helps us to rank a set of choices (alternative management measures) objectively, allows us to explore which policies will ensure strong sustainability, and formally recognizes the multi-objective nature of fisheries management. The coviability of the main Western Mediterranean Spanish fisheries was examined with a bioeconomic simulation model under alternative management strategies that implement strong fishing mortality reduction policies. Based on a joint (biological and economic) viability assessment, it has been shown that Western Mediterranean fisheries require the reduction of fishing effort to ? 10% of the 2010 levels. This strong conservation measure would need to be applied as soon as possible in order for European Mediterranean fisheries to be managed at MSY, as required by legally binding international agreements, which may be unrealistic. Large reductions in fishing mortality for stocks that have been subject to high exploitation rates for decades are difficult to achieve with the current paradigm of effort control in the Mediterranean. Instead, reorienting the exploitation of Mediterranean fish stocks with management measures that combine changes in exploitation patterns with seasonal or spatial area closures, should help meet the policy goals of fishing mortality levels compatible with MSY by 2020. © International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2014.

Despite the growing concerns about the spatial dimension of fisheries, the distribution of resources and fishing effort in space is seldom considered in assessment and management processes. Here we propose SMART (Spatial MAnagement of demersal Resources for Trawl fisheries), a tool for assessing bio-economic feedback in different management scenarios. SMART combines information from different tasks gathered within the European Data Collection Framework on fisheries and is composed of: 1) spatial models of fishing effort, environmental characteristics and distribution of demersal resources; 2) an Artificial Neural Network which captures the relationships among these aspects in a spatially explicit way and uses them to predict resources abundances; 3) a deterministic module which analyzes the size structure of catches and the associated revenues, according to different spatially-based management scenarios. SMART is applied to demersal fishery in the Strait of Sicily, one of the most productive fisheries of the Mediterranean Sea. Three of the main target species are used as proxies for the whole range exploited by trawlers. After training, SMART is used to evaluate different management scenarios, including spatial closures, using a simulation approach that mimics the recent exploitation patterns. Results evidence good model performance, with a noteworthy coherence and reliability of outputs for the different components. Among others, the main finding is that a partial improvement in resource conditions can be achieved by means of nursery closures, even if the overall fishing effort in the area remains stable. Accordingly, a series of strategically designed areas of trawling closures could significantly improve the resource conditions of demersal fisheries in the Strait of Sicily, also supporting sustainable economic returns for fishermen if not applied simultaneously for different species. © 2014 Russo et al.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,,CS - Mediterranean,">100,000",five year,"500-1,000",year,Fisheries Dependent Data,Spatially Explicit Bio-Economic Model,2,2,3,Mediterranean,CS,Effort Control,Species protection-Discard reduction,Economic_Social_Environmental_Governance,Positive,Country level,"Bioeconomic modelling (BEMCOM, BEMTOOL, FLBEIA, MEFISTO, FISHRENT, Impact Assessment Models (IAMS), SMART, EFIMAS)",Unspecified,Unspecified,Fishing Effort (days at sea)_Fuel costs,Economic Performance_Sustainability-Resilience,Trawl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Therefore, management actions to achieve a more sustainable exploitation of fishery resources are required and compelling. In this study, a spatially explicit multi-species bio-economic modeling approach, namely, SMART, was applied to the case study of central Mediterranean Sea to assess the potential effects of different trawl fisheries management scenarios on the demersal resources. The approach combines multiple modeling components, integrating the best available sets of spatial data about catches and stocks, fishing footprint from vessel monitoring systems (VMS) and economic parameters in order to describe the relationships between fishing effort pattern and impacts on resources and socio-economic consequences. Moreover, SMART takes into account the bi-directional connectivity between spawning and nurseries areas of target species, embedding the outcomes of a larvae transport Lagrangian model and of an empirical model of fish migration. Finally, population dynamics and trophic relationships are considered using a MICE (Models of Intermediate Complexity) approach. SMART simulates the fishing effort reallocation resulting from the introduction of different management scenarios. Specifically, SMART was applied to evaluate the potential benefits of different management approaches of the trawl fisheries targeting demersal stocks (deepwater rose shrimp Parapenaeus longirostris, the giant red shrimp Aristaeomorpha foliacea, the European hake Merluccius merluccius, and the red mullet Mullus barbatus) in the Strait of Sicily. The simulated management scenarios included a reduction of both fishing capacity and effort, two different sets of temporal fishing closures, and two sets of spatial fishing closures, defined involving fishers. Results showed that both temporal and spatial closures are expected to determine a significant improvement in the exploitation pattern for all the species, ultimately leading to the substantial recovery of spawning stock biomass for the stocks. Overall, one of the management scenarios suggested by fishers scored better and confirms the usefulness of participatory approaches, suggesting the need for more public consultation when dealing with resource management at sea. © Copyright © 2019 Russo, D'Andrea, Franceschini, Accadia, Cucco, Garofalo, Gristina, Parisi, Quattrocchi, Sabatella, Sinerchia, Canu, Cataudella and Fiorentino.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,,CS - Mediterranean,">100,000",five year,"1,000-5,000",year,Fisheries Dependent Data,spatially explicit multi-species bio-economic modeling approach (SMART),2,2,3,Mediterranean,CS,Effort Control,Stock recovery,Economic_Environmental,Negative,Country level,"Bioeconomic modelling (BEMCOM, BEMTOOL, FLBEIA, MEFISTO, FISHRENT, Impact Assessment Models (IAMS), SMART, EFIMAS)",Unspecified,Unspecified,Costs (operational)_Profit (gross)_Number of vessels _Fishing Effort (days at sea),Economic Performance_Profitability,Trawl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

This paper leverages a bioeconomic model based on a specific case study of the Western Mediterranean Sea to analyze the objectives of this new EU reform. We complement this analysis with simulations based on alternative management strategies: the reduction of fishing effort of 12 days-per-week and changes to selectivity patterns. Effects on artisanal fleets are also analyzed in order to assess scenarios that could achieve sustainability for all demersal fishing fleets. The results reveal that it is not possible to achieve the plans aims for all stocks. Furthermore, the fishing time established is insufficient, although it would increase economic, and biological indicators for medium- and long-term periods. The best scenarios would be achieved by applying selective changes that provide for faster recovery of biological and economic indicators for trawler and artisanal fleets. The results also reveal that the reduction in the number of fishing days per week complemented with selectivity changes would have a lower socioeconomic impact than a reduction in fishing effort based entirely on fishing days or number of boats. In any case, Mediterranean demersal fisheries require a significant and well-planned reduction in fishing mortality levels over the next several years to recover and maintain sustainable exploitation. © Copyright © 2020 Sola, Maynou and Sánchez-Lizaso.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,,CS - Mediterranean,">100,000",multidecadal,"5,000-10,000",multidecadal,Fisheries Dependent Data,Bioeconomic model based on MEFISTO,2,2,3,Mediterranean,CS,Effort Control,Stock recovery,Economic_Environmental,Positive,Region level,"Bioeconomic modelling (BEMCOM, BEMTOOL, FLBEIA, MEFISTO, FISHRENT, Impact Assessment Models (IAMS), SMART, EFIMAS)",Unspecified,Unspecified,Fishing Effort (days at sea)_Number of vessels _Costs (operational)_Costs (variable)_Costs (others),Economic Performance_Stock Protection,Trawl_Gillnets_Trammel nets_Longlines,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

We model ecosystem effects of fishing in the North Sea using food web model projections incorporating fishing effort strategies consistent with MSY targets.

Climate warming may also decrease biomasses of bentho-piscivores and piscivores, while planktivores, benthivores and state indicators of size and trophic level may increase.

Mainly smaller coastal vessels deploying Danish seines and gillnets reduced in numbers. The ecosystem effects of this structural change were investigated by comparing the sustainability of a local, small-scale, coastal fishery (Thorupstrand) using Danish seines and gillnets with that of demersal trawling by larger vessels using the same fishing grounds. The fisheries were compared using six ecological and socio-economic indicators: 1), discards (food web), 2), by-catch incidences (food web/biodiversity), 3), seabed impacts, 4), fuel use efficiency, 5), quality of fish landed (food provision), and 6), social and cultural gains and drawbacks (social and cultural features). Except for by-catch of vulnerable species, the fisheries using Danish seines and gillnets scored better in all indicators when compared to otter trawls. Additional commercial and cultural benefits of establishing a local fishery guild with share-owned quotas and land-based facilities were investigated.

Thorough research is required in order to understand fishers perceptions and to achieve effective implementation of the regulation, as it is possible that certain implications might arise within the fishing industry and the associated communities after the shift to the new management regime. In this paper, fishers socio-economic behaviour is analyzed in relation to discarding practices under the discrete choice framework. Specifically, a variety of socioeconomic attributes, in the form of principal components that may affect the choices of the Greek bottom trawl fishers on three key discards drivers are analyzed to identify possible links between these. Utilizing the same attributes, eight hypothetical management tools that can be adopted for a smoother implementation of the discard ban are examined and the main results are discussed afterwards. Consistent patterns were revealed regarding fishers behaviour. An association of vessels efficiency with the probability to discard due to market limitations was evident, along with the association of different socioeconomic factors, such as the fishers age and the vessel's crew size, with the incentives proposed regarding the introduction of awareness seminars. It is important to study these patterns carefully to understand the drivers and fishers motivation towards discarding. Their preferences on management tools that can be adopted by the EU member will also be considered, which can lead to a successful introduction of the regulation and a meaningful contribution into an effective management framework within which stakeholders can behave sustainably. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,,Scopus,,CS - Mediterranean,"50,000-100,000",year,"500-1,000",year,Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey,Principal Component Analysis,2,2,3,Mediterranean,CS,Discard ban Policy,Species protection-Discard reduction,Social,Unspecified,Country level,Principal Component Analysis (PCA),Unspecified,Small-scale,Gross tonnage_Landings (volume)_Length of the fleet_Fuel costs_Employment on board (crew)_Fishers age_Discards_Costs (fixed)_Engine power_Estimated vessel value,Year of vessel construction,Trawl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

The paper shows that, as in much of the North Atlantic small-scale fisheries, the volume of discards of these species is relatively small, at 05% of the total volume of catches. However, while the volume of discards may increase as quotas allocated to a fleet are exhausted, discards by the small-scale fleet are managed by a combination of effort and minimum size. The main reason given by fishers is that small-scale fishing is highly selective and has a discard ratio significantly lower than that of industrial fishing. Regarding the impacts of the landing obligation (LO), this paper shows that 88% of the Galician small-scale fishers interviewed who harvest species (Atlantic mackerel, European hake and ray) under the European Union TAC regulation. Indeed, 60% of the fishers indicated that the implementation of the LO would mean they would leave small-scale fishing. The main incentive to avoiding discards lies in changing the system of TACs and quotas (based on the principle of relative stability of the EU), promoting small-scale fishing and increasing de de minimis exceptions. The fact that many small-scale fishers are not willing to accept the LO highlights the lack of information and dialogue on the part of authorities regarding the impact of the LO on small-scale fishing. Regarding the economic and social impact of the LO on Galician small-scale fisheries, the economic loss for the fleet which harvest species under the TAC regulation is estimated to be 58,753,632 EUR per year. In macroeconomic terms, the direct economic loss will lead to lost income taxes plus the cost of unemployment payments to affected fishers. In microeconomic terms, given the high dependence on fishing revenues of coastal communities, the household incomes of around 3000 small-scale fishers (nearly 11,000 people taking into account family members) would be negatively affected. The effects on other economic branches supplying goods and services to small-scale fisheries are excluded from this estimate. This impact would further aggravate the social and economic crisis of the Galician small-scale fishing sector, which has lost 17% of its fishing vessels and 20% direct employment in the last decade. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,,Scopus,,CS - Western Waters,">100,000",decade,"1,000-5,000",year,Fisheries Dependent Data,Time series analysis,2,2,2,Western Waters,CS,Landing obligation,Species protection-Discard reduction,Social,Negative,Country level,Lit Review - Questionnaires - Surveys,Unspecified,Small-scale,Landings (volume)_Landings (value)_Employment on board (crew)_Fishing capacity (Gross Tonnage)_Length of the fleet,Unspecified,Gillnets_Handlines_Longlines_Netters_Trammel nets_Traps,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

Here, we develop, and apply to North Sea fisheries, a method for collectively assessing the effects of, and interplay between, technical interactions, multispecies interactions, and the environmental effects of fishing. Ecological interactions involving 21 species are characterized with an ensemble of 188 plausible parameterizations of size-based multispecies models, and four fleets (beam trawl, otter trawl, industrial, and pelagic) characterized with catch composition data. We use the method to evaluate biomass and economic yields, alongside the risk of stock depletion and changes in the value of community indicators, for 10 000 alternate fishing scenarios (combinations of rates of fishing mortality F and fleet configuration) and present the risk vs. reward trade-offs. Technical and multispecies interactions linked to the beam and otter trawl fleets were predicted to have the strongest effects on fisheries yield and value, risk of stock collapse and fish community indicators. Increasing beam trawl effort led to greater increases in beam trawl yield when otter trawl effort was low. If otter trawl effort was high, increases in beam trawl effort led to reduced overall yield. Given the high value of demersal species, permutations of fleet effort leading to high total yield (generated primarily by pelagic species) were not the same as permutations leading to high catch values. A transition from F for 1990 to 2010 to FMSY, but without changes in fleet configuration, reduced risk of stock collapse without affecting long-term weight or value of yield. Our approach directly addresses the need for assessment methods that treat mixed and multispecies issues collectively, address uncertainty, and take account of trade-offs between weight and value of yield, state of stocks and state of the environment. © 2016 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2016.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,,CS - North Sea,">100,000",decade,">100,000",year,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey,simulation_parametrization,2,2,3,North Sea,CS,Catch limit,Species protection-Discard reduction,Social,Positive,Region level,Simulations_multispecies size-structured fish community models,Unspecified,Large-scale,Fishing Effort (days at sea)_Turnover,Unspecified,Trawl_Industrial_Various_Pelagic,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1

Since discarding may reduce economic benefits and bias stock assessments, mechanisms that reduce incentives to discard can be beneficial. However, these mechanisms may be detrimental in the long term if they also pose a risk of stock depletion, which can occur if they enable catch to persistently exceed the total allowable catch (TAC). This study uses a bioeconomic model to analyse potential negative consequences of species quota transformation provisions, using the Icelandic individual transferable quota system as a case study. These provisions allow quota of one species to be transformed into quota of another species at specified rates related to relative market value. The system reduces the degree that the TAC of any particular species constrains catch of other species. However, it also allows catches of some species to exceed TACs, possibly leading to stock depletion. We explore how these provisions may affect long-term sustainability of individual species and profitability of the fishery as a whole. We focus on the extreme case of perfect targeting (i.e. full control of catch composition) to increase intuition on the potential for adverse effects of this system. Various combinations of species profitability are examined to determine attributes of species that lead to greater vulnerability, as well as interactions in species utilization. Consequences of changing harvest control rules are explored, and information needed to monitor for unintended consequences of such a system in practice are discussed. Although the species transformation system is designed to increase economic efficiency, our results show that it could lead to depletion in some cases, and may make it difficult to achieve optimal management goals. © 2015 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2015.

A dynamic multi-species, multi-class, multi-fleet model is developed and calibrated using available biological, economic and environmental information for French fleets. Fishing and economic data have been collected within the European Data Collection Framework. Climate represented by the sea surface temperature is assumed to affect species recruitment. Three management strategies are compared in terms of bio-economic outcomes: the Status-Quo (SQ), a Multi-species Maximum Sustainable Yield (MMSY) strategy and a Multi-species Maximum Economic Yield (MMEY) strategy. These strategies are ranked with respect to two contrasted scenarios regarding the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) driving climate change. Results show that the SQ strategy is not sustainable and is characterized by a major decline of the key commercial species. By contrast, the MMSY strategy improves the ecological state and economic performance of the fishery. The MMEY strategy yields even greater bio-economic improvements. Bio-economic benefits are however altered by the effects of climate change. Under the MMEY strategy, fleets with more diversified catch structures perform better facing climate change. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,,Scopus,,CS - Western Waters,">100,000",decade,">100,000",year,Fisheries Dependent Data,no,2,2,3,Western Waters,CS,Fleet efficiency policies,Fleet Efficiency ,Social,Positive,Individual,"Bioeconomic modelling (BEMCOM, BEMTOOL, FLBEIA, MEFISTO, FISHRENT, Impact Assessment Models (IAMS), SMART, EFIMAS)",Unspecified,Various,Profit (gross)_Landings (value)_Fishing Effort (days at sea),Environmental factors_Biological factors,Gillnets_Trawl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

This article investigates fishermen's behavior in a situation in which a primary output quota is decreasing due to policy restrictions, The findings suggest that vessels respond to such situations by increasing pressure on unregulated species, using their spare capacity. This article models fishermen's behavior using a restricted profit function, treating the harvest of regulated species as fixed, while unregulated species are variable outputs. An empirical application is provided for the Polish trawler fleet with permits to harvest IVQ-regulated Atlantic Cod in the Baltic Sea. The results indicate a strong substitute relationship between the cod quota and pelagic species. Derived elasticities of intensity, providing a measure of the impact of a fixedfactor on variable factors, offer strong evidence of increasing pressure on pelagic species caused by decreasing quotas. © 2014 MRE Foundation, Inc.

Environmental and stock size changes caused a stock expansion after 2007, initiating a yet unresolved dispute between the European Union, United Kingdom, Iceland, Greenland and the Faroe Islands. We analyze the impacts of different Total Allowable Catches (TACs) on the mackerel stock and possible adaptations in simulated fleet behavior by applying an age-structured bio-economic optimization and simulation model, FishRent. We implement dynamic seasonal migration patterns, which alter the spatial extension of mackerel depending on biomass levels, assuming density dependent mechanisms. If true, this is an important consideration because it may provide the possibility for major fishing parties (the European Union, Norway and the UK) to exclude minor parties (Iceland) from fishing mackerel by selecting a high enough fishing pressure and therefore keeping the stock from migrating further north. This can, for instance, be achieved by setting a corresponding TAC. When applying a TAC under a business-as-usual scenario or higher, the stock biomass decreased close to BMSY on the long-term. In this case, the Danish fleets would benefit, increasing their profit up to 80%. All other fleets were negatively affected with a profit decreasing between 50% and 100% depending on the scenario. When applying a TAC according to the stock advice, the stock biomass was estimated to increase on the long-term. This benefitted the Irish and British fleets, but effects on the Icelandic fleet were neutral. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,,Scopus,,NE-Atlantic,">100,000",multidecadal,">100,000",quarter,Fisheries Dependent Data,scenarios comparison,3,3,3,NE-Atlantic,non-CS,Total Allowable Catch (TAC),Fleet Efficiency ,Social,Positive,Country level,"Bioeconomic modelling (BEMCOM, BEMTOOL, FLBEIA, MEFISTO, FISHRENT, Impact Assessment Models (IAMS), SMART, EFIMAS)",Unspecified,Large-scale,Costs (fixed) _ Costs (operational) _ Costs (others) _ Costs (variable) _ Fishing Effort (days at sea) _ Fuel costs _ Landings (value) _ Landings (volume)_Number of vessels _ Taxation _ Labor cost,Nationality,Trawl _ Seine,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

The revenue from the fishing exhibits substantial intra-annual variation and carries a significant degree of risk due to the presence of intrinsic volatilities in the marine environment, such as seasonal fluctuations in stock size and constant changes in market conditions over the course of a year. In the face of volatile revenue, fishers may allocate fishing effort and use a quota portfolio to minimize revenue risk. However, decisions underlying effort allocation, such as when to fish what and how much to harvest to match the catch size and remaining quota, are challenging. In this regard, a decision-making framework based on a bio-economic model is used to explore the revenue risk minimization behavior of the Norwegian codfish trawl fleet targeting three different species (cod, saithe, and haddock), given the constraints set by the quotas. The study comprises trawl catches and fishing effort as well as the prices for the frozen products of codfish to investigate the adopted harvest strategy under two different scenarios. The results indicate that a risk-minimizing strategy leads to inefficient allocation of fishing quotas and fishing effort and that potential economic losses from minimizing revenue risk outweigh the benefits. Moreover, our findings prove that enhancing revenue is more important than minimizing revenue risk for the trawlers. We argue that the spatial and temporal freedom of the trawl vessels, together with a vertically integrated trawl industry, may explain the prioritization of revenue enhancement over revenue risk minimization. The seasonal spawning aggregation of NEA cod and how this affects market prices shape the trawlers harvest strategy of increasing fishing revenue. © 2021 The Author(s)",English,Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,,Barents Sea,">100,000",five year,">100,000",two week,Fisheries Dependent Data,scenarios comparison,1,1,3,Barents Sea,non-CS,Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ),"Conflict avoidance (Economic, Social, Environmental)",Social,Negative,Individual,Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis,Unspecified,Large-scale,Revenues (total) _ Revenues per unit of effort (RPUE)_ Fish price _ Costs (total) _ Fishing Effort (days at sea),Adaptive Capacity,Trawl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Moreover, little insight exists on the impacts of past environmental and management changes on the German Baltic SSF. Using a spatial database developed specifically for the German Baltic SSF sector, we assess the sector's key structural and operational characteristics (vessel numbers, gears, landings and target species) to review its development during the period between 2000-09. We link exhibited trends with changes that took place in the wider Baltic Sea region in fisheries' resource abundance and management, in order to provide insights in the sector's adaptation potential to past changes. Results suggest that the SSF was affected by changes in the abundance and allocation of fishing opportunities (TACs) of major target species (herring and cod) and technical measures for fishing gear. There is also evidence to suggest that the SSF was affected by measures directed to the activity of the Large-Scale Fishery (LSF). We argue that such an approach can provide new insights on the impacts of future management changes or incidents of environmental variability on the SSF sector and is crucial in order to effectively integrate SSFs within policy. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",English,Article,,Scopus,,CS - Baltic Sea,">100,000",five year,"5,000-10,000",year,Fisheries Dependent Data,trend analysis,3,2,1,Baltic Sea,CS,Total Allowable Catch (TAC),Stock recovery,Social,Negative,Individual,Unspecified,Unspecified,Small-scale,Number of vessels _Landings (value)_Landings (volume),Unspecified,Gillnets,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We aimed to determine effects of closure in biologic and economic terms, using 10-year landing data from two representative trawling ports of the Western Mediterranean: Dénia and La Vila Joiosa. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to detect significant differences, before and after the closure, in standardized catch per unit effort (CPUE) at different seasons and sale prices at home/closed and neighbour/open ports. ANOVAs showed significantly higher CPUE after the closure for total landings and Mullus spp. of the Red mullet métier, Merluccius merluccius CPUE (in two years) and the total landings of the Norway lobster métier. On the contrary, significant lower values were observed after the closure for total CPUE (in early summer) and Aristeus antennatus of Red shrimp métier. Similar CPUE was observed at all levels when the closure took place in late summer. In economic terms, market prices of target species have decreased or shown no changes after the closure at home/closed and neighbouring/open ports. The only exception was the significant increase of the price for A. antennatus in Dénia during the closure in La Vila Joiosa. Depending on its timing, the closure would highlight some positive biological effects on some target species. However, closure leads to an unavoidable reduction in most of target species prices. An alternative management measure that is based on effort reduction in input-controlled multi-specific fisheries could ban one day per week when market prices of target species are lower. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,,Mediterranean - non CS,"10,000-50,000",decade,"10,000-50,000",day,Fisheries Dependent Data,ANOVA,1,2,2,Mediterranean,non-CS,Seasonal closure,Social equity,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Individual,ANOVA / PERMANOVA,Unspecified,Large-scale,Landings (volume) _ Landings (value) _ Fish price _ Fishing Effort (days at sea) _ Cost per unit of fishing effort (CPUE),Unspecified,Trawl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

If these goals are to be fulfilled under changing environmental conditions, a readjustment of the current management plan may be needed. Therefore, this paper investigates the economic impacts of managing the cod, sprat and herring stocks in the eastern Baltic Sea, given on-going climate change, which is known to affect cod recruitment negatively. It is shown that climate change may have severe biological and economic consequences under the current cod management plan and that the negative effects on the economic performance of the fishermen as well as on the abundance of cod can be mitigated by reducing the target fishing mortality rate of cod. These results are obtained by simulating three management scenarios in which the economic consequences of different management objectives for the fishing fleets are assessed through a dynamic multi-species and multi-fleet bio-economic assessment model that include both species interactions and climate change. © 2015 The Authors.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,,CS - Baltic Sea,">100,000",decade,">100,000",year,Simulated dynamics,scenarios comparison,1,3,3,Baltic Sea,CS,Catch limit,Sustainability-Biodiversity protection,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Region level,"Bioeconomic modelling (BEMCOM, BEMTOOL, FLBEIA, MEFISTO, FISHRENT, Impact Assessment Models (IAMS), SMART, EFIMAS)",Unspecified,Large-scale,Number of vessels  _ Fishing Effort (days at sea) _ Landings (value) _Value Added (gross) _ Fish price _ Return on investment _Employment on board (crew)_ Fuel costs _Labor cost _ Capital costs _ Costs (fixed) _ Landings (volume) _ Sea Surface Salinity (SSS),Unspecified,Trawl,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Surveys were conducted in 9 major fishing locations along the Black Sea coast (from Istanbul to Artvin) between December 2008 and December 2011. Data provided from to the fishing operations have shown that bycatch rates as the proportion of bycatch weight to total catch weight were calculated as 30% for gill nets, 37% for purse seines, 62% for trawls and 19% for hydraulic dredges. Bycatch rates in number of fish basis were also detected as 34% for gill nets, 11% for purse seines, 62% for trawls and 23% for hydraulic dredges. All figures indicate that there is rather high impact of fishing gears on exploited stocks causing growth and recruitment overfishing. It is very important to reduce bycatch rates for sustainable fisheries by using more selective fishing methods. As a result of the comprehensive surveys, some practical management advices was provided for the fisheries management authority in order to increase selectivity of the gears and reduce bycatch rates for the sustainable of the living resources in the Black Sea. © Published by Central Fisheries Research Institute (CFRI) Trabzon, Turkey.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,,Black Sea,">100,000",five year,"10,000-50,000",five year,Fisheries Dependent Data,Average,2,2,2,Black Sea,non-CS,Landing obligation,Species protection-Discard reduction,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Country level,Indicators analysis,By-catch rate,Various,Unspecified,Unspecified,Gillnets_Trawl _Seine _ Dredges,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

Models of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystem assessments (MICE) achieve this by representing interactions among a restricted number of crucial species in the ecosystem considered. MICE applications are question-driven, heavily dependent on available data for conditioning and aimed at addressing tactical issues. Here we present the development of a MICE for the central Adriatic Sea. This area is important ecologically and economically because it supports a commercial stock of Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus), and a nursery ground for European hake (Merluccius merluccius), as well as being subjected to high levels of fishing pressure. Here, Italian and Croatian bottom trawl fisheries mainly target Norway lobster while impacting juvenile hake. Single-species stock assessments for the target species indicate fluctuating trends between 2006 and 2013, as do the survey biomass trends of most of their prey, underlining the need for a multispecies management plan. The diet of the target species were examined and prey items partitioned into four groups. Consumption of prey groups by predators was modelled using a Holling Type II functional response. A modified biomass dynamic model was used to represent the prey dynamics, projecting them into the future for 10 years (2013-2022) and testing different management strategies, including a discard ban. The most effective management option was the protection of larger individuals, which led to a clear improvement in the stock abundance and spawning stock biomass of both hake and Norway lobster without significant adverse effects on their prey. The discard ban scenario appeared to have knock-on effects on both predators and some of their prey. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,,Scopus,,CS - Mediterranean,">100,000",decade,">100,000",year,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey,,2,2,3,Mediterranean,CS,Landing obligation,Stock recovery,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Country level,Model of Intermedi-ate Complexity for Ecosystem assessments,Unspecified,Large-scale,Unspecified,Biomass _ Fishing mortality _ Prey preference probability _ survival probabilities of discard _ Biomass,Trawl_Longlines,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

In a deterministic dynamic framework, we consider a fish stock with two age groups, juveniles and adults, exploited by two countries having a different impact on the age groups. A regulatory agency defines an annual total allowable catch and its allocation between the two countries. We consider allocations satisfying a set of constraints representing viability conditions. The constraints include a minimal quota and minimal profit for each country. We compare intertemporal viable trajectories with the trajectory resulting from a cooperative game in which the two countries agree on the maximization of the fishery's total profit. While the cooperative solution consists in allocating the whole fishing effort to the most efficient country, the viable solution ensures a limitation of inequalities but reduces the overall economic outcome.

Using a mixed-method approach to investigate the partially obscured social, economic and political dynamics which drive marine policy, we demonstrate how the coastal fisheries have become subject to multiple-use competition arising primarily from a burgeoning recreational fishing sector tha t has benefited from ""access-enabling policies,"" and is, to a great extent uninhibited by fish conservation regulations.

The effects of changes in yearly TACs, and thus catch shares, vessel size (length) and vessel age on fish quality were also investigated. A data set consisting of objective quality assessments of Atlantic cod in 432 catches from the coastal cod fishery in Norway, combined with details about the same catches was analyzed. The statistical analysis showed that fishing gear affected fish quality, but to a variable degree, with gillnets and Danish seines, the preferred methods in this fishery, providing the poorest-quality fish. It was also found that catch size had a negative impact on fish quality for gillnets, handlines, and Danish seines, but not for longlines. The results indicate that fishers tactical decisions regarding what fishing gear to use, and how swiftly and intensely to fish, may lead to poor-quality fish being landed. Although this may be economically rational for fishers in a fishery with no restrictions on the choice of fishing gear and catch sizes, and where quality-based pricing is largely absent, it may lead to a substantial reduction in value-adding opportunities in downstream processing and marketing. © 2021 The Authors",English,Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,,NE-Atlantic,Unspecified,year,,year,Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey,Regressions,2,2,2,NE-Atlantic,non-CS,Unspecified,Unspecified,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Region level,Regression analysis,Unspecified,Large-scale,Landings (volume),Landings quality,Longlines_Handlines_Seine_Gillnets,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

We focused on the flatfish fishery in the North Sea and explored how spawning closures for plaice and sole contribute to sustainable management of 4 target species (sole, plaice, turbot and brill). Seasonal patterns in fishing effort and catchability by age group and area were estimated to quantify the effect of different spawning closure scenarios on the selection pattern. The scenario performance was evaluated using indicators of stock status (spawning stock biomass), economic performance of the fishery (yield, revenue) and ecosystem impact (discards, bycatch of cod and rays, seabed integrity, fisheries-induced evolution). In a single-species context, spawning closures may be beneficial for the target species, while in a mixed fisheries and ecosystem context, negative effects may occur. A spawning closure for plaice combines positive effects on the plaice stock and the revenue with reductions of the negative impact for several ecosystem indicators and only a small negative effect on sea bed integrity. The effects did not differ when evaluated at current levels of effort or at maximum sustainable yield (MSY) effort. Tailor-made solutions are required that need to be developed in stakeholder consultation to trade-off the ecological and economic objectives. Mixed-species MSY was lower than the sum of the single-species MSYs. © 2012 Inter-Research.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,,CS - North Sea,">100,000",five year,">100,000",year,Fisheries Dependent Data,GAM  ,2,2,3,North Sea,CS,Marine Protected Area (MPA),Stock recovery,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Region level,Indicators analysis,yield per recruit analysis,Large-scale,Revenues (total),Unspecified,Trawl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

This implies slow recovery from low biomass levels and it is, therefore, important to manage these stocks correctly to avoid overfishing. However, these stocks are generally data poor, which it makes difficult to apply quantitative assessment models on which to base their management. The management strategy evaluation (MSE) approach consists in evaluating the performance of management strategies by simulation before their implementation. In the evaluation, the main sources of uncertainty in a fishery system and its management process should be taken into account in order to find robust management strategies. Thus, the MSE approach is relevant to the management of data-poor stocks. We used the FLBEIA software, an FLR library coded in the R statistical language, to conduct a bio-economic impact assessment of fisheries management strategies. We evaluated the performance of several management strategies in three different deepwater case studies using the MSE approach: beaked redfish (Sebastes mentella) in the Norwegian Sea, blackspot seabream (Pagellus bogaraveo) in the Strait of Gibraltar, and French mixed deepwater fisheries in the North East Atlantic.

This implies slow recovery from low biomass levels and it is, therefore, important to manage these stocks correctly to avoid overfishing. However, these stocks are generally data poor, which it makes difficult to apply quantitative assessment models on which to base their management. The management strategy evaluation (MSE) approach consists in evaluating the performance of management strategies by simulation before their implementation. In the evaluation, the main sources of uncertainty in a fishery system and its management process should be taken into account in order to find robust management strategies. Thus, the MSE approach is relevant to the management of data-poor stocks. We used the FLBEIA software, an FLR library coded in the R statistical language, to conduct a bio-economic impact assessment of fisheries management strategies. We evaluated the performance of several management strategies in three different deepwater case studies using the MSE approach: beaked redfish (Sebastes mentella) in the Norwegian Sea, blackspot seabream (Pagellus bogaraveo) in the Strait of Gibraltar, and French mixed deepwater fisheries in the North East Atlantic. In conclusion, we found that the S. mentella stock is very sensitive to the stock recruitment relationship chosen.

The appropriateness of the IA methodology currently in use is tested on the example of a small scale fishery in a protected area in the German coast in the Baltic Sea (Fehmarn island). The impact of the fisheries management measures is first assessed using the available data and the results are then checked with the local fishermen and a producer organization representative using a focus group. Given the discrepancies identified in the focus group, additional methodologies are explored. By performing a literature review and a workshop with scientists, fishermen representatives, environmental organizations and managers, inputs from political science (the wicked problem approach) and philosophy of science (the NUSAP matrix) are applied to cope with the context of high uncertainty driven by poor ecological, economic and social data. This case study brings the opportunity to identify challenges as the assessment of biodiversity and potentially conflictive differences in national policy objectives under different EU policies (including the Common Fisheries Policy), in a way that goes beyond the contribution of other commonly used management tools as impact assessment and spatial planning. The usefulness of the approach resides both in a better identification of impacts on small scale fisheries and the unveiling of hidden governance conflicts that prevent the fulfilment of the objectives of policy measures. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,,Scopus,,CS - Baltic Sea,Unspecified,Unspecified,,,,,,,,Baltic Sea,CS,Seasonal closure,Sustainability-Biodiversity protection,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Individual,"Bioeconomic modelling (BEMCOM, BEMTOOL, FLBEIA, MEFISTO, FISHRENT, Impact Assessment Models (IAMS), SMART, EFIMAS)",Unspecified,Small-scale,Revenues (total),Unspecified,Gillnets,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Unlike most of the literature on resource economics, but in line with ecological models, we allow the different biological processes of survival and recruitment to be affected differently by environmental uncertainties. We show that the overall effect of uncertainty on the optimal size of a fish stock is ambiguous, depending on the prudence of the value function. For the case of a risk-neutral fishery manager, the overall effect depends on the relative magnitude of two opposing effects, the 'convex-cost effect' and the 'gambling effect'. We apply the analysis to the Baltic cod and the North Sea herring fisheries, concluding that for risk neutral agents the net effect of environmental uncertainties on the optimal size of these fish stocks is negative, albeit small in absolute value. Under risk aversion, the effect on optimal stock size is positive for sufficiently high coefficients of constant relative risk aversion. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,,CS - Baltic Sea,Unspecified,Unspecified,,,,,,,,Baltic Sea,CS,Effort Control,Fleet Efficiency ,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Unspecified,Generalized Linear Models,Unspecified,Unspecified,Profit (gross),Unspecified,Unspecified,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In both species, the landings by commercial category (proxy for fish size) and total landings determined the daily price fetched at the auction, as summarized by the quantity and scale coefficients (flexibilities) derived from the inverse demand model. In general, quantity flexibilities were between ?0.1 and ? 0.6, indicating that a 1% increase in the landings of one category (for a given species) would reduce the average daily ex-vessel price by 0.10.6%. Scale flexibilities were generally lower than ? 1, showing that these species tend to behave non-homothetically, especially for the large size categories. These results imply that changes to the quantities landed and the size composition of landings, resulting for instance from fisheries management measures, will affect sale prices. Simulations of sale price for scenarios of reduced landings, in line with fishing at maximum sustainable levels, showed that losses in revenue would be much less than the losses projected with constant prices. Similarly, higher landings resulting from rebuilt stocks would yield lower revenues from these stocks because of the generally negative flexibilities. © 2021 The Authors",English,Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,,Mediterranean - non CS,">100,000",five year,">100,000",five year,,,,,,Mediterranean,non-CS,Unspecified,Improved fishery management,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Individual,Price flexibility (RIDS model),Unspecified,Large-scale,Unspecified,Unspecified,Trawl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Multi-zone Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are often advocated to reconcile conservation and fisheries benefits. However, while there is a consensus about the ecological benefits whether such types of MPAs can really provide both benefits is still uncertain. Here, we analysed three existing Northwestern Mediterranean multi-zone MPAs (Cerbère-Banyuls, Cap de Creus and Medes Islands) using a comparative temporal ecosystem modelling approach to assess their effectiveness over time in recovering marine resources and ecosystem in the area. Our results showed differences in the ecological effectiveness of the three MPAs, potentially driven by MPA design, management and implementation features. Temporal increases of benefits were small, whenever detected, and showed slight recoveries of some target species and ecological indicators, mostly in Cerbère-Banyuls and Medes Islands MPAs. Our results confirm the benefits of protection to coastal marine resources and ecosystems when MPAs are enforced but highlight the current limitations of the three MPAs due to their small size and the significant impacts of small-scale and recreational fisheries. This study illustrates the capability to evaluate protection effects of small multi-zone MPAs with an ecosystem modelling perspective and represents the baseline to develop future scenarios of alternative management options to foster ecosystem recovery and resource rebuilding in the studied MPAs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,,Mediterranean - non CS,"50,000-100,000",Unspecified,"10,000-50,000",year,,,,,,Mediterranean,non-CS,Marine Protected Area (MPA),Species protection-Discard reduction,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Unspecified,Ecopath,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Biomass,Unspecified,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The ecological and economic consequences of this controversial regulation are evaluated here using an ecosystem model for the North-Eastern Adriatic Sea to quantify the long-term stocks' biomass, landings, and fisheries revenues under future scenarios with and without landing obligation. Results indicate that landings will increase by +13%, causing an increase in fishermen workload, reduction of biomasses at sea (?-0.20%) for species of both commercial and non-commercial interest, thus a small decrease in fisheries revenue (?-0.50%). Selling landed unwanted catches for fishmeal production will not compensate the economic losses. Additional adaptation scenarios were tested: (i) introduction of quotas for small pelagics, (ii) reduction of effort for bottom trawlers, (iii) improvement of gear selectivity, and (iv) a combination of (i) and (iii). Improving selectivity and introducing quotas resulted the best alternative but none of the adaptation scenarios compensated the adverse effects of the landing obligation, suggesting that this management measure has ecological and economic negative effects in systems where fisheries are not regulated by quota such as the Mediterranean Sea. © 2018 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

The impact of codend-related changes (mesh size and shape) and the introduction of a sorting device (sorting grid system) on the main target crustacean species (deepwater rose shrimp Parapenaeus longirostris and Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus) and the main fish bycatch species (blue whiting Micromesistius poutassou, horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus, and European hake Merluccius merluccius) were evaluated. Horse mackerel was the only fish species for which changing codends negatively affected landings per unit of effort by large percentages. The use of a sorting grid system, only evaluated for blue whiting and Norway lobster, led to a strong decrease in landings per unit of effort, especially for the former species. The impact of gear alterations was negligible on fish spawning-stock biomass, but was significant for crustaceans, particularly rose shrimp.

This detailed documentation of the fishing practices is used in spatial modelling tools to improve advice and research for fisheries. The tools integrate detailed information on vessel distribution, catch and fuel consumption for different fisheries with a detailed resource distribution of targeted stocks from research surveys to evaluate the optimum consumption and efficiency to reduce fuel costs and the costs of displacement of effort. The energy efficiency for the value of catch per unit of fuel consumed is analysed by merging the questionnaire, logbook and VMS (vessel monitoring system) information. Logic decision trees and conditional behaviour probabilities are established from the responses of fishermen regarding a range of sequential hypothetical conditions influencing their trip decisions, covering the duration of fishing time, choice of fishing ground(s), when to stop fishing and return to port, and the choice of the port for landing. Fleet-based energy and economy efficiency are linked to the decision (choice) dynamics. Larger fuel-intensive but efficient vessels conducting pelagic or industrial fishing are more inclined to base their decision on fish price only, while numerous smaller and less efficient vessels conducting demersal mixed or crustacean fishery usually consider other flexible factors, e.g., the potential for a large catch, weather, previous knowledge and experience, and the distance to/from port, which affect the number and duration of trips and the fuel consumption. Integration of the results into our recently developed spatially explicit individual-based fishing vessel model (IBM) incorporate the variability and predict the adaptations of individual fishermen to resource availability dynamics, increasing fuel prices, changes in regulations, and the consequences of socioeconomic external pressures on harvested stocks.

The trend of these indicators over the last decade highlights a poor economic performance that is associated with an overall poor condition of the state of resources. The trend of economic performance indicators is put in relation, on a time-based approach, with the different types of management measures applied over the last decade. We show that trends of fishing effort and economic indicators as well as statistical analysis return a coherent interpretation of the main factors affecting the profitability levels of the selected fleets. The study reveals that management measures impacted negatively on the profitability of the sector in the short run. However, economic indicators inverted the trend in the last 3 years. An increasing biomass trend as well as the improvement in fishing mortality of some few stocks, together with the reduction of input costs could be considered as positive drivers which impacted positively on economic profitability of the fisheries concerned. The study argues that even the technical and fishery management provisions in the Mediterranean Sea may have started to reverse the trend in economic profitability of the analyzed fleets. An additional management effort needs, however, to be developed on an urgent basis in order to ensure the achievement of the management goals defined by the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). © 2017 Sabatella, Colloca, Coppola, Fiorentino, Gambino, Malvarosa and Sabatella.",English,Review,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,,CS - Mediterranean,"10,000-50,000",decade,"10,000-50,000",year,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey,GLS model,2,2,2,Mediterranean,CS,Unspecified,Unspecified,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Country level,Generalized Linear Models,Unspecified,Large-scale,Return on investment _Return on Fixed Tangible Assets,Unspecified,Trawl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

This paper reports on a choice experiment survey to evaluate fisher's preferences for various management measures proposed under the EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) reform process, but the conclusions have wider relevance as similar measures are used by comparable fleets in fisheries globally. The survey was conducted with fishers involved in mixed pelagic and demersal fisheries in Ireland, pelagic fisheries in Denmark and demersal fisheries in Greece. Fisheries management policies were characterized by five attributes designed both to cover the principal CFP reform proposals and to integrate ecological, social, economic and institutional factors affecting fisher's decisions. The study uses a random utility modelling framework to reveal the preferences of the fishers across the alternative policy attributes. Results show that while there are generally preferences both for healthy stocks and for maintaining the importance of fishing to the local community, strong interfishery preference differences exist.

We developed a framework to anticipate the cost-effectiveness of several fisheries management options, including space-time closures, gear selectivity improvements, and fishing effort reduction of eastern Ionian Sea fisheries. We also examined to what extent these fisheries could be influenced by placing new aquaculture sites into specific areas. We used a dynamic space-time model considering the effect of possible fishing effort displacement on alternative marine areas. A fine-scale distribution of 6 species of high commercial importance, for the eastern Ionian fisheries (central Mediterranean), was used together with the fishing effort distribution of trawlers, purse-seines, and small-scale fisheries to track the implications on several bio-economic indicators. The study revealed that the stocks and the fisheries economics benefited from a 10% reduction in fishing effort for all fishery sectors, while the unwanted fish catch was slightly higher. Thus, although there are notable advantages, this management option is not sufficient to support an EU regulatory framework aiming to promote more selective fishing practices and mitigate unwanted catches. However, we showed that the protection of juveniles, by imposing selectivity improvements or space-time closures on trawlers, slightly reduced the unwanted catch. Nevertheless, the benefit for the majority of stocks and fisheries economics, during the five-year simulation period, was limited. In the case of space-time closures, this is attributed to the offset due to the fishing effort displacement towards other areas. While the benefit on fish populations by improving trawl selectivity, it depends on the species. Finally, the establishment of new aquaculture units could lead to a slight re-allocation of fishing effort along the border of the new sites without substantially affecting the profit of small-scale fisheries. Such findings are useful for fisheries management and broader spatial planning in the Ionian Sea. They will provide insight to policymakers and different fishing sectors, thus enabling a more transparent and participatory decisionmaking process. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,,Scopus,,Mediterranean - non CS,">100,000",Unspecified,,,,"dynamic, space-time explicit individual-vessel based model (DISPLACE)",,,,Mediterranean,non-CS,Marine Protected Area (MPA),Stock recovery,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Unspecified,Dynamic-state variable model,Unspecified,Large-scale,Fishing Effort (days at sea),Unspecified,Trawl_Seine,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

However, large-scale fisheries have grown tremendously, approaching an industrial sector in the last century, due to their socio-economic and political properties, including both national and international aspects. This progress towards industrial-scale fisheries led to the involvement of scientific research, first aiming to improve production efficiency, and then, to protect ecosystems as resources exploited for fisheries activity, by mitigating their adverse impacts. During this evolutionary progress, SSF was usually neglected because of their limited production ability, and thus minimal economic contribution, until the later phase when the protection of ecosystem resources gained sufficient importance. As a result of this, many countries lack data on SSF, under-mining efforts for the creation of proper policies for this type of fisheries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the productivity and the effects of some demographic characteristics, boat structures, and some cost (input) items on the net profit of SSF in the Black Sea. The eligible sample for this study consisted of 5575 small-scale fishing boats in the Black Sea. The number of fishers to be surveyed was determined as 315 using the Simple Random Sampling method, based on operators of boats < 12 m, i.e., boats in the SSF. Questionnaires were conducted face-to-face with fishers. In this study, it was tested if six parameters were investigated to determine whether they had a significant effect on net profit in SSF. These parameters were: (1) engine power; (2) number of fishing days; (3) boat length; (4) consumption of fuel in fishing; (5) education level of fishers; and (6) overall professional experience of fishers. To do so, Simple Linear Regression Analysis was performed to determine the effect of the data considered as independent variables when the net profit was set as the dependent variable. Atlantic bonito, Sarda sarda (Bloch, 1793); whiting, Merlangius merlangus (Linnaeus, 1758); rapa whelk, Rapana venosa (Valenciennes, 1846); and turbot, Scophthalmus maximus (Linnaeus, 1758) were the most important commercial fish species for small scale fishing. When catch per boat in SSF was evaluated, K?rklareli province ranked first with 97 007 kg, with Atlantic bonito (44 778 kg) being the most common species caught. Samsun had the second-largest catch per boat with 91 761 kg. The total net profit of 303 boats was calculated as 1 794 938 and the mean net profit per boat was 5924. The highest per boat mean net profit (25 909) was in K?rklareli. According to the results of the study, the number of days at the sea, boat length, engine power, and fuel cost had a significant effect on the net profit while education level and professional experience were not important in productivity. The economically-fragile SSF sector may need some kind of supporting subsidy. It would be beneficial to provide support to the majority of fishers active in the SSF in terms of complementary alternative employment opportunities in the regions where they are located. © 2021, Pensoft Publishers.

This fishery is experiencing a long period of crisis due to resource depletion and the lack of appropriate market strategies, and vessels spend most of the time searching for fishing schools. The searching strategy largely depends on the interaction between vessels: the captains of the PTM units take their decision also checking the position and the fishing status of other vessels. Understanding this strategy represents a key step towards a more effective resource management, since strategies directly determine the pattern of fishing effort. A Conditional Logit model has been devised to analyze fishermen's strategy as a non-cooperative game. This category of games is characterized by the existence of (at least) one equilibrium point - a Nash Equilibrium - in which each player plays his strategy, that is a Best Response to the strategies of the other players. This equilibrium point was estimated for the different scenarios defined by environmental (sea surface temperature and atmospheric pressure) and economic (fuel and fish prices at market) variables. Vessel Monitoring System data were used to capture fleet activity, while different datasets were collected to reconstruct environmental and economic drivers. Results indicate a good predictive power of the model, and suggest that the equilibrium strategy that guides units' behaviour is invariant with respect to environmental conditions, whereas it is largely influenced by economic factors. These latter, via strategies, may determine important consequences on the resources in terms of exploited areas and the impact of fishing activity. In particular, a low fuel price when fish price is high leads to higher values of CPUE, and then to a more efficient but also impacting fishing activity. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,,Scopus,,CS - Mediterranean,">100,000",Less than two months,"500-1,000",subday,Behavioural Observations,Game Theory,2,2,3,Mediterranean,CS,Unspecified,Unspecified,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Region level,Logit,Unspecified,Unspecified,Fuel costs_Landings (value),Fishing ground selection criteria_Location_date&hour_speed_heading,Trawl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

A large proportion of the purse seiners of the Adriatic fleet that target small pelagic species may be using gear that does not comply with regulatory provisions. This study provides a thorough overview on Adriatic purse seine designs and fishing practices. Moreover, since no detailed information was available about their environmental impact, an ad hoc study was also performed to examine the issue in relation to Mediterranean Regulation provisions. Analysis of the technical data confirmed the vast majority of the nets used by the Adriatic purse seine fleet do not comply with regulatory provisions. However, data analysis highlighted that the technical features and operational characteristics of these fisheries do not justify the application of MR restrictions. In fact, i) spatial analysis of the fishing effort demonstrated that purse seiners operate more than 3 nautical miles off the coast, i.e. further than the area covered by the restrictions; and ii) data from sensors and video cameras documented that purse seines do not exert adverse impacts on critical habitats such as Posidonia meadows and that the groundrope impact on the seabed is so slight and short-lived as to be negligible. Moreover, the extensive changes required to make purse seines compliant with the MR would entail steep costs and would ultimately render the nets unsuitable for commercial fishing, thus involving highly negative socioeconomic consequences. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,,Scopus,,Mediterranean - non CS,">100,000",Less than two months,">100,000",decade,"Data Storage, GPS, Acoustic Taggin",?,2,2,3,Mediterranean,non-CS,Marine Protected Area (MPA),Species protection-Discard reduction,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Various,Costs (other),Economic Performance,Seine,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

By combining results from semi-structured interviews with small-scale fishers and a bioeconomic model, we found that the percentage of discards for small-scale fisheries is usually low, which is consistent with general empirical observations globally but can be high when quotas are exhausted. Our results also confirm that the landing obligation would generate negative impacts on fishers' activities by investing more time on-board to handle previously discarded fishes, and putting at risk the security of fishers at sea due to full use of allowable storage on-board coupled with often adverse sea conditions in Galician bays. The application of the landing obligation policy to small-scale fisheries would result in short- and long-term losses of fishing days and yields, with high negative impacts on sustainable fisheries such as the Galician multispecies small-scale gillnet fishery. The expected number of fishing days under the landing obligation is estimated to be reduced by 50% during the five years following the implementation of the policy. The future yield (catches) under the landing obligation would be only 50% of catches expected in the absence of the landing obligation, regardless of the total volume of quotas allocated to the fleet. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,,CS - Western Waters,">100,000",Less than two months,">100,000",snapshot/no repeat sampling,Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey,bio-economical model,2,2,3,Western Waters,CS,Discard ban Policy,Species protection-Discard reduction,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Individual,Indicators analysis,Age-structures population model based on Baranovs catch equation,Small-scale,Fishing Effort (days at sea)_Profit (gross),Working conditions_compliance,Gillnets,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Recently the race for space in heavily used areas such as the North Sea triggered the proposal of co-locating other activities such as aquaculture or fisheries with passive gears in offshore wind farms (OWFs). Our interdisciplinary approach combined a quantification of spatial overlap of activities by using Vessel Monitoring System and logbook data with a stakeholder consultation to conclude and verify on the actual feasibility of co-location. In the German Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the North Sea up to 90% of Danish and 40% of German annual gillnet fleet landings of plaice overlapped with areas where OWFs are developed. Our results indicated further that the international gillnet fishery could lose up to 50% in landings within the North Sea German EEZ when OWF areas are closed entirely for fisheries. No spatial overlap was found for UK potters targeting brown crab in the German EEZ. We further identified a number of key issues and obstacles that to date hinder an actual implementation of co-location as a measure in the marine spatial planning process: defining the legal base; implementation of safety regulations; delineation of minimum requirements for fishing vessels such as capacities, quotas, technical equipment; implementation of a licensing process; and scoping for financial subsidies to set up business. The stakeholder consultation verified the scientific findings and highlighted that all those points need to be addressed in a planning process. In the German EEZ we have shown that the socio-economic importance of spatial overlap varies within planning boundaries. Therefore we recommend an interdisciplinary bottom-up approach when scoping for suitable areas of co-location. Hence, an informed marine spatial planning process requires comprehensive and spatial explicit socio-economic viability studies factoring in also ecological effects of OWFs on target species. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,,Scopus,,CS - North Sea,">100,000",two year,">100,000",year,"Data Storage, GPS, Acoustic Taggin",VMStools package,2,2,3,North Sea,CS,Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP),"Conflict avoidance (Economic, Social, Environmental)",Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Country level,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Landings (volume),Unspecified,Pots_Gillnets,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The socio-economic characteristics of small-scale fisheries have rarely been documented in the eastern Mediterranean. This study aimed to determine the current socio-demographic status, historical changes in demography and fishing activity, fishing expenditures, and the main problems of small-scale fisheries in the Aegean Sea. Material and methods. Data were collected in 2018, using face-to-face questionnaires from small-scale fishers (n = 190) representing three sub-regions (northern, central, and southern Aegean Sea). The questionnaire included information regarding the main characteristics of fishing vessels, demographic characteristics of fishers, expenditures involved, and other important issues. Furthermore, some demographic characteristics (e.g., age and marriage status) and fishery-specific characteristics (e.g., active fisher ratio) observed in our study, were compared to the published data, to reveal if any changes have prevailed historically. Results. The mean age of fishers was 50 ± 10 years, and many of them were married males with primary school education. The highest two fisheries expenditures were fuel and oil expenses and personnel (crew) expenses. The fisheries expenditures did not show a statistically significant difference in terms of geographical location. However, there was a significant difference in the total fisheries expenditures depending on fishery type; fishers who use an encircling net reported higher expenditures, in comparison to other fishing types. The results showed that the active fisher ratio and the ratio of fishers who do not have other income has decreased significantly over the last 10 years. In addition, engine power (kW) showed a significant increase over the last 1516 years. The main problems identified were insufficient inspection, illegal fisheries, and a decrease in stocks. Conclusions. Increased fishing expenditures and decreasing fish stocks in the Aegean Sea resulted in a decrease in the number of active fishers. Therefore, many fishers tended to have additional jobs, and some of them considered leaving fishing. To maintain the sustainable management of the small-scale fisheries in Turkey, we suggested that the catch and fishing effort should be monitored using the mandatory logbooks, and the hook number should be standardized. © 2020, Scientific Society of Szczecin.

The project sought to remove the barriers preventing more widespread use of the ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management by developing integrated ecosystem-based assessment methods and a decision support framework for the management of marine resources. The findings are intended to support the implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). The case study focused on the Icelandic cod fishery which is by far the most important fishery in Iceland, accounting for 43% of the country's total export values of seafood in 2016. Sound biological and economic management of the fishery is therefore essential for both the nation as a whole as well as individual fisheries-dependent communities. The analysis is done in two main steps. We first use the statistical multi-species model Gadget, developed by the Icelandic Marine and Freshwater Research Institute, to estimate the development of catches by fleet segments (trawl, net and longline) and stock size. Comparisons are made with two scenarios: a) adhering to the present harvest control rule or b) changing the effort to a level corresponding to fishing mortality associated with maximum sustainable yield (FMSY). In the second step, the two outcomes and their socio-economic effects are examined using a three-stage analytic hierarchy process. The case study has been developed in close cooperation with Icelandic stakeholders, and in this paper we describe how the co-creation approach was employed in an ecosystem-based fisheries management framework. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,,Scopus,,CS - North Sea,">100,000",year,"50,000-100,000",year,Fisheries Dependent Data,"Gaget model, multi criteria analysis",2,2,2,North Sea,CS,Catch limit,Stock recovery,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Country level,Gadget modelling framework,Unspecified,Unspecified,Landings (value)_Fishing Effort (days at sea),Economic Performance_Employment_Pollution_Damage to seabed,Trawl_Longlines_Gillnets,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Most of these catches are pooled into mixed-fish boxes (MFBoxes), which are usually labeled and sold as mixed-fish commercial categories (MFCategories). In this paper, we describe the MFBoxes and the MFCategories from the small-scale fleet of Mallorca Island in terms of species composition, size distribution and economic value. We used (i) daily sales records of MFCategories between 2004 and 2015 and (ii) a sample of 141 photographs of MFBoxes, collected over one year (20092010). MFCategories represent a non-negligible fraction of the landings, between 18 and 51 tons/year which represents 100300 K/year. Some of the sampled MFBoxes were sold as one of the three identified MFCategories, which differ in species composition, size and average price (3.9 /kg for the category LARGE MORRALLA, 2.2 /kg for SMALL MORRALLA and 7.0 /kg for VARIAT). However, more than half (52%) of the sampled MFBoxes were actually labeled and sold not as MFCategories but as one of the most abundant species in the box. This strategy might seem unprofitable because the market price is lower for MFBoxes sold as non-mixed categories than for non-mixed boxes of the same category. However, we observed that the label itself does not affect the selling price, but species composition does. Therefore, when sorting fish into boxes, fishers may be trying to optimize the tradeoff between not selling some low-priced fish and mixing them with other more valued fish. This alternative marketing strategy should be explored in depth and properly assessed, not only to maximize profits but also to promote a zero-discard European policy. © 2018",English,Article,,Scopus,,Mediterranean - non CS,">100,000",decade,"1,000-5,000",day,Fisheries Dependent Data,GLM,2,2,3,Mediterranean,non-CS,Landing obligation,Fleet Efficiency ,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Individual,Generalized Linear Models,Unspecified,Small-scale,Landings (value),Economic Performance,Gillnets_Trammel nets,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Consequently, it is also these decisions made by actors within seafood industries which ultimately determine the environmental impact of fisheries resource extraction from marine environments. In this study, we investigated the roles and influences of various actors within the Irish seafood industry. Our objectives were to learn more about the working dynamics of the industry and identify possibilities for improvements towards industry sustainability. We employed qualitative research methods including semi-structured interviews, focus groups and participant observation to access information from Irish consumers, retailers, wholesalers, scientists and key industry informants. The diversity of seafood products available within the Irish market is generally low. However, consumers who experiment with trying new varieties of seafood are influenced by dining experiences at restaurants or while travelling abroad as well as through cooking shows or cookbooks. Potential for influence on factors including consumer choice, stocking and sourcing decisions, business management and fisheries policy was found within all levels of the seafood industry, though a sense of responsibility in the context of seafood sustainability was less common. In addition, the absence of shortages within the Irish market due to imports, aquaculture and mislabelling appears to be preventing widespread acceptance about claims of overfishing. It is clear that ultimately, responsible policy decisions and effective enforcement will be needed to improve the overall sustainability of the industry. However, pressure for positive change can come from all actors that prioritise sustainability as the most important objective for future industry operation. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",English,Article,,Scopus,,CS - Western Waters,"50,000-100,000",Less than two months,,two week,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey,Qualitative Interviews,2,1,2,Western Waters,CS,Unspecified,Unspecified,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Country level,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

We analysed the abrupt reduction in fishing pressure of the mixed small-scale and industrial fisheries in the Catalan Sea, Spanish Mediterranean, and resulting ecological and economic impacts during the first half of 2020. We used detailed fisheries data on fishing effort, landings, revenues, landings per unit of effort (LPUE) and revenues per unit of effort from January to June 2020, and complemented it with the outcomes of a marine ecosystem model. We analysed data from 2017 to 2019 and compared these to 2020 to characterise changes in the fishing activity from before (JanuaryFebruary) to during (MarchMay) the lockdown. Fishing effort during the lockdown dropped by 34%, landings were down by 49% and revenues declined by 39% in comparison with the same period in 20172019. LPUEs did not show significant changes during the lockdown, with the exception of shrimp species, especially the deep-water rose shrimp, which significantly increased in LPUE during MarchMay. These increases may reflect positive effects of reduced fishing on fast-growing species. Positive effects mostly disappeared in June 2020 with the relaxation of the lockdown. In agreement, the ecological simulations projected slight short-term increases of biomass for fast-growing, small-sized organisms during 2020, which quickly vanished when fishing resumed, and which had no detectable ecosystem effects. Three additional alternative ecological simulations illustrated that to substantially recover commercial species and ensure ecosystem sustainability in the study area, a sustained and notable reduction of fishing activity would be needed. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,,Mediterranean - non CS,">100,000",two year,">100,000",month,Fisheries Dependent Data,Ecopath with Ecosim _ GLM _ Spearman rank correlation,2,2,3,Mediterranean,non-CS,Covid-19 pandemic restrictions - Lockdown,Unspecified,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Country level,Generalized Linear Models,Unspecified,Various,Landings (volume)_ Revenues (total) _ Fishing Effort (days at sea) _ Landings per unit Effort _ Cost per unit of fishing effort (CPUE),Unspecified,Trawl _ Seine _ Longlines,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

The Commission argues that this will create strong incentives for more selective fishing practices; however, there is little information to allow us to predict likely changes in fishing behaviour. Using detailed historic observer and logbook data from English North Sea otter trawlers and information on fish prices and landing costs, we examine the potential impact of a discard ban combined with either effort controls or catch quotas on the landings of an average trip. We calculate fishing incomes based on the assumption that existing fishing behaviour and catch compositions are maintained and compare this with incomes calculated on the assumption that all unwanted catch can be avoided. The difference provides an estimate of the maximum possible financial incentive for fishers to adopt more selective fishing practices. The calculations suggest that a discard ban in isolation will generate little economic incentive to operate more selectively. When combined with effort controls, a reduction in fishing effort may result in a proportional reduction in unwanted catches, but an incentive to actively avoid this catch is unlikely to be generated. Catch quotas would generate much stronger economic incentives, but only for the avoidance of the five quota species. So, contrary to the aims of the reformed CFP, a discard ban may not result in a dramatic reduction in unmarketable catches of all species. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,,Scopus,,CS - North Sea,Unspecified,two year,,two year,Fisheries Dependent Data,Management Scenarios,,,,North Sea,CS,Discard ban Policy,Fleet Efficiency ,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Unspecified,Indicators analysis,mean ratios of landing values_catch for different fleet segment under management scenarios,Large-scale,Fishing Effort (days at sea)_Catch (volume)_Landings (value)_Fishing capacity (Gross Tonnage),Unspecified,Trawl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

For the period 19902014, the analysis traces the development of relative quota holdings of the biggest actors operating large vessels as well as firms that employ smaller boats that are only allowed to use hook-and-line. A more detailed data set is used for the period 20012014 which allows for a more thorough investigation of consolidation in both fleet segments using Herfindahl-Hirchman Indexes, Gini coefficients and Lorenz-curves. The biggest firms in the two fleet segments increased their share of quotas throughout the period but the quota market is though still quite competitive. The distribution of quotas between firms has become more unequal, and there is also clear evidence of increasing transfers between harbours, especially in the case of the quota shares of hook-and-line boats. However, the results also indicate that spatial concentration has been much less than consolidation at firm level during the period under consideration. This would indicate that firms have mostly grown in size by merging with local firms or buying out smaller local operators. © 2016 The Authors",English,Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,,NE-Atlantic,Unspecified,multidecadal,,year,Fisheries Dependent Data,"GINI, HHI, Lorenzcurve",2,2,2,NE-Atlantic,non-CS,Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ),Fleet Efficiency ,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Country level,"HHI, GINI, Lorenz-curve",Unspecified,Various,Quota allocation,Unspecified,Hooks_Handlines_Longlines,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Furthermore, the adoption of a more selective bottom trawl design would increase the escape of undersize individuals and likely reduce fishing mortality of the target species, contributing to stock rebuilding and providing higher income to the fisheries operators in the medium to long term. © 2018 CSIC.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,,CS - Western Waters,"1,000-5,000",multidecadal,0-5,year,Fisheries Dependent Data,stochastic simulation for 4 scenarios; biological model based on MIX model,2,2,2,Western Waters,CS,Landing obligation,Fleet Efficiency ,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Unspecified,"Bioeconomic modelling (BEMCOM, BEMTOOL, FLBEIA, MEFISTO, FISHRENT, Impact Assessment Models (IAMS), SMART, EFIMAS)",Unspecified,Large-scale,Fish price_Profit (gross)_Costs (variable)_Cost per unit of fishing effort (CPUE)_Capital value of unit effort (CapPUE)_Costs (depreciation)_Labor cost_Catch (volume)_Landings (volume)_Fishing Effort (days at sea)_Crew share,Unspecified,Trawl,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

A major challenge for fisheries managers is to be able to anticipate how fishing effort is re-allocated following any permanent or seasonal closure of fishing grounds, given the competition for space with other active maritime sectors. In this study, a Random Utility Model (RUM) was applied to determine how fishing effort is allocated spatially and temporally by the French demersal mixed fleet fishing in the Eastern English Channel. The explanatory variables chosen were past effort i.e. experience or habit, previous catch to represent previous success, % of area occupied by spatial regulation, and by other competing maritime sectors. Results showed that fishers tended to adhere to past annual fishing practices, except the fleet targeting molluscs which exhibited within year behaviour influenced by seasonality. Furthermore, results indicated French and English scallop fishers share the same fishing grounds, and maritime traffic may impact on fishing decision. Finally, the model was validated by comparing predicted re-allocation of effort against observed effort, for which there was a close correlation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,,CS - North Sea,"500-1,000",two year,50-100,year,,Census,2,2,3,North Sea,CS,Unspecified,Stock recovery,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Individual,Random Utility Model,Unspecified,Various,Fishing Effort (days at sea)_Landings (volume)_Fish price,Competition_habits_Spatial constraints,Trawl_Seine_Passive gears_Dredges,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

To expose trade-offs between the fleets' objectives and to explore what a possible variant of a multispecies maximum sustainable yield (MSY) could look like, we parameterized an ecosystem model and subjected it to a range of different fishing effort levels of the three fleets. Long-term projections highlighted multiple fishing regimes that lead to catches of at least 30% of all focal stocks' single species MSYs at the same time. Trade-offs between the yields of shrimp fishers and demersal trawlers made higher simultaneous yields impossible. Besides optimizing multispecies catches, we identified effort regimes that satisfied a set of descriptors of good environmental status (GES). We found that GES can only be obtained through low efforts of beam and demersal trawlers, which cannot be aligned with our multispecies MSY variant without accepting trade-offs in fishing yields and/or conservation goals. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,,Scopus,,CS - North Sea,">100,000",multidecadal,">100,000",year,Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey,"No inference, straight calculation to the total population",2,2,3,North Sea,CS,Unspecified,Fleet Efficiency ,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Individual,Ecopath,Unspecified,Various,Consumption_Landings (volume),Respiration_Food quality,Trawl_Seine_Passive gears,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

In the present work, we focus on the multi-species demersal fisheries of the Aegean Sea (eastern Mediterranean) aiming to study the effects of different management measures on the main commercial stocks, as well as to explore the economic viability of the fisheries depending upon these resources, by means of simulated projections. Utilizing the limited available data, our results demonstrated that, under the current exploitation pattern, the economic viability of the fleets is threatened, particularly if fuel prices increase. Additionally, the biological targets set for the most exploited species, such as hake, will not be met under the current management regime. The projections also showed that the only management scenario under which both resource sustainability and economic viability of the fisheries are ensured is the decrease of fleet capacity in terms of vessel numbers. In this case, however, measures to support the fisheries-dependent communities need to be implemented to prevent the collapse of local economies due to employment decrease. Scenarios assuming selectivity improvements would be also beneficial for the stocks but they showed low economic performance and their application would threaten the viability of the fleets, particularly that of the trawlers. © 2016 Tserpes et al.

The current study, involving nine Geographical Sub-Areas (GSAs) of the Mediterranean Sea, focuses on the appropriateness, transferability and modes of applicability of a TFC system in the Mediterranean area. Three different scenarios of quota allocation have been analyzed by taking into account biological, ecological, environmental, economic and social aspects: quota in terms of resource quantity, quota as a portion of the total fishing time, quota as a portion of the total fishing capacity. Results show that the transferability of a TFC-based system to the Mediterranean context appears to be low due to the characteristics of the Mediterranean fisheries (multispecificity of resources, fishing grounds shared among different countries, multigear, importance of small-scale fisheries) and to the general lack of sound and reliable individual historical data. The study also highlights rights-based systems such as Territorial Use Rights in Fisheries (TURF) might only be applied for the exploitation of sedentary resources, such as clams. A management system based on TFC could be theoretically reasonable for anchovy fishing, where a few species are caught, even if all countries and stakeholders should be involved in the decision making process. © 2013 The Authors.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,,CS - Mediterranean,">100,000",year,"10,000-50,000",year,Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey,Not mentioned,1,3,3,Mediterranean,CS,Transferable Fishing Concessions,Stock recovery,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Region level,Unspecified,Unspecified,Various,Unspecified,catches_population dynamics_Stock Protection_Landings quality_effort_capacity_economic and social parameters,Trawl_Seine_Passive gears,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

The Thermaikos Gulf is a shallow gulf in the northwestern Aegean Sea (Greece) and one of the major fishing grounds of the northeastern Mediterranean concentrating high fishing effort of trawlers and purse-seiners and producing more than 20% of the total Greek catches. In the present work, we developed an Ecopath base model and ran Ecosim simulations for 26 years (20002025), including the calibration period (20002016), aiming to describe the food web structure and function of the Thermaikos Gulf, identify main components and interactions among the 33 functional groups, assess the ecosystem impacts of fishing over time, and compare ecosystem properties with other Mediterranean areas. Overall ecosystem degradation with biomass and catch decline was observed at the end of the calibration period due to the impact of environmental factors and fishing activities. The ecosystem seemed to stabilize in an intermediate state by the end of the projection years, but with an overall biomass and catch decline. Fishing effort reduction after 2016 resulted in higher biomass and catches compared to 20142015, that could not however reach the 2000 levels in most cases. The examined fishing effort reduction scenarios clearly showed that the more the fishing effort is reduced, the higher the biomass in the ecosystem and the lower the catches obtained compared to the baseline scenario. In a nutshell, since environmental drivers may be harder to predict or control, lowering the exploitation levels is an important step towards the rebuilding of overfished marine resources and more resilient ecosystems. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,,Scopus,,CS - Mediterranean,">100,000",multidecadal,">100,000",year,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey,,2,2,3,Mediterranean,CS,Unspecified,Stock recovery,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Individual,Ecopath,Unspecified,Various,Unspecified,Stomach content_Biomass_Immigration rate,Trawl_Seine_Passive gears,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

A representative number of in-depth interviews were carried out with ship owners and skippers of the fleet in question, to identify the envisaged operational and logistic problems on board and in port arising from the L.O. Furthermore, the current economic performance of the target fishing companies was analysed using the Input-Output methodology to identify their most significant activity costs. The combination of both research techniques enabled the evaluation of the potential consequences of the new L.O., concluding that, although it will generate minor positive and negative economic impacts, the main issue stems from the loss of quota.

Operating characteristics of the selected bottom-trawl fleet operating in the Bay of Biscay were analysed on a trip basis, from the technical, financial and market perspectives. The results show that, while this activity is technically possible, it cannot be considered a viable financial alternative to the existing commercial fisheries. However, the landing obligation of the European Union Common Fisheries Policy, to become fully operational in 2019, provides an economic incentive in the form of alternative trips. The fishing effort is to be limited by this regulation. Thus, the discouraging opportunity costs of fishing mesopelagic species might be alleviated by the effort limitation. Additionally, the existing markets might expand, and new opportunities for commercial fisheries of mesopelagic species might be created. The sustainability of exploitation and its impact on the ecosystem services associated with these species should be considered in their management. © 2018 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

The decadal mean price of fish (/kg, adjusted for inflation) rose from the 1940s until the 1970s, dropping thereafter. The yearly averaged economic income estimated for discards sales between 1969 and 2009 ranged from 419345 to 2164379. Discard ban sales could contribute from 10% to 53% of the total landed value and 934% of the total catches (landings + discards). Under a discard ban policy, the fishing sector with the largest economic contribution for total discards sales would be multispecies (54%), followed by trawl (26%) and seine (20%). On average, fishing sales contributed with 0.63% to gross domestic production (GDP) between 1938 and 2009. Discard sales can increase 1.071.46 times more than the fish landing contribution to GDP. After 1983 the average landings/imports economic ratio was 0.28:1, which means that fish imports surpassed landings economic value 3.57 fold. The discard ban policy can create economic opportunities in the national context thus helping to revitalize some specific fisheries sectors. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,,Scopus,,Mediterranean - non CS,">100,000",multidecadal,"5,000-10,000",year,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey,Time series analysis,3,3,3,Mediterranean,non-CS,Discard ban Policy,Fleet Efficiency ,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Region level,Indicators analysis,Contribution of Landings to GDP_Exportation/Importation,Unspecified,Fish price_Landings (volume)_Revenues (total),Unspecified,Trawl_Seine,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

Simulations were performed using a dynamic state variable model of effort allocation for the Basque trawl fleet, assuming that the landing obligation had been implemented in 2012. The three implementations of the landing obligation involved different policy arrangements: (i) quota increases; (ii) international swapping of quotas; and (iii) inter-species quota flexibility. All three scenarios resulted in changes to fishing patterns caused by choke species and improved selectivity of harvest, but also resulted in a negative short-term impact on the economic performance of the fleet. We report average reductions in net revenue of up to 60% when compared with results obtained under a no landing obligation scenario. Our model results suggested that these negative short-term impacts could be alleviated by incorporation of inter-species quota flexibility in the implementation of the landing obligation. Our results indicate that there will be a strong incentive to use this policy arrangement to alleviate the choke effect problem where species with limiting quotas constrain the fishery. © 2018 The Authors",English,Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,,Western Waters - non CS,">100,000",decade,">100,000",year,Fisheries Dependent Data,Dynamic state variable model,2,2,3,Western Waters,non-CS,Landing obligation,Unspecified,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Country level,Dynamic-state variable model,Unspecified,Unspecified,Costs (variable),Profitability,Trawl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

BEMCOM answers the question 'what's best?', i.e. finds the overall optimal effort allocation, from an economic point of view, between multiple harvesting fleets fishing under a subset of restrictions on catches and effort levels. The BEMCOM model is described and applied to the case of the Danish sandeel fishery in the North Sea. It has several times been suggested to close parts of the sandeel fishery in the North Sea out of concern for other species feeding on sandeel and_or spawning in the sandeel habitats. The economic effects of such closures have been assessed using BEMCOM. The results indicate that the model yields reliable estimates of the effect of MPAs, and can thus be a valuable tool when deciding where to locate MPA. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",English,Article,,Scopus,,CS - North Sea,"50,000-100,000",decade,"1,000-5,000",year,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey,Scenarios Analysis; Sensitivity Analysis; Simulations,2,2,2,North Sea,CS,Marine Protected Area (MPA),Fleet Efficiency ,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Unspecified,"Bioeconomic modelling (BEMCOM, BEMTOOL, FLBEIA, MEFISTO, FISHRENT, Impact Assessment Models (IAMS), SMART, EFIMAS)",Unspecified,Large-scale,Profit (gross)_Revenues (total)_Costs (total)_Costs (variable)_Fuel costs_Costs (provision)_Cost of Ice_Cost of sales_Labor cost_Costs (fixed)_Costs (repair & maintenance)_Costs (other)_Fish price_Employment on board (crew)_Catch (volume)_Fishing Effort (days at sea)_Number of vessels _Landings (value)_Landings (volume)_Discards,Age class of stock,Unspecified,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In Portugal, the European pilchard or sardine (Sardina pilchardus), which is mainly captured by purse seiners (?98%), is among the species most consumed (along with dried and salted cod), and commercially, it is the most important fish landed in national ports. Besides its consumption as fresh, canned sardine stands out among Portuguese seafood major exports. Although sardine has neither total allowable catch (TAC) nor quota, the Portuguese catch limits for sardine are regulated by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) at the request of the European Union (EU). Therefore, in practice, the ICES advice works as a theoretical TAC. The aim of this article is to diagnose the current state of sardine stocks in the areas where the Portuguese seine fishing is exerted and simultaneously assess if the structural changes induced on the purse seining fleet capacity, in response to the management system currently in force for this fishery, are aligned with its sustainable development. Our major findings conclude that sardine stocks are still exploited at levels that jeopardize the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). Once the unavoidable restructuring of the Portuguese purse seine fleet will inevitably increase unemployment among fishers, we also stress the need to reshape the current Community-Led Local Development (CLLD) program, funded under the EU fisheries structural aid, to make it more effective in minimizing the severe social impacts potentially coming out. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",English,Review,,Scopus,,Western Waters - non CS,">100,000",multidecadal,"50,000-100,000",year,Fisheries Dependent Data,None,2,2,1,Western Waters,non-CS,Total Allowable Catch (TAC),Stock recovery,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Country level,Unspecified,Unspecified,Large-scale,"Fishing capacity (Gross Tonnage), Number of vessels ",Profitability,Seine,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

This can be a challenge in multispecies fisheries. We used 21 biological traits of 86 species to investigate the relationship between-species and trait composition and to identify species with rare functional traits. Combining these traits with two catch datasets from the eastern Mediterranean (Patraikos Gulf: small-scale fleet, eastern Ionian Sea: entire multispecies fleet), we investigated whether certain fishing tactics or gears tend to remove specific traits, using multivariate methodologies. Species and traits composition of the catches were related, but an important part of trait variability was not explained by species composition. Rare traits and trait combinations were found for important target or bycatch species. Differences in the traits composition of fishing operations were revealed both between fishing tactics (Patraikos) as well as gears and areas (eastern Ionian); hierarchical clustering and MDS indicated the distinction of purse-seine catches at gear level. SIMPER analysis by trait indicated associations of certain trait categories mainly with purse-seines (at gear level) and longline mCrossed D signtiers and a trammel-net mCrossed D signtier (at mCrossed D signtier level). The identification of rare traits or their combinations can have significant management implications as overfishing of the species with these traits could result in altering assemblage functioning. It seems that the multispecies character of the benthic fisheries results in a balanced trait removal, while management should regulate the effects of purse-seine fisheries on the fisheries assemblage functioning. Further investigation of the functions that fishing may remove from the ecosystem could contribute to understanding the effects of fishing and reveal overlooked aspects useful for the improvement of fisheries management. © 2016 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,,CS - Mediterranean,">100,000",five year,">100,000",year,Fisheries Dependent Data,Mantel test_Bray Curtiss_MDS_PERMANOVA_SIMPER,2,2,2,Mediterranean,CS,EBFM,Species protection-Discard reduction,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Region level,ANOVA / PERMANOVA,Unspecified,Various,Unspecified,Sustainability-Resilience,Various,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

How fishers perceive and understand their membership experience is crucial to their capacity to learn from each other and adapt when interacting with their environment. These issues are explored by using the case of Propeixe, a Portuguese PO of purse seine fishers. Fishers 'perceptions' of their PO experiences are discussed using an analytical framework based on social learning literature. POs appear to stimulate social learning amongst fishers through changes in practices, economic and other incentives, rules and trust in leadership. Moreover, POs add to a simple market structure the properties of network coordination: interdependency and trust as a basis for co-operation. However, POs fail to change modes of interaction and communication amongst fishers. Within the PO network there are informal subnetworks, differing in terms of interests and influences, and disagreeing on problems (e.g. resource status) and on how to deal with them. By enhancing their members' social learning capacity, POs may increase their capacity to learn and cooperate with other actors in the sector. Leadership strategy, to encourage day-to-day dialog and deal with power relations, is essential in this respect. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",English,Article,,Scopus,,Western Waters - non CS,"50,000-100,000",year,"10,000-50,000",year,,Semi-structured interviews - so no match in column Y,2,1,2,Western Waters,non-CS,local engagement,Social equity,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Region level,Lit Review - Questionnaires - Surveys,Unspecified,Large-scale,Unspecified,Fishermens views,Seine,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

However, in the absence of enforcement, the proven effectiveness of a BRT alone does not guarantee its adoption by fishermen. Human factors also play a fundamental role. This case study was directed at evaluating the willingness of Sicilian longline fishermen to use relatively large circle hooks (size 16_0) as a BRT for the loggerhead sea turtle Caretta caretta. Fishermen were involved in testing circle hooks with their fishing vessels and their own commercial fishing gear, and their opinions before and after trials at sea were recorded. The present study showed the importance of creating a positive human context for testing a BRT. Findings provided additional confirmation about the usefulness of relatively large circle hooks to reduce the bycatch of loggerhead sea turtles on drifting longlines. Interviews before and after trials at sea indicated that socio-economic and emotional factors are essential for successful uptake of BRTs. Crews of large fishing vessels stated that they would be willing to use circle hooks in months with a high probability of turtle captures (June-September) if an economic incentive was provided and there was also public acknowledgement of their efforts.

Temporal variability in environmental performance of fisheries has only recently begun to be explored, but only between years, not within a year. Our aim was to better understand the causes of temporal variability within and between years and to identify improvement options through management at a company level and in fisheries management. Methods: We analyzed the variability in broad environmental impacts of a demersal freeze trawler targeting cod, haddock, saithe, and shrimp, mainly in the Norwegian Sea and in the Barents Sea. The analysis was based on daily data for fishing activities between 2011 and 2014 and the functional unit was a kilo of landing from one fishing trip. We used biological indicators in a novel hierarchic approach, depending on data availability, to quantify biotic impacts. Landings were categorized as target (having defined target reference points) or bycatch species (classified as threatened or as data-limited). Indicators for target and bycatch impacts were quantified for each fishing trip, as was the seafloor area swept. Results and discussion: No significant difference in fuel use was found between years, but variability was considerable within a year, i.e., between fishing trips. Trips targeting shrimp were more fuel intensive than those targeting fish, due to a lower catch rate. Steaming to and from port was less important for fuel efficiency than steaming between fishing locations. A tradeoff was identified between biotic and abiotic impacts. Landings classified as main target species generally followed the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) framework, and proportions of threatened species were low, while proportions of data-limited bycatch were larger. This improved considerably when reference points were defined for saithe in 2014. Conclusions: The variability between fishing trips shows that there is room for improvement through management. Fuel use per landing was strongly influenced by target species, fishing pattern, and fisheries management. Increased awareness about the importance of onboard decision-making can lead to improved performance. This approach could serve to document performance over time helping fishing companies to better understand the effect of their daily and more long-term decision-making on the environmental performance of their products. Recommendations: Fishing companies should document their resource use and production on a detailed level. Fuel use should be monitored as part of the management system. Managing authorities should ensure that sufficient data is available to evaluate the sustainability of exploitation levels of all harvested species. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",English,Article,,Scopus,,Norwegian Sea,"50,000-100,000",two year,"50,000-100,000",year,Fisheries Dependent Data,Kruskal-Wallis test,2,2,2,Norwegian Sea,non-CS,Fleet efficiency policies,Fleet Efficiency ,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Country level,Unspecified,Unspecified,Large-scale,Costs (operational),Sustainability-Resilience,Trawl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

This paper aims to analyse the evolution of fishing effort, landings and métiers in three trawling ports of the western Mediterranean between 2002 and 2011. Four métiers were identified, using multivariate techniques, in the fishery: Red mullet, European hake, Norway lobster and Red shrimp. The mean catch composition within the same métier was similar between ports, although the relative importance of species differed slightly from one port to another. Variation in fishing effort exerted was observed between métiers reflecting differences in the importance and usage of each métier by port. Temporal variations were found among different métiers at seasonal and annual scales. These temporal variations showed that métiers Red mullet and European hake were alternated. Positive significant correlations were observed between landings and different fishing effort variables with an exception of the relation between landings and engine power in the Norway lobster métier with negative significant correlations. Significant differences in total vessel length, gross tonnage, total CPUE and total income were detected among the four métiers depending on each port with few exceptions. These findings are considered a keystone for more practical implications and to assist fisheries' managers in the decision-making process. As demonstrated in the current paper, the management of multi-specific fisheries should start off considering the characteristics of each métier separately. In the sound of métier-based management, the patterns observed in the effort temporal distribution between métiers can indicate the most suitable time to reduce effort on specific target species. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,,CS - Mediterranean,">100,000",decade,">100,000",year,Fisheries Dependent Data,ANOVA,1,1,1,Mediterranean,CS,Effort Control,Species protection-Discard reduction,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Unspecified,Time series,Unspecified,Unspecified,Cost per unit of fishing effort (CPUE) _Fishing Effort (days at sea) _ Landings (volume) _Engine power,Metier,Trawl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

We contribute to the understanding of the relationship between management and the resilience of small-scale fisheries in developed countries by looking at these dynamics in the wake of the shock of stock collapse and fisheries closures in two contexts: Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, and northern Norway. We revisit and update previous research on the gendered effects of the collapse and closure of the Newfoundland and Labrador northern cod fishery and the closure of the Norwegian cod fishery in the early 1990s and present new research on young people in fisheries communities in both contexts. We argue that post-closure fishery policy and industry responses that focused on downsizing fisheries through professionalization, the introduction of quotas, and other changes ignored the gendered and intergenerational household basis of small-scale fisheries and its relationship to resilience. Data on ongoing gender inequities within these fisheries and on largely failed recruitment of youth to these fisheries suggest they are currently at a tipping-point that, if not addressed, could lead to their virtual disappearance in the near future. © 2013 by the author(s).",English,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,,Global,">100,000",multidecadal,">100,000",year,Fisheries Dependent Data,data mining and focus groups,1,1,1,Global,non-CS,Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ),"Conflict avoidance (Economic, Social, Environmental)",Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Unspecified,Lit Review - Questionnaires - Surveys,Unspecified,Small-scale,Unspecified,Employment,Various,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

High incidental catches, or the lack of selectivity, are some of the primary scientific criteria behind this discussion. This new framework is of particular interest in the region of Galicia (NW Spain) due to the social importance of small-scale fishing vessels using drift nets. In fact, over 400 vessels have a licence to capture European pilchard (Sardina pilchardus) with a fishing gear called xeito, which is a small-scale drift net. Methods: The main goal of this article is to provide stakeholders in the fishing sector with environmentally relevant results regarding the life cycle impacts linked to fishing practices performed by small-scale vessels using the xeito gear to target European pilchard. We hypothesize that environmental impacts computed with LCA will provide additional insights to the sustainability of the pilchard small-scale fishery in NW Spain, adding a series of criteria that may be useful for policy-makers to determine the consequences of forbidding this type of drift netting in the future. Results and discussion: Results show that environmental impacts across impact categories and operational activities do not differ much from that of other similar fishing fleets examined in recent years, with fuel for propulsion being the main environmental burden in most impact categories. When conducting a statistical analysis, no significant difference in energy use was identified between this small-scale fleet and purse seiners targeting pilchard in Galicia. Moreover, the results obtained demonstrate, in line with previous studies, that European pilchard is still an energy-efficient source of animal protein option as compared to demersal fish alternatives, crustaceans, or livestock. Conclusions: The results do not indicate that European pilchard landed with small-scale drift nets generates higher environmental life cycle impacts than pilchard landed by purse seiners in NW Spain. However, longer time frames for the analysis should be performed to attain results with lower uncertainty. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",English,Article,,Scopus,,CS - Western Waters,">100,000",five year,">100,000",year,Fisheries Dependent Data,LCA based on regional statistics and interviews,1,1,2,Western Waters,CS,Ban of certain fishing practices,Sustainability-Biodiversity protection,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Individual,LCA of the supply chain,Unspecified,Small-scale,Fuel costs_Fishing gear material_ Catch (volume),Unspecified,Driftnets,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The introduction of large-scale driftnets caused unwanted catches of protected species. Specific regulations were therefore issued in European waters, culminating in a proposed moratorium on SSDs. This study aimed to characterise the SSD fishery targeting anchovy (menaide), evaluating its environmental sustainability, economic performance and social relevance. In 2013, a survey by interviews, logbooks and observers on board assessed the order of magnitude of this fishery in terms of fishing capacity and activity, volume of landings and revenues. The menaide fleet consisted in 60 vessels <12 m overall length, moored in little harbours in southern Italy. These nets are highly selective: the target species, European anchovy, Engraulis encrasicholus (L.) and sardine, Sardina pilchardus (Walbaum), dominates the catches, while discards are negligible. The anchovies caught are of high quality and large size; the high prices support fish processing by local factories. Moreover, the results of a SWOT analysis demonstrated that replacing SSDs with a semi-industrial fishery, like purse seining, would increase impacts on the ecosystem, and a loss of socio-economic opportunities for several coastal villages. These findings support the option of keeping SSDs operating, in the framework of specifically oriented management measures. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",English,Article,,Scopus,,CS - Mediterranean,">100,000",decade,">100,000",decade,Fisheries Dependent Data,Interviews,1,1,1,Mediterranean,CS,Ban of certain fishing practices,Sustainability-Biodiversity protection,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Unspecified,Generalized Linear Models,Unspecified,Small-scale,Socio-economic data,Unspecified,Driftnets,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In this study, we investigated how stakeholders from important Blue Economy sectors along the German North Sea coast perceive the impacts of climate change on their daily work life and the growth of the Blue Economy. In a two-stage approach we first conducted two stakeholder workshops with representatives from the regional sea food sector, science, NGOs and local authorities, in order to identify important issues linked to climate change affecting environment, society, economy and policy. In the second stage, we conducted semi-structured interviews with key knowledge holders from the Blue Economy, to evaluate and validate the most important issues identified during the first stage, and the impacts on the respective sectors. The workshop participants identified perceptible effects of climate change on their marine environment. Early career scientists showed that they possess a clear focus on measures for climate change adaptation, transdisciplinary approaches and knowledge transfer. The interviews revealed that the climate change effects could be perceived as both negative and positive, depending on the sector. Other issues, especially political decisions and developments are perceived to have a greater immediate impact on the Blue Economy than the slow progress of climate change effects. Additionally, increased human activities, in the form of new or intensified uses like marine renewable energy generation, have a greater influence and lead to conflicts between the Blue Economy sectors. Our study showed that economic and societal stakeholders in Germanys North Sea region are aware of climate change and already perceive its effects on their businesses. Synergies and conflicts between the sectors and political decisions might influence sustainable growth of the Blue Economy in highly contested regions, such as the North Sea basin, much stronger than the effects of climate change. This calls for a more flexible and adaptive approach to policymaking, taking into account the changing environmental, social and economic realities. © Copyright © 2020 Hoerterer, Schupp, Benkens, Nickiewicz, Krause and Buck.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,,CS - North Sea,">100,000",decade,">100,000",decade,Fisheries Dependent Data,Conceptual model with Vensim software,1,1,1,North Sea,CS,Environmental measures and Habitats protection policies,Sustainability-Biodiversity protection,Social,Positive or Negative-based on the scenario,Region level,Lit Review - Questionnaires - Surveys,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Climate Change _ other sectors at sea _Management strategies,Various,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

There is an urge to better understand their impacts on marine organisms and develop reliable tools for biomonitoring studies, while also assessing their potential impacts on human health. Given their position on top of food webs, sharks are particularly susceptible to bioaccumulation, making them potential sentinel species of marine contamination. The main objective of this study was to find suitable biomarkers for future marine pollution biomonitoring studies by correlating biochemical responses with tissue contaminant body burden in blue sharks (Prionace glauca), a species heavily caught and consumed by humans, while also addressing their general health. The chemical contaminants analysed comprised different persistent organic pollutants (POPs) families from polychlorinated compounds to brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) and different trace and heavy metals. Concentrations of some contaminants in sharks' tissues were found to be above the legally allowed limits for human consumption. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was performed and some strong associations were found between biochemical responses and contaminants' accumulation levels. DNA damage and lipid peroxidation levels, as well as the inhibition of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase, were the main effects and consequences of contamination. The impact of contamination on these vital macromolecules underlines the suboptimal conditions of the sampled P. glauca, which can ultimately lead to the degradation of core ecological aspects, such as swimming, feeding, and reproduction. It can be concluded that P. glauca demonstrates great potential to be used as environmental sentinel and suitable biomarker candidates were identified in this work. Moreover, this study also highlights the risks that the consumption of blue shark derived products can pose to human health, which is of upmost interest as the sampled organisms were still juveniles and already presented values above regulatory limits. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,,Scopus,,NE-Atlantic,0-5,Less than two months,0-5,snapshot/no repeat sampling,Fisheries Dependent Data,canonical correspondence analysis (CCA),1,1,2,NE-Atlantic,non-CS,Unspecified,Unspecified,Social,Unspecified,Unspecified,Indicators analysis,persistent organic pollutants _ heavy metals,Unspecified,Unspecified,Persistent organic pollutants _ Heavy metals,Longlines,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The northern Adriatic Sea has been identified as an important marine mammal area because of a regular occurrence of common bottlenose dolphins. Boat surveys were conducted within a 3,000 km2 sector of the Adriatic Sea off the coast of Veneto, Italy, between April and October 20182019. Based on 76 days at sea, 10,711 km of navigation, and 81 h 26 min of dolphin tracking, this study contributes novel quantitative information on dolphin spatial distribution, and on their occurrence in the wake of beam trawlers, otter trawlers, and midwater pair trawlers. A combined generalized additive model and generalized estimation equation framework indicated that trawlingalong with other physiographic, biological and anthropogenic variablesinfluenced dolphin distribution. In days of trawling, the chance of encountering dolphins increased by ~4.5 times (95% confidence interval 1.811.0) near active beam trawlers, by ~16.0 times (7.136.0) near otter trawlers, and by ~28.9 times (12.069.6) near midwater pair trawlers. Spatial modelling was used to create maps of predicted distribution, suggesting differences in habitat use between trawling and no-trawling days.

After allocating the various fleet segments in these two groups by using a novel approach based on employment variables, we assess their societal value by using the extended cost-benefit analysis method, which considers both social and environmental criteria beyond economic criteria. The data used for the analysis are from the Greek National Fisheries Data Collection Programme and correspond to 726 vessels. In conclusion, the analysis provides evidence that small-scale fishing is linked to a family-run fishing activity model. In contrast, large-scale fishing is linked to a business-oriented fishing activity model. It was then estimated that family-run fleet segments provide a higher societal value for each ton of landings compared with business-oriented fleet segments. Finally, the degree of commercialisation of fishing fleet segments and the societal value per ton of landings are found to have a statistically significant negative correlation. This evidence indicates the prominent role of the family-run fishing activity to society and calling for increased attention by national and intergovernmental policy agents, and policy-makers have to enhance its role. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,,Scopus,,CS - Mediterranean,">100,000",year,">100,000",year,Fisheries Dependent Data,cluster analysis _ average _ Linear regression,2,2,3,Mediterranean,CS,Social policies ,Fleet Efficiency ,Social,Positive,Country level,Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA),Unspecified,Unspecified,Fuel costs_ Labor cost _ Costs (variable) _ Costs (repair & maintenance) _ Costs (fixed) _ Profit (gross)_ Landings (value),Unspecified,Unspecified,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In the southern Bay of Biscay, local French fishermen requested creation of a restricted area to help settle disputes between the various métiers operating there. This restricted area, which lies mainly in French waters, covers part of a deep submarine canyon off the French and Spanish coasts, known to have a large population of mature hake. This study aims to better understand the effects of a restricted area upon French fleets operating there, particularly upon three main métiers-longliners, gillnetters and trawlers. The study area includes three ICES statistical rectangles. The data, based upon reported landings and auctions sales for the period 1985-2008, were analyzed using multivariate analysis. The fishing activity is more important in one rectangle which includes the restricted area. Bottom longliners and gillnetters, operate mainly in this one while trawlers are less dependent. The first métier concentrates particularly on hake and the second has targeted other species and has become less dependent on hake. Trawlers target a wider range of species. Over the past ten years, the restricted area has contributed to maintain the fleets operating here. The border with Spain adds other constraints over the issue of access to regional fisheries and makes management a little more complicated. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,,CS - Western Waters,"50,000-100,000",multidecadal,"50,000-100,000",year,Fisheries Dependent Data,average _ PCA,2,2,2,Western Waters,CS,Marine Protected Area (MPA),Species protection-Discard reduction,Social,Positive,Country level,Unspecified,turn-over by vessel and bycrewmember(in k vessel-1 crew-1) _ turn-over by vessel and by fish trip (in k vessel-1 10 h-1) _ landing by vessel _ landing by crew _ landing by fishing trip,Various,Landings (volume),Unspecified,Longlines_Gillnets _Trawl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

These measures, however, have the potential to adversely impact the local employment and profitability of the fisheries. In this paper, we examine scenarios on the short term and long term levels of economic yield of the sector using the two main drivers of fuel price and employment. Three main scenarios are defined as i) maintaining the average status quo, ii) effort control regimes implemented in the 2019 multiannual plan, and iii) flexible effort control regimes. For each of the aforementioned scenarios, three main fleets and five main conditions are considered, and the results will be compared and contrasted. The results in this paper show that the future rise in fuel price, which is anticipated due to global efforts to reduce emissions, along with the current effort reduction strategies could significantly threaten the sustainable profitability of the sector, and policy measures that could balance this issue should be implemented. Policy interventions and investments should be directed at technological advancements such as modernisation and increasing efficiency of fleet to reduce fuel use, utilisation of highly efficient gear technologies, shortened trips to fishing grounds, and increase in value creation in other parts of the fisheries supply chain to mitigate the serious challenges in terms of local employment and profitability facing the Mediterranean fisheries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,,Scopus,,Mediterranean - non CS,">100,000",multidecadal,">100,000",year,Simulated dynamics,optimization,2,2,3,Mediterranean,non-CS,Effort Control,Fleet Efficiency ,Social,Negative,Region level,"Bioeconomic modelling (BEMCOM, BEMTOOL, FLBEIA, MEFISTO, FISHRENT, Impact Assessment Models (IAMS), SMART, EFIMAS)",Unspecified,Various,Costs (total)_Revenues (total),Profitability,Trawl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

This constitutes a serious impediment to assess the compliance level of Aichi Biodiversity Targets (ABT). The European Union has committed itself to include an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management (EAFM) in its Common Fisheries Policy. EAFM depends on suites of indicators that track the pressure exercised, the state of the ecosystem, and the socio-economic consequences of management objectives. Therefore, The Living Planet Index (LPI) is proposed here for describing the performance of SSF towards theABT.Weshowthat the LPI can be reformulated to track trends in Fishing Effort (LPIFE), trends in Fish Populations (LPIFP), and both the state and trends related to the contribution of fisheries to broader society (LPIDEB). The implementation of the LPI in SSF applies several principles of the EAFM, including decentralization, fishers participation, and consideration of local knowledge. In this paper, we used 10-year daily data from the Cofradýa at Palamós port, Catalonia-Spain. This is a multi-species SSF landing ca. 130 species, from which 10.9% are of special interest, being listed by the IUCN or in agreements by regional conventions. We observe a decreasing trend in the LPIFP, the LPIFE, and in the LPIDEB, including 36 species or groups, accounting for 90% of total landings, suggesting an overall decrease in the sustainability of this SSF. We conclude that use of the LPIFP is especially well suited to standardize the reporting of information for multispecies fisheries using a wide array of fishing strategies, and results strongly suggest the feasibility of using the LPI methodology to standardize reporting of any given agreed fisheries indicator in order enhance management towards the ABTs. © 2015 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

This paper explores these domains by examining lived experiences and daily realities in Icelands fishing communities, 30 years after the implementation of a national privatized Individual Transferrable Quota (ITQ) fisheries management system. Drawing upon ethnographic data collected over 2 years in the rural coastal communities of Northwest Iceland, we address three questions; 1) How the ITQ system relates to other complex social and environmental factors facing coastal communities today. 2) How attempts to alleviate negative impacts of the ITQ system have led to new rifts in communities and 3) how the decision-making power of a few dominant interest groups in national politics leaves small-boat fishermen and rural communities at a disadvantage. In the words of our study participants, the Icelandic fisheries management scheme has created little kings in rural communities, where each little king acts in his own best interest, yet has no recourse to collective power and no platform to influence national politics. In this volatile political situation with cross-scale implications, it is difficult for fishermen, their families, and community members to imagine ways in which power over and access to the fisheries resource can be redistributed. © 2017, The Author(s).",English,Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,,European Macaronesia,">100,000",two year,"50,000-100,000",half year,Behavioural Observations,no inference,2,2,3,European Macaronesia,non-CS,Total Allowable Catch (TAC),Stock recovery,Social,Negative,Individual,Lit Review - Questionnaires - Surveys,Unspecified,Small-scale,Unspecified,Social equity,Longlines,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Small-scale fisheries (SSF; fishing vessels up to 12 m in length) constitute the majority of the Polish fishing fleet. To integrate the spatial needs of the sector with the Maritime Spatial Plan during 201617, extensive research was conducted in the form of individual interviews using paper maps to determine significant fishing grounds and their relative importance. In total, 64% (n = 267) of small-scale fishermen were examined, which allowed the creation of a map depicting the spatial extent and relative importance index of fishery grounds. The map of the results showed that the highest values were obtained in the coastal zone of the Gulf of Gda?sk, where numerous small fishing bases are located. Along the central coast, the most important fishing grounds are adjacent to the largest fishing bases. The adopted spatial resolution facilitated assessing the scale of current and potential conflicts regarding the use of marine space by SSF and other sea users. The results of the survey concerning threats to the functioning of fisheries indicate that fishermen are primarily concerned about the impact of environmental protection. The participatory mapping process based on the ethical principles of social sciences has not only resulted in a new geo-information layer included into Polish MSP but also made it possible to learn about fishermen's concerns about current and potential spatial conflicts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,,Scopus,,CS - Baltic Sea,">100,000",two year,">100,000",two year,,interviews,2,2,3,Baltic Sea,CS,Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP),Improved fishery management,Social,Unspecified,Country level,mapping,Unspecified,Small-scale,Fishing Effort (days at sea)_Landings (value),Unspecified,Gillnets_Hooks_Traps,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The implementation of this new fisheries regulation urges the definition of standard monitoring protocols to track potential changes in the European fisheries. Importantly, this framework needs to be multi-dimensional to capture the ecological, social and economic components of the fisheries system. Aiming to address this challenge, a set of 39 candidate indicators were identified by means of literature review and expert consultation. Experts in European fisheries were gathered to discuss the selection of a restricted set of indicators and later, a remote survey was completed by the experts to assess the adequacy of the indicators against pre-defined quality criteria and to identify expected direction of change. Based on survey results, the candidate indicators were ranked according to their adequacy for monitoring of the landing obligation (LO) potential effects. This ranking was dominated by indicators related to the exploited species, rather than the social or economic dimensions of the fisheries. Because the LO is not yet fully implemented, experts expressed uncertainty in the properties of many indicators, particularly related to ecosystem properties and social system properties, and had divergent opinions on the effect of the LO on discard numbers. The feasibility to operationalize a monitoring framework with the prioritized indicators was explored with data from a Spanish demersal otter-trawl fishery. This exercise evidenced that most indicators can be routinely collected and that it would be feasible to track these variables over time in the framework of a monitoring program. However, gaps exist in the time series of the studied indicators, especially for the period after the LO implementation. This study can provide valuable baseline information for any future monitoring program, as its objective was the development of a methodological approach that contributes to science-based policy making and to indicator selection for fisheries management reforms. © 2019 Christou, de Juan, Vassilopoulou, Stergiou and Maynou.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,,CS - Mediterranean,">100,000",multidecadal,">100,000",multidecadal,,mix of methods,2,2,3,Mediterranean,CS,Landing obligation,Fleet Efficiency ,Social,Positive,Region level,Indicators analysis,Presence of sensitive species _ Diversity of by-catch species_Sensitive habitat presence and extent _ Population size of target species _Ratio of species low-high resistance to fishing-discarded fraction_ Ratio of species low_high resistance to fishing-landed fraction _ Proportion of target species larger than the mean size at first sexual maturation _ 95th percentile of the fish length distribution of each target species _ Productivity of trophic guilds _Proportion of large-bodied organisms (top of food webs) in the catch _ Abundance of functionally important trophic groups_species _ Diversity of functional traits Redundancy of functional traits_Mean trophic level of the catch _ Production for human consumption_ Ratio of revenues to break even revenue _ Production for non-human consumption_New fish processing plants _ Number of jobs created for full by-catch utilization by gender,Large-scale,Landings (volume)_Discards _ Revenues (total) _ Value Added (gross) _Return on investment _ Landings (volume) _Total Investment _ Fuel costs _ Costs (operational) _ Fishing capacity (Gross Tonnage) _ Fishing Effort (days at sea) _ Labor cost _Employment on board (crew),presence and extent of nursery areas for target species _end users'ability to modify fishing practices ,Trawl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Not exploiting fisheries resources at MSY or MEY leads to the loss of production and rents from the fisheries. A large part of the EU fisheries are managed based on single species stock assessments; however, in reality, most species are caught together with other species and by different fleets. In multi-species and multi-fleet fisheries, single species assessments, and consequently MSY and MEY reference points, are often not valid, and so the catch recommendations. In this paper it is investigated the MSY and MEY estimation in multi-species and multi-fleet fisheries in comparison to single species assessments. Analyses are applied to the Bay of Biscay demersal fishery using the IAM bio-economic model. The impact of exploiting at MSY and MEY on the optimal effort allocation between fleets with different exploitation patterns and economic structures is analyzed. When accounting for the multi-species nature of the fishery, MSY landings are 0.4% to 2.7% lower than the single species simulations estimates. When accounting for the multi-fleet nature of the fishery, MSY landings are 27.2% to 30.2% higher than the single-fleet estimates. When considering the multi-fleet characteristics, MEY landings are 6.6% higher and profits are 66.5% higher than in the single-fleet simulation. Optimal effort at MEY is lower than at MSY, but when accounting for multi-fleet the optimal effort decreases for some fleets while increases for gillnetters. The results also provide an estimation of the profits at MEY (or costs of not being at MEY). Profits can be then up to 10.7 times larger than the current profits (256 million Euros compared to the current 24 million Euros). © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,,CS - Western Waters,">100,000",multidecadal,">100,000",year,Fisheries Dependent Data,equilibrium model maximising either the landings (MSY) or the profit (MSY),2,2,2,Western Waters,CS,Total Allowable Catch (TAC),Sustainability-Biodiversity protection,Social,Positive,Region level,"Bioeconomic modelling (BEMCOM, BEMTOOL, FLBEIA, MEFISTO, FISHRENT, Impact Assessment Models (IAMS), SMART, EFIMAS)",Unspecified,Large-scale,Costs (fixed)_Costs (operational)_Costs (repair & maintenance)_Fishing Effort (days at sea)_Landings (Value)_Landings (Volume)_Value Added (gross)_Fuel costs_Labor cost_Number of vessels _Costs (variable)_Value Added (net),Biomass_Fleet efficiency_Economic Performance_Profitability_Sustainability-Resilience,Gillnets_Trawl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

It empirically investigates the past and present development of a small-scale fjord fishery in Porsanger, northern Norway, which has been a major part of the material basis for indigenous Sami culture and settlements in the area. The article utilises historical vessel registries and fishers vessel career narratives from the post-war period to the present to analyse how relations between vessels, fishers, technology, ecology and the society at large have changed, and to what extent the small-scale fishery of the past seems to be disappearing in a fisheries system characterised by increasing cyborgization especially in the period after 1990. The main finding is an identification of diverse ways of organising the small-scale fishery in Porsanger in the past which had an influence on which types of vessels and fishers stayed put in the post-1990 period. This process was influenced not only by the introduction of the vessel quota system but also by ecological conditions and changing social and material relations in the local fisheries. In particular, the fishery with small open vessels with outboard engines experienced a golden age prior to the 1990s, but then abruptly decreased due to a combination of ecological conditions and management interventions. The fishery with decked, coastal fishing vessels however remained relatively stable throughout the period and continues to dominate the Porsanger small-scale fishery. The case study demonstrates diverse and flexible ways of organising relations in a coastal Sami community over time, thus implying that a cybernetic future may be possible also for small-scale fisheries. © 2014, Brattland; licensee Springer.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,,Norwegian Sea,"50,000-100,000",multidecadal,"50,000-100,000",multidecadal,,"interviews, mapping",2,2,3,Norwegian Sea,non-CS,Fleet efficiency policies,Multiple objectives,Social,Unspecified,Region level,Unspecified,Unspecified,Small-scale,Number of vessels ,Adaptive Capacity_Coastal development_Culture_Resilience,Gillnets,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

One of the quantitative methods available to advance in the process of validating simulation models is global sensitivity analysis (GSA). However, its use in fisheries management has been very limited. When GSA is applied to management strategy evaluation implementations, it can also help manage available resources efficiently with respect to uncertainty in the management process and the conditioning of simulation models. Mixed-fisheries management plans were recently implemented for demersal fisheries in the Northeast Atlantic, which were evaluated previously using complex bioeconomic models. Here, we applied GSA to the model used in Iberian waters, employing an efficient model design to introduce uncertainty in every single input factor. While most biological factors contributed significantly to the variance of results, only few economic factors did. Moreover, we found that increasing accuracy in the stock assessment process would mainly impact management advice and that only the management of target stocks had a real impact on the system. This highlights the importance of properly managing hake (Merluccius merluccius), which is currently managed using an empirical harvest control rule. © 2021 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2021.",English,Article,,Scopus,,CS - Western Waters,">100,000",five year,">100,000",year,Fisheries Dependent Data,Global sensitivity analysis,2,2,2,Western Waters,CS,Total Allowable Catch (TAC),Stock recovery,Social,Unspecified,Region level,"Bioeconomic modelling (BEMCOM, BEMTOOL, FLBEIA, MEFISTO, FISHRENT, Impact Assessment Models (IAMS), SMART, EFIMAS)",Unspecified,Large-scale,Fishing Effort (days at sea)_Value Added (gross)_Number of vessels _Profit (gross),Unspecified,Trawl_Gillnets_Longlines,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

In France, where fishing allocations are non-transferable, quotas are shared among Producer Organizations (POs) based on the historical landings of their members. Each PO is then responsible for implementing their own internal rules that provide individual or collective allocations to their members. This study investigates the distributional effects of the various quota management systems adopted by POs on quotas and production for the Bay of Biscay sole fishery. A comparison between initial allocations by vessel based on historical landings and actual observed landings is presented. Inequality metrics are used to quantify distributional effects, and a new method that is based on the decomposability property of the Theil index is introduced. Results show that the French management system successfully avoided concentration of production while reducing the fishing capacity through decommissioning schemes. The non-transferability of fishing allocations is a critical element that favored this outcome by allowing POs to control the distribution of catch shares in the fishery. Besides, it appears that the allocation strategies developed by POs were notably influenced by their local roots and their fishing fleet profiles. The various quota allocation systems among POs had contrasting effects on vessels' production, including greater equity within particular subfleets, benefits to vessels most dependent on sole in most POs, and benefits to the small-scale fisheries in a few POs. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,,CS - Western Waters,">100,000",decade,">100,000",year,Fisheries Dependent Data,inequality metrics using Theil index,2,2,2,Western Waters,CS,Allocation of rights,Social equity,Social,Positive,Region level,Theil index,Unspecified,Various,Landings (volume),Social equity,Trawl_Gillnets,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

However, emissions from fishing grew by 28% from 1990 to 2011 and fishing currently contributes about 4% of the emissions of world food production. The purpose of this paper is to identify the relationship between various factors and emissions in fisheries. We analyse the development of CO2 emissions from the Icelandic individual transferable quota regulated fishing fleet from 1997 to 2018. The results show that emissions per unit of catch fell around 40% during this period. The main findings are that overall catches and abundance are by far the most important factors determining emissions, the bigger the catches and the greater the abundance, the smaller the emissions per unit of output. Fuel prices are a distant third factor and technological change has played a minor role in this development. In addition, the importance of different factors affecting emissions, varies between vessels depending on types of fishing gear. The results indicate that building up fish stocks not only increases output but also increases profitability and reduces emissions per unit of output, as long as the fisheries management system preserves incentives for efficient fishing. © 2021 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2021.",English,Article,,Scopus,,NE-Atlantic,">100,000",multidecadal,">100,000",multidecadal,Fisheries Dependent Data,behavioural model,2,2,3,NE-Atlantic,non-CS,Total Allowable Catch (TAC),Sustainability-Biodiversity protection,Social,Positive,Region level,Cobb Douglas production technology,Unspecified,Various,Fishing Effort (days at sea)_Fuel costs_Landings (volume)_Fuel costs_Number of vessels ,Profitability-Pollution-Fleet efficiency,Trawl_Gillnets_Longlines,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Excess fishing effort leading to the degradation of fishery resources and significant economic waste is globally recognized by resource managers as a major problem for the implementation of the EAF and European's Union Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). Knowledge of how fishers allocate their fishing effort in space and time is essential to understand how a fishery develops. Understanding fishing strategies is also vital for predicting how a fishery might respond to proposed management changes such as effort/area restrictions and introduction of a marine protected area, and for drawing up a management policy. Random utility models were used to examine the factors affecting fishers' behaviour in the NE Mediterranean. The probability of selecting a specific fishing rectangle was estimated using monthly purse seine data. The predictive inputs concerned both subjective behavioural and objective seasonal and technical-economic characteristics.

In task one, we applied the Bayesian belief network methodology to elicit the causal assumptions of six stakeholders on factors that influence natural mortality, growth, and egg survival of the herring stock in probabilistic terms. We also integrated the expressed views into a meta-model using the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method. In task two, we used influence diagrams to study qualitatively how the stakeholders frame the management problem of the herring fishery and elucidate what kind of causalities the different views involve. The paper combines these two tasks to assess the suitability of the methodological choices to participatory modeling in terms of both a modeling tool and participation mode. The paper also assesses the potential of the study to contribute to the development of participatory modeling practices. It is concluded that the subjective perspective to knowledge, that is fundamental in Bayesian theory, suits participatory modeling better than a positivist paradigm that seeks the objective truth. The methodology provides a flexible tool that can be adapted to different kinds of needs and challenges of participatory modeling. The ability of the approach to deal with small data sets makes it cost-effective in participatory contexts. However, the BMA methodology used in modeling the biological uncertainties is so complex that it needs further development before it can be introduced to wider use in participatory contexts. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",English,Article,,Scopus,,CS - Baltic Sea,Unspecified,two year,,,,,2,,3,Baltic Sea,CS,Ban of certain fishing practices,Improved fishery management,Social,Unspecified,Unspecified,Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN),Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,"Trasnational focus group was build (managers, environmental Ngo's, fishers representatives and scientists)",Unspecified,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

These two fishing methods are fundamentally different and have different economic, environmental, and even social effects. In this paper we present a hybrid-simulation framework to assess the impact of changing the ratio between cod quota allocated to vessels with longlines and vessels with bottom trawls. It makes use of conventional bioeconomic models and discrete event modelling and provides a framework for simulating life cycle assessment (LCA) for a cod fishery. The model consists of two submodels, a system dynamics model describing the biological aspect of the fishery and a discrete event model for fishing activities. The model was run multiple times for different quota allocation scenarios and results are presented where different scenarios are presented in the three dimensions of sustainability: environmental, social, and economic. The optimal allocation strategy depends on weighing the three different factors. The results were encouraging first-steps towards a useful modelling method but the study would benefit greatly from better data on fishing activities. © 2014 Sigríur Sigurardóttir et al.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,,NE-Atlantic,Unspecified,Unspecified,,,,,3,,3,NE-Atlantic,non-CS,Environmental measures and Habitats protection policies,Unspecified,Social,Unspecified,Unspecified,LCA of the supply chain,Unspecified,Large-scale,Unspecified,Unspecified,Trawl_Longlines,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Pot fishing, is a growing sector in the UK and evidence of any impacts is needed to inform management. This study simulated high intensity experimental pot fishing on the epibenthos of two common UK reef habitats in Northumberland, UK. Single tethered pots were fished in intensively and lightly fished areas over the course of 2 months. Within each area, three experimental sites and control sites were surveyed before and after fishing using photoquadrats (n = 240 per 290 m2 site) collected by scuba divers. PERMANOVA analysis indicated no evidence of epibenthic species abundances decreasing due to physical crushing or abrasion from potting on either intensively or lightly fished reefs. A shift in community composition over time was detected but was attributed to natural change as epibenthos in control sites shifted similarly. Experimental pot impacts far exceeded those of the local commercial pot fishery, providing relevant evidence for statutory governing bodies revisiting current fisheries management. Results are applicable across Western Europe due to the selection of habitats with abundant and commonly distributed benthic species. © International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2017.

Simultaneously achieving these multiple goals is difficult due to conflicts between conservation (often long-term) and economic (often short-term) objectives. MPA implementation often includes additional control measures on fisheries (e.g. vessel size restrictions, gear exclusion, catch controls) that in the short-term may have impacts on local fishers' communities. Thus, monitoring fisheries catches before, during and after MPA implementation is essential to document changes in fisheries activities and to evaluate the impact of MPAs in fishers' communities. Remarkably, in contrast with standard fisheries-independent biological surveys, these data are rarely measured at appropriate spatial scales following MPA implementation. Here, the effects of MPA implementation on local fisheries are assessed in a temperate MPA (Arrábida Marine Park, Portugal), using fisheries monitoring methods combining spatial distribution of fishing effort, on-board observations and official landings statistics at scales appropriate to the Marine Park. Fisheries spatial distribution, fishing effort, on-board data collection and official landings registered for the same vessels over time were analysed between 2004 and 2010. The applicability and reliability of using landings statistics alone was tested (i.e. when no sampling data are available) and we conclude that landings data alone only allow the identification of general patterns. The combination of landings information (which is known to be unreliable in many coastal communities) with other methods, provides an effective tool to evaluate fisheries dynamics in response to MPA implementation. As resources for monitoring socio-ecological responses to MPAs are frequently scarce, the use of landings data calibrated with fisheries information (from vessels, gear distribution and on-board data) is a valuable tool applicable to many worldwide coastal small-scale fisheries. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,,Scopus,,Western Waters - non CS,Unspecified,two year,,,Fisheries Dependent Data,on board samplingn landings  ,,,3,Western Waters,non-CS,Marine Protected Area (MPA),Sustainability-Biodiversity protection,Social,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Small-scale,Unspecified,Unspecified,Hooks_Handlines_Longlines_Jigs,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

For this reason, most crews in the North Atlantic area seemed to be organized around a core of agnatic relatives with women playing important shore-based roles. As of the early 1990s, the attention of anthropologists and sociologists shifted away from classical themes such as the social organization of fishing to issues of policy and management, particularly property rights regimes and rights-based fishing. Consequently, the topic of kin and family in the fisheries disappeared into the background. Nonetheless, it would appear that family firms are still predominant in the fisheries. In this paper, I will analyze their logic and dynamic in conditions of ecological, economic and political uncertainty, using ethnographic material from research in Dutch fishing communities on the island of Texel. Considerable attention will be devoted to the issue of what rights-based management regimes have meant for the social organization of and kin involvement in fishing firms. © 2014, van Ginkel; licensee Springer.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,,CS - North Sea,Unspecified,multidecadal,,,,participatory observations and interviews,,,3,North Sea,CS,Social policies ,Unspecified,Social,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,kinship relations within Texel fishing community in relation to family firm ,Unspecified,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

To reassure an environmentally acceptable development, regulatory authorities need to make informed decisions even when evidence and experience are scarce. In this study Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA) has been applied on a wind farm project in Kattegat, proposed within a spawning ground for the Kattegat cod, a threatened population of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.). Six stressors with potential impacts on cod and related to wind farms were investigated. Three of them - extreme noise from pile driving, noise from vessels, and disturbances due to cable-trenching - are related to the construction phase, while lubricant spills and noise from turbines together with electric fields from cables are related to the operation phase. The ecological risk was derived from the combined likelihood and magnitude of potential adverse effects from stressors to the cod population using a weight-of-evidence (WOE) ranking procedure. Available evidence was evaluated based on its reliability, and contradictory arguments were balanced against each other using evidence maps. The option of performing hazardous construction events (e.g. pile-driving) outside biologically sensitive periods was incorporated in the assessment. It was shown that the construction of the wind farm poses a high risk to cod, as defined by the ranked and combined likelihoods and magnitudes of adverse effects. However by avoiding particular construction events during the cod recruitment period ecological risks can be significantly reduced. Specifically for this case, ecological risks are reduced from high to low by avoiding pile-driving from December through June, which confirms previous indications that pile-driving is the most ecologically hazardous activity of offshore wind power development. Additional risk reduction is achieved by avoiding cable trenching from January through May. The study thus illustrates the effectiveness of time-planning for risk reduction. Importantly, the study illustrates how combined ERA and WOE methods can be valuable for handling uncertainties of environmental impacts within offshore industrial development. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",English,Article,,Scopus,,CS - Baltic Sea,Unspecified,Unspecified,,,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey,Ecological Risks Assessment  ,,,3,Baltic Sea,CS,Unspecified,Improved fishery management,Social,Unspecified,Unspecified,REA and assessements criteria,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

However, as with many fisheries regulations, it is difficult to assess whether such a regulation can produce tangible results on population dynamics. In this study, we take advantage of a rare opportunity in which data regarding real-time closures (RTCs) are available for 1990-2014 alongside annual estimates of fishing mortality for three species (Atlantic cod, haddock, and herring) and catch for four species (all plus saithe) in Icelandic fisheries management. We use time series analyses to assess whether RTCs work as expected and yield a lower susceptibility of small fish to being caught, indicated by lower catch levels and selectivities (as estimated from fishing mortalities) in years with more closures. Results indicate that haddock and herring followed this pattern, but only under conditions of generally high fishing mortality. This study represents the first time evidence has been presented that real-time fishery closures can have a beneficial effect on population dynamics, but also suggests that results differ among species. © International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2017.

In light of this challenge, our work addresses the current status of the fishing activity in the north-western region of Portugal, where relevant small-scale fisheries (SSF) are still well established. Based on official statistical data and a stakeholder survey, structural, economic, and social issues that significantly influence the sustainability of this industry were studied. Throughout the 20122019 pre-COVID-19 period, the price revalorization of primary products in first-sale markets was the key aspect that allowed fisheries to partially counteract the loss of economic value associated with the decreased fishing production (a decline of 46% of the total nominal catches). Regarding the regional fishing trade network, the fact that a given species reaches a wide range of prices in closely located major landing ports (Matosinhos, Póvoa de Varzim, and Viana do Castelo) constitutes, nonetheless, an issue that deserves attention and optimization. A survey conducted among training professional fishers confirmed a deeply rooted family/regional tradition but revealed concerns about the future generational replacement. The trainees demanded stronger support from the government, a modernization process for fishing activity, as well as higher social salary standards. Moreover, they assigned a high relevance to the sustainability of aquatic resources. In conclusion, the results shown in the present study reveal a noticeable ability of the regional fishing industry to overcome the challenging economic circumstances that have occurred in the last few years. Against the new scenario decisively influenced by the MSP, a generation of future regional fishers that pursue high social and environmental standards is certainly a solid basis for an optimistic future performance of this activity. For that purpose, a firm commitment to the use of technology seems like a key strategy to adopt in order to further the sustainability of the fisheries in the north-western region of Portugal. © 2022 by the authors.

The marine spatial planning (MSP) framework requires decision makers to analyse spatially explicit environmental and socio-economic data to determine where user conflicts are or might emerge and consider several potential management scenarios. In the present research, a spatially explicit Bayesian belief network (BBN) was applied for this purpose. The BBN was developed to analyse the potential reallocation of artisanal fishing effort to alternative sites due to the introduction of a new, non-take area: an offshore aquaculture site along the Basque continental shelf. The constructed model combined discrete, operational fisheries data, continuous environmental data, and expert judgment to produce fishing activity suitability maps for three different métiers (longlines, nets and traps). The BBN was run with various effort reallocation scenarios for each metier, and the best alternative fishing locations were identified based on environmental suitability, past revenue, and past fishing presence. The closure had a lesser effect on net and longline activity, displacing 10% and 7% of local fishing effort respectively. Comparatively, 50% of all local effort by traps took place within the closed grounds, and few alternative sites were identified. Nets were found to have the greatest number of alternative fishing grounds surrounding the aquaculture site. The present research demonstrates how BBNs can support spatially explicit scenario building and user-user conflict analysis for sustainable and successful ecosystem-based marine spatial planning. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,,Scopus,,Western Waters - non CS,Unspecified,Unspecified,,decade,,GIS,3,,2,Western Waters,non-CS,Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP),"Conflict avoidance (Economic, Social, Environmental)",Social,Unspecified,Unspecified,Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN),Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Spatial analysis,Netters_Longlines_Traps,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Based on the data of 71 fishing vessels, which constitute the entire fleet of Norwegian seagoing purse seiners, an ordinal least squares model is applied by including the vessel's catch capacity, quota holding, and return on invested capital (ROIC) along with several control variables. The estimated results suggest that the key factor affecting ROIC is overcapacity. Specifically, when the relative ratio of capacity and quota holding increases by 1%, a vessel's ROIC decreases by 0.692%.

When assessing the ecological, economic, and social-cultural impacts of protection, the dynamics of fisheries and fishers reallocation within and around multiple-use MPAs should be analyzed. Despite this, few studies incorporate the baseline information of fisheries distribution, therefore compromising an understanding of fishers' preferences, choices and constrains before losing fishing grounds through the establishment of zoning and protection measures. To fulfil this gap, here we assess the spatial and seasonal fishers' preferences from local artisanal fisheries (nets, traps, jigs and longlines) before the implementation of a MPA management plan (the Arrábida Marine Park, Portugal). Zero inflated modelling, hotspot analysis, vessels distribution range and site fidelity statistics showed that the main drivers of fishing effort allocation are the placement of preferred fishing grounds which are likely related to the distribution of target species and associated habitats. Proximity to port, weather conditions and distance to coast are also important factors influencing, in different ways, these artisanal fisheries. Our findings highlight the complex dynamics of the distribution of artisanal fisheries operating multiple-gears and targeting multiple-species and are likely transferable to many coastal multiple-use MPAs where no baseline data exist. Moreover, the variety of responses and preferences found between gears and fishers before the establishment of zoning are important to understand the dynamics of local fisheries, to contribute to an ecosystem-based management and to improve both conservation and fisheries management decisions. Our study is one of the few characterizing fisheries dynamics and fishers' preferences before protection measures are implemented providing important lessons to the management of coastal fisheries where artisanal fisheries prevail. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,,Scopus,,Western Waters - non CS,Unspecified,Unspecified,,year,Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey,,2,,2,Western Waters,non-CS,Environmental measures and Habitats protection policies,Improved fishery management,Social,Unspecified,Unspecified,spatiotemporal distribution of fishing effort ,Unspecified,Small-scale,Unspecified, Spatial analysis,Unspecified,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In this scenario, scholars agree that adaptation to climate change requires that fisheries increase their social, institutional, and ecological resilience. The resilience or capacity of a fishery to be maintained without shifting to a different state (e.g., collapse) is at stake under climate change impacts and overexploitation. Despite this urgent need, applying the resilience concept in a spatially explicit and quantitative manner to inform policy remains unexplored. We take a resilience approach and operationalize the concept in industrial fisheries for two species that have been observed to significantly shift distribution in European waters: hake (Merluccius merluccius) and cod (Gadus morhua), in the context of the European Union institutional settings. With a set of resilience factors from the literature and by means of contemporary and historic data, we select indicators that are combined into an index that measures resilience on the ecologic, socioeconomic, and institutional dimensions of the fishery. We find that the resilience index varies among species and countries, with lower resilience levels in the socioeconomic dimension of the fisheries. We also see that resilience largely depends on the overexploitation status of the fishery. The results highlight the need to address social and institutional settings to enhance fisheries adaptation to climate change and allow to inform on climate resilient adaptation pathways for the fisheries. © 2021, The Author(s).",English,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,,,Unspecified,Unspecified,,,,littérature review about resiliance and vulnerability ,3,,3,Unspecified,non-CS,Unspecified,Unspecified,Social,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

A sharp decrease in the beam trawl catch observed since 2015 has raised concern about not only socio-economic issues but also ecological issues and the effect that beam trawl fisheries have had on exploited stocks. Besides the effect that beam trawl fisheries can have on targeted economically important species, intensive dredging can cause long-term changes in the benthic community. Therefore, this study aimed to detect the effect that this type of fishing gear has on target and by-catch species. Furthermore, survey data were compared with the official beam trawl fishery data gathered through Vessel Monitoring System data together with fishermens logbooks. Our research targeted two adjacent areas: an area where beam trawl fishing is allowed and an area where it is forbidden. The results demonstrate that the commercially important catch represented a minor share of the total beam trawl catch in both survey areas, while discard made up more than 93% of the total catch. The main beam trawl commercially important species in the Croatian part of the northern Adriatic Sea was Pecten jacobaeus, followed by Solea solea and Ostrea edulis. Our results suggest that beam trawl fisheries mostly affect target bivalve species and some non-commercial benthic species (e.g. sponges). The differences recorded between areas could suggest that beam trawl fisheries cause changes mostly in the P. jacobaeus population. © 2021",English,Article,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,,CS - Mediterranean,Unspecified,Unspecified,,year,Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey,VMS and fishers logbook data were used (provided by the directorate of Fisheries of the Croatian Ministry of Agriculture from January to December 2019.  ,,,2,Mediterranean,CS,Unspecified,Improved fishery management,Social,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The path to the ITQ system in Iceland started in 1979 in some pelagic fisheries. A substantial step was made in demersal fisheries when moving toward an individual vessel quota (IVQ) system in 1984. The biggest milestone in management was reached in 1990 when a comprehensive ITQ system was introduced that covered most Icelandic fisheries. Overfishing was a problem in the early days of the ITQ system. The path to sustainable fisheries was long and gradual, and now, most fish stocks are sustainably managed. There is clear evidence that the current fishing rights holders in Icelandic fisheries have demonstrated environmental stewardship because they have not opposed reductions in the total allowable catch (TAC) of important species. The economic performance of the industry has improved, and both the fishing and processing parts of Iceland's fisheries are now very profitable, and the fishing component is paying significant resource rent taxes. The industry has changed considerably, fishing rights have been consolidated, primary fish markets have been liberalized, and vertically integrated firms dominate the Icelandic fishing industry. Fishing rights (permanent quota shares) are very valuable, so entering the industry for new participants is difficult. The Icelandic ITQ system is now and has always been very controversial and under heavy political debate and scrutiny. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,,Scopus,,NE-Atlantic,Unspecified,year,,,,,,,,NE-Atlantic,non-CS,Allocation of rights,Species protection-Discard reduction,Social,Positive,Country level,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Landings (value),Unspecified,Unspecified,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

We tested Productivity Susceptibility Analysis (PSA) to assess the potential vulnerability of the marine fish community in the Skagerrak-Kattegat (Eastern North Sea) to possible interactions with all Swedish fisheries operating in the area. This analysis combines attributes for a species productivity with attributes related to the susceptibility to capture to quantify a single score for vulnerability: high, medium, or low risk. Results indicate that demersal trawl and gillnet fisheries were associated with the highest risk levels if interaction occurs, i.e. having the highest prevalence of species with potentially high vulnerability to the fisheries. Mixed results were seen when comparing the assessment results with available data. The main benefit of utilizing PSA in the area is the comprehensiveness of the assessment, including data-deficient fisheries and species. Drawbacks include potential overestimation of actual risks.

The biological submodel was parameterized with age-structured population parameters for the five target stocks in the WM MAP (European hake, red mullet, deep-water rose shrimp, Nephrops and red shrimp) with a sixth stock combining the remaining commercial by catch and following a biomass dynamics model. The trawl fleet was composed of three fleet segments, according to Vessel Length class (VL1218, VL1824, VL2440), practicing two métiers: coastal mixed demersal fishery and deep-water crustacean fishery. The technological solutions analyzed are two simple technical modifications to the otter bottom trawl and based on i) using a panel of meshes turned 90° (T90) in the extension of the trawl net, and ii) inserting a selective grid built from 40 mm square mesh (SM40) netting into the extension of the trawl net. The Results show that, in terms of policy objectives, the reduction in the values of fishing mortality achieved with these selectivity modifications would be insufficient to reach the target fishing mortality at maximum sustainable yield (Fmsy) prescribed in the WM MAP by 2025. However, model results project a substantial recovery of hake and red mullet stock biomass. The recovery of these two important stocks would help improve the evolution of the economic indicators, resulting generally in higher income, profits and salaries in the short (2025) and mid term (2030). © 2021",English,Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,,Mediterranean - non CS,">100,000",decade,">100,000",year,Fisheries Dependent Data,bioeconomic management strategy evaluation (MSE),2,2,3,Mediterranean,non-CS,Catch limit,Stock recovery,Social,Positive,Country level,"Bioeconomic modelling (BEMCOM, BEMTOOL, FLBEIA, MEFISTO, FISHRENT, Impact Assessment Models (IAMS), SMART, EFIMAS)",Unspecified,Large-scale,Labor cost _ Profit (gross) _ costs (total) _ Gross Operating Surplus (GOS) _ Value Added (gross),Unspecified,Trawl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

For the purpose of an environmental risk assessment (ERA) in an impacted estuary in SW Europe (the Sado, Portugal), juvenile Solea senegalensis from commercial fishing areas were surveyed for histopathological liver alterations and biochemical biomarkers. Although the findings revealed moderate differences in the patterns of histopathological traits between urban/industrial- and agricultural-influenced areas within the same estuary, no significant distinction was found between the cumulative alterations in animals from the two sites. The overall level of histopathological injury was low and severe traits like neoplasms or pre-neoplastic foci were absent. While metallothionein induction and lipid peroxidation could relate to histopathological condition indices, the activity of anti-oxidant enzymes appeared to be impaired in animals collected off the estuary's heavy-industry belt (the most contaminated site), which may partially explain some degree of hepatic integrity loss. Overall, the results are consistent with low-moderate contamination of the estuary and indicate that oxidative stress is the most important factor accounting for differences between sites.

However, information on gear selectivity and discards has been studied separately so far. In this paper, the overall size-selection pattern by the trawl codend in the sea and by the fisher onboard the vessel is investigated for four commercially important fish species, Mullus barbatus, Mullus surmuletus, Pagellus erythrinus and Lophius budegassa, using different codends. For each species, the selection model used offered the possibility to simultaneously describe the escape, discard, and landing probability. The results, useful for fisheries management, showed that the codend made of 40 mm diamond meshes was always detrimental for the stocks. The 40 mm square meshes codend compared to that of 50 mm diamond meshes was more appropriate for the sustainability of both Mullus species, providing also a lawful catch along with greater compliance to the rules fisher behaviour, negligible discards and the lowest possible economic losses for the fisher. None of the codends was effective for P. erythrinus in achieving the minimum conservation reference size (MCRS) of the species. All codends were harmful to L. budegassa as the majority of juveniles were retained in the codend, resulting in negligible escapees, a high discard probability, and landings of a size much lower than the length at first maturity of the species. Further studies are needed to be conducted in the future for other species, since the trawl fishery in the Mediterranean is a multi-species fishery. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,,Scopus,,CS - Mediterranean,">100,000",Less than two months,">100,000",two month,Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey,maximum log-likelihood function,2,2,3,Mediterranean,CS,Discard ban Policy,Stock recovery,Social,Negative,Country level,Logit _ Probit _ Gombertz _ Richard,Unspecified,Large-scale,Escape probability _ Discards _ Landing probability,Economic Performance,Trawl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

The components of effort allocation decisions are further complicated by changes in the market conditions and the constant movements of fish between spawning and feeding habitats. Migratory behavior influences the dispersal of species, relative availability of fish and its composition, and the bycatch likelihood across different locations over the course of a fishing year. The objective of this article is to investigate the optimal allocation of fishing effort in the Norwegian bottom-trawl fleet within economically important species; cod, saithe, and haddock across three heavily trawled areas-including southern and northern parts of the west coast of Norway, and the high sea areas of the Arctic-to achieve maximum expected economic return, with respect to the individual vessel quota constraints and bycatch considerations. The results from a mixed integer non-linear optimization problem evidence that the spawning migration of Northeast Arctic cod along the northwest coast, effort allocation behavior of coastal fleet, together with institutional regulations necessitate the substitution of fishing effort across different fishing locations within the fishing season to maximize expected return. The results of our study further reveal that the Arctic region to target cod is the biggest contributor to annual fishing revenue.

Although fishing effort distribution and marine habitat distribution and use are increasingly well understood, little research has quantified spatio-temporal changes in fishing effort or investigated drivers of these changes. Here, a holistic approach was taken to investigate socio-economic, environmental and technological drivers of change in fishing effort distribution of the Northumberland pot-fishery (20042014) using Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) analyses. BBNs were populated using large-scale high resolution spatial and temporal fisheries monitoring data, quantitative and qualitative interviews with fishers and expert opinion. Increases in fishing effort over time were explained by a combination of changes in fleet composition and fishers behaviour. Increasing vessel and engine sizes, combined with an increased uptake of improved fishing technology have resulted in a greater ability for vessels to fish a greater number of pots. This increase in vessel and fishing capability has resulted in fishers increased ability to fish in harsher weather conditions, as well as target specific areas or habitats quickly and opportunistically. Non-technological factors, such as declines in stocks of finfish and nephrops and the increasing operational costs of participating in these fisheries may have resulted in fishers solely fishing in the less regulated pot-fishery, targeting high value European lobster on a full-time basis. Increasing costs of pot-fishing in Northumberland coupled with stagnating crab and lobster landings prices may have resulted in increased fishing effort to maintain profitability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,,CS - North Sea,"10,000-50,000",decade,"500-1,000",quarter,Fisheries Dependent Data,Bayesian Belief Network,2,2,3,North Sea,CS,Effort Control,Sustainability-Biodiversity protection,Social,Positive,Region level,Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN),Unspecified,Small-scale,Fishing Effort (days at sea),Adaptive Capacity,Pots,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This study assesses the benefit of closing a coastal area (an essential habitat for European hake recruits) to fishing, in addition to other alternatives of spatial management, compared with traditional, nonspatial management scenarios on fishing grounds exploited by the bottom trawl fleets of Blanes and Palamós (Province of Girona, NE Spain). We use InVEST, a spatially explicit model of intermediate complexity that simulates the bioeconomic effects of management measures for decision making. The sensitivity analysis of the model results shows the high influence of some parameters, particularly the parameterization of the recruitment submodel and European hakes fecundity coefficients. The results are also examined in the light of uncertainty on migration parameters: in the two cases analysed (considering migration patterns or not), the results of the indicators (catch and revenues, abundance, recruitment and spawning stock biomass) were qualitatively similar and all show that the application of a restricted fishing area in one particular fishing ground (Vol de Terra) is the best management alternative. Its bioeconomic effects are comparable to a reduction of fishing effort of up to 20%. With high levels of ontogenetic migration, fishing on a second fishing ground (Cul de Rec  El Pas) should be restricted to enhance the biomass of the European hake population. © 2018 CSIC.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,,CS - Mediterranean,">100,000",decade,"10,000-50,000",year,Simulated dynamics,Age structured spatial model,2,2,3,Mediterranean,CS,Marine Protected Area (MPA),Species protection-Discard reduction,Social,Positive,Region level,InVEST model,Unspecified,Large-scale,Landings (value),Resilience,Trawl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

In 2003, a sampling programme addressing Iberian hake discards by the Portuguese fleets was implemented according to the requirements of the European Commission Data Collection Regulation (Reg. EC No 1543/2000). A preliminary analysis of the data collected showed trip and haul duration to be potential sources of bias, because their relationship to discards per unit effort (DPUE) was not linear. This paper develops estimators for discards by weight using fishing effort as auxiliary information, describes a jack-knife procedure to identify influential observations, applies the methodologies to Iberian hake as a case study and compares the results obtained by each estimator. The estimators tested are based on Cochran's estimator of the total (Cochran, 1977). Four estimators are compared, each one consisting of a combination of (i) weighting or not weighting the observations by fishing effort and (ii) post-stratifying or not post-stratifying the trips by duration in days-at-sea. A jack-knife analysis of observations' influence on the final estimate is performed by year and fleet. The results indicate that the estimator that uses both a weighted DPUE and post-stratification by the trip duration performs best and is the most robust to influential observations. The estimates of hake discards increase with time, while a stable but oscillating pattern is observed in the demersal fleet. Total hake discards show a fluctuating trend until 2009 and a large drop in 2010. The minimum discard estimates after removing influential observations was 795. t in 2006 and the maximum was 1956. t in 2009, with coefficients of variation (CV) between 22% and 74%. Estimates using the full data set were higher but had lower CVs. The observed trend in discards agrees with the recruitment estimates by the Portuguese International Bottom Trawl Survey. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,,Scopus,,NE-Atlantic,">100,000",decade,">100,000",year,Fisheries Dependent Data,Descriptive data analysis,2,2,3,NE-Atlantic,non-CS,Fleet efficiency policies,Fleet Efficiency ,Social,Negative,Region level,Exploratory data analysis,Unspecified,Large-scale,Costs (variable),Economic Performance,Various,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Using two North Sea prohibited trawling areas (PTAs) established > 80 years ago, social (fishers' perceptions), management (fishing effort and compliance) and ecological (fish abundance and size) data were combined to assess the PTAs against their primary societal (conflict resolution) and secondary ecological (stock protection) objectives. Fishers perceived that the PTAs resolved conflicts between static and mobile gear sectors, despite evidence of non-compliance. However, few fishers perceived that they personally benefited from the PTAs. Fish abundance and size data from baited traps (BT) and video (BV) provided no evidence of PTA effects, but trawling effort was a significant predictor of BT fish abundance data and improved the model of BV fish abundance data. The absence of PTA effects on fish is attributable to non-compliance, the high mobility of the fish involved and their continued exploitation within the PTAs using static gear. This points to the need for greater understanding of the behaviour of fishers in relation to closures. The study also highlights the challenges of quantifying possible fishery benefits of small temperate closed areas and questions whether widely advocated fishery benefits may have enhanced initial support, but failure to deliver them may erode faith in such closures as a fisheries management tool. © Copyright Foundation for Environmental Conservation 2012.",English,Article,,Scopus,,CS - North Sea,"10,000-50,000",year,"10,000-50,000",year,Simulated dynamics,semi structured interviews & VMS,2,2,3,North Sea,CS,Marine Protected Area (MPA),"Conflict avoidance (Economic, Social, Environmental)",Social,Neutral,Individual,Generalized Linear Models,Unspecified,Small-scale,Fishing Effort (days at sea),Compliance,Trawl_Passive gears,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

However, it may not be feasible to achieve MSY simultaneously for multiple species because of trade-offs that result from interactions between species, mixed fisheries and the multiple objectives of stakeholders. The premise in this study is that MSY is a concept that needs adaptation, not wholesale replacement. The approach chosen to identify trade-offs and stakeholder preferences involved a process of consulting and discussing options with stakeholders as well as scenario modelling with bio-economic and multi-species models. It is difficult to intuitively anticipate the consequences of complex trade-offs and it is also complicated to address them from a political point of view. However, scenario modelling showed that the current approach of treating each stock separately and ignoring trade-offs may result in unacceptable ecosystem, economic or social effects in North Sea fisheries. Setting FMSY as a management target without any flexibility for compromises may lead to disappointment for some of the stakeholders. To treat FMSY no longer as a point estimate but rather as a ""Pretty Good Yield"" within sustainable ranges was seen as a promising way forward to avoid unacceptable outcomes when trying to fish all stocks simultaneously at FMSY. This study gives insights on how inclusive governance can help to reach consensus in difficult political processes, and how science can be used to make informed decisions inside a multi-dimensional trade-off space. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,,CS - North Sea,">100,000",multidecadal,"10,000-50,000",year,Simulated dynamics,"recording stakeholder preferences, and scenario modelling of preferred options",2,2,3,North Sea,CS,Total Allowable Catch (TAC),Stock recovery,Social,Positive,Region level,"Bioeconomic modelling (BEMCOM, BEMTOOL, FLBEIA, MEFISTO, FISHRENT, Impact Assessment Models (IAMS), SMART, EFIMAS)",Unspecified,Unspecified,Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) _ Landings (volume),Sustainability-Resilience,Various,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

It also adopts a holistic approach to fisheries management, considering all factors driving fishers' behavior, and ultimately, the long-term maintenance of living resources. The most reliable way to pursue these aims could be represented by a change in the exploitation pattern, in order to guarantee the sustainability of fisheries without compromising their socioeconomic viability. In this paper, the demersal fisheries of the Ionian Sea [Geographic Sub-area (GSA) 19] were analyzed with respect to their spatial, temporal, economic, and biological characteristics in terms of four key species for fisheries, namely European hake, red mullet, giant red shrimp, and deep-water rose shrimp. Specifically, (1) a quantitative procedure was applied to break down the whole system (including small-scale fleet components) into a series of fishing grounds using input data about fishing efforts; (2) the different fleet segments were defined as a combination of main gear and fishing grounds; (3) the effort and production by fleet segment were derived according to biological samplings of commercial data (Data Collection Framework for the collection and management of fisheries data, DCF), information on localization of nursery and spawning grounds, and expert knowledge; and (4) all this information was used to feed a bioeconomic modeling tool (BEMTOOL), and to explore alternative exploitation patterns. A series of scenarios including the status quo were defined, starting from the actual management approach based on temporal fishing closure. The results showed that significant improvements in the exploitation pattern could be achieved by setting up spatial and/or temporal gear-specific bans of the fishing activity. More specifically, scenarios based on a 3-month fishing ban for trawlers are expected to provide high rebuilding of the spawning stock biomass (SSB) for all target stocks, and at the same time, result in a remarkable reduction of discards. When combined with a seasonal fishing ban for small-scale fleets equipped with nets and longlines, this approach could lead to a significant improvement in all indicators, but especially the SSB of the exploited species. © 2017 Russo, Bitetto, Carbonara, Carlucci, D'Andrea, Facchini, Lembo, Maiorano, Sion, Spedicato, Tursi and Cataudella.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,,CS - Mediterranean,">100,000",five year,"10,000-50,000",year,Simulated dynamics,,2,2,3,Mediterranean,CS,Seasonal closure,Stock recovery,Social,Positive,Country level,"Bioeconomic modelling (BEMCOM, BEMTOOL, FLBEIA, MEFISTO, FISHRENT, Impact Assessment Models (IAMS), SMART, EFIMAS)",Unspecified,Unspecified,Landings (volume) _ Fishing Effort (days at sea) _ Discards _Revenues (total) _ Spawning stock biomass (SSB),Sustainability-Resilience_Spatial habitat data,Trawl_Passive gears,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

In the EU this is seen in landing obligations in the new Common Fisheries Policy. The European fisheries are thus under pressure to be highly selective both in adjusting catches to the individual or collective quota combinations and to be size selective in order to optimise the economic outcome of the available quota. This paper proposes a strategy of time-place selectivity by sharing real-time data and information between vessels about areas with high abundance of unwanted species and sizes (hotspots). The paper examines use of time-place regulation, risks_benefits of sharing knowledge and experiences from a previous real-time information sharing system as basis for developing the four models for fisher's sharing of information. The models differ with regard to data and information collection methods, who owns and access the data and hotspot warnings. The models are tested through a discussion of the possible application of the models in the context of the nephrops trawl fishery in Kattegat and Skagerrak. Based on this the models are proposed as possible tools for the fishing industry and managers when adjusted to specific local conditions, and a recommendation for policy support of development of information sharing systems is outlined. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",English,Article,,Scopus,,North Sea - non CS,">100,000",Unspecified,">100,000",,,,,,,North Sea,non-CS,Discard ban Policy,Species protection-Discard reduction,Social,Positive,Individual,Lit Review - Questionnaires - Surveys,Unspecified,Large-scale,Catch (volume)_Catch (size),Unspecified,Trawl,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Driven by overarching global and European policies and national legislations, current systematic conservation planning in the UK and France requires an ecosystem approach that takes into account not only nature but also the human activities that take place in an area. Here, we identified a set of 64 socioeconomic variables potentially relevant for marine and coastal stakeholders in a European context and a comprehensive set of 20 marine and coastal stakeholder categories. Ninety national organisations in the UK and France belonging to those categories and potentially affected by/interested in the designation of multiple-use MPAs were identified and surveyed. Results show that environmental NGOs, research centres, local councils, managing agencies and statutory nature conservation bodies perceived that they are positively affected by these MPAs, whereas fishers' organisations, shipping and aggregate industrial organisations and recreational organisations perceived to be chiefly negatively affected by MPAs. On average, the ecological effects of multiple-use MPAs are perceived as 'largely positive', though 30% of respondents did not perceive any positive ecological effects from these MPAs. The social, economic and cultural effects of such MPAs are perceived as 'moderately positive'. Most respondents perceived broad range (>10. km) and permanent ecological, social, economic and cultural effects from multiple-use MPA designation suggesting high societal expectations towards these areas. However, only five variables were perceived to vary in intensity after the designation of multiple-use MPAs: 'research', 'environmental performance by citizens, businesses and towns', 'number of green businesses', 'tourism' and 'economic activities'. The most important 'social' variables for stakeholder organisations referred to local populations' engagement with the MPA, tourism and research. The most important 'economic' variables were linked to fishing, shipping and aquaculture activities. These variables highlight relevant topics to be considered in MPA planning, designation and management processes, especially in the UK and France. There were statistically significant differences in the ratings of socioeconomic variables between many organisations belonging to the same intuitive stakeholder categories, suggesting the importance of including as wide a range of stakeholder organisations as feasible in MPA socioeconomic-related processes. Our methods and findings can help to inform and streamline ongoing and future participatory MPA planning, management and monitoring processes in Europe and in other regions with similar socioeconomic characteristics. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",English,Article,,Scopus,,Western Waters - non CS,">100,000",Unspecified,">100,000",,,,,,,Western Waters,non-CS,Marine Protected Area (MPA),Unspecified,Social,Unspecified,Unspecified,Lit Review - Questionnaires - Surveys,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The function of such an optimization strategy is to maximize the usability of the sea surface. This article focuses on the pragmatic aspects of marine spatial planning. The authors presuppose a tool for planners that (i) is based on readily available information, is comparable for various countries (ii) and for which the economic interpretation is straightforward and allows for the comparison of fisheries with other sectors. The analysis is based on two pan-European surveys collected under the Common Fisheries Policy. The distribution and catch information is sourced from the Vessel Monitoring System and logbooks, and the economic data come from the national data submissions for the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries. A contribution margin consisting of the difference between the revenue and variable costs at a spatial unit with a 0.05-degree resolution was chosen as the most appropriate indicator for these purposes. A variable costing method can be used to determine the efficiency of maritime sectors in specific spatial units without artificially assigning costs that are unrelated to a given sea area. The analysis covers the period of 20132017. Three key areas for Polish fisheries have been identified: the Gulf of Gdansk, the Bornholm Basin, and the S?upsk Furrow; the average contribution margins in these regions were 1133, 651 and 580 EUR/km2, respectively. The variance analysis revealed that the high indicator values were mostly influenced by high catches of sprat and herring fished with pelagic trawls as well as high sprat prices. Fishing with passive gear (gillnets, hooks) and in the 3rd and 4th quarters proved to result in deficits in a large Polish maritime area. The indicators may have been influenced by the lack of data on the individual steaming times, as well as by variations among fuel consumptions and salary costs within fleet segments. Despite these limitations, the method used in this study allows a first attempt at the estimation of the contribution margin and its spatial variation over time in the context of Maritime Spatial Planning needs. The calculation undertaken in this paper yields the monetary interpretation of private spatial rents and future comparisons among various maritime sectors and various countries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,,Scopus,,CS - Baltic Sea,">100,000",Unspecified,">100,000",,,,,,,Baltic Sea,CS,Unspecified,Fleet Efficiency ,Social,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Large-scale,Revenues (total)_Costs (variable),Unspecified,Driftnets_ Seine _ Trawl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

However, the way to operationalize this approach remains challenging. The present paper illustrates how the concepts of stochastic co-viability, which accounts for dynamic complexities, uncertainties, risk and sustainability constraints, can be useful for the implementation of EBFM. In the present case, this concept is used to identify fishing strategies that satisfy both ecological conservation and economic sustainability in a multi-species, multi-fleet context. Economic Viability Analysis (EVA) and the broader Co-Viability Analysis (CVA), are proposed to expand the usual Population Viability Analysis (PVA) and precautionary approach. An illustration is proposed, using data on the fisheries of Bay of Biscay (France) exploiting the stocks of nephrops and hake. Stochastic simulations show how CVA can guarantee both ecological (stock) and economic (profit) sustainability. Using 2008 as a baseline, the model is used to identify fishing efforts that ensure such co-viability. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,,CS - Western Waters,">100,000",decade,">100,000",year,,,,,,Western Waters,CS,Fleet efficiency policies,Species protection-Discard reduction,Social,Unspecified,Unspecified,Population Viability Analysis _ Economic Viability Approach _ Co-Viability Approach,Unspecified,Large-scale,Unspecified,Stock Protection_Economic viability_co-viability,Gillnets _ Trawl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

The Participatory Action Research method is used here as a pilot experience to gather reactions from fishers, scientists and fisheries managers to the Western Mediterranean Multi-Annual Demersal Fisheries Plan (WM MAP) by identifying needs and concerns, but also alternatives to maintain the viability of the fishery. The data gathering process consisted on a structured questionnaire administered during a workshop to 40 stakeholders involved in Spanish fisheries in the Mediterranean, followed by an open discussion session. The results show that fishers disagree with the new regulations, which they perceive as yet another layer of restrictive regulations for an industry that faces major challenges and currently has low profitability, whereas scientists tended to agree more with the WM MAP than the administration or the fishers. Nevertheless, all stakeholders agree that the values of the cultural heritage of fisheries and the exploration of alternative marketing systems should balance the productivity-based approach to fisheries policies followed so far, that have shown signs of failure. According to stakeholder perceptions, this would improve the economic and social viability of fisheries, as well as highlight the value of fishing activity and its social prestige. Integrating the value of cultural heritage and post-production processes into the CFP would improve stakeholder involvement in fisheries policies. Through participatory research methods the ecosystem-based management approach could be embedded in a community-based approach, integrating its social actors in a proactive attitude and considering fisheries as a human activity socially and culturally rooted in the environment, which would enhance the effective implementation of fisheries policies. © 2021 The Authors",English,Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,,CS - Mediterranean,Unspecified,Unspecified,,,,,,,,Mediterranean,CS,Unspecified,Unspecified,Social,Unspecified,Unspecified,Lit Review - Questionnaires - Surveys,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

According to the results, it was concluded that the efficiency of pelagic trawl fisheries could be increased due to the improvements in the existing structural conditions and the revisions to be made in the policies implemented and the subsidies provided. However, the factors affecting inefficiency seem to be influenced by internal factors such as experience in pelagic trawling, the total crew, and the most critical issue to eliminate inefficiency seems to be increasing the subsidy rate in pelagic trawlers. In this study, it was found that the effects of engine power, total length, fuel consumption and active fishing day reduce the effect of fish catching pressure to a low level. However, other factors affecting this pressure were also included in the model. Especially when it was considered that the use of credit did not affect the efficiency, it was revealed that the increase in the subsidy rates rather than the fuel subsidy would make the trawlers more efficient. © 2021",English,Article,,Scopus,,Black Sea,Unspecified,Unspecified,,,,,,,,Black Sea,non-CS,Unspecified,Unspecified,Social,Unspecified,Unspecified,Stochastic Analysis,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Trawl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

The need for assessing the effectiveness of the MPA in the future, led MAVA Foundation to fund a knowledge survey project aiming to serve as a baseline for future reference. A series of experimental fishing surveys took place with static nets, the outcomes of which are presented herein. From June 2018 to September 2020, a series of 8 fishing excursions with a total of 40 experimental fishing sets with bottom static nets were realized in 5 set locations around Gyaros island, inside the MPA protection zone. A total of 75 species were identified; the most abundant species, in terms of biomass, being: Parrotfish-Sparisoma cretense, red scorpionfish-Scorpaena scrofa, common spiny lobster- Palinurus elephas, red porgy-Pagrus pagrus, little tunny-Euthynnus alletteratus, Mediterranean moray-Muraena helena, lesser spotted dogfish -Scyliorhinus canicula, forkbeard-Phycis phycis, surmullet-Mullus surmuletus, common cuttlefish-Sepia officinalis and common Pandora-Pagellus erythrinus. A comparison with similar data in adjacent areas outside the MPA allowed for assessing the effectiveness of the MPA based on four indicators: Species diversity index, species relative biomass index, key predator species abundance, and alien fish abundance. Based solely on the experimental fishing trials, the MPA seems to be functioning, since both species diversity and abundance were higher within the protected area. However, its performance may still not be considered as optimal, as this is indicated by the large proportion of undersized key predators (e.g. groupers), although more abundant and larger than the ones residing outside the MPA. © 2022 Damalas et al.

Strategic goals are addressed via general and operational management objectives. To add credibility and legitimacy to the development of objectives, for this study stakeholders explored intermediate level ecological, economic and social management objectives for Northeast Atlantic pelagic ecosystems. Stakeholder workshops were undertaken with participants being free to identify objectives based on their own insights and needs. Overall 26 objectives were proposed, with 58% agreement in proposed objectives between two workshops. Based on published evidence for pressure-state links, examples of operational objectives and suitable indicators for each of the 26 objectives were then selected. It is argued that given the strong species-specific links of pelagic species with the environment and the large geographic scale of their life cycles, which contrast to demersal systems, pelagic indicators are needed at the level of species (or stocks) independent of legislative region. Pelagic community indicators may be set at regional scale in some cases. In the evidence-based approach used in this study, the selection of species or region specific operational objectives and indicators was based on demonstrated pressure-state links. Hence observed changes in indicators can reliably inform on appropriate management measures. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,,CS - Western Waters,Unspecified,Unspecified,,,,,,,,Western Waters,CS,Unspecified,Species protection-Discard reduction,Social,Unspecified,Unspecified,Lit Review - Questionnaires - Surveys,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

This paper describes the governance process and analyses the governance mechanisms and conflicts surrounding ongoing fisheries management planning with a focus on two Natura 2000 sites in the Danish part of the Skagerrak Sea designated to protect harbour porpoises. Responsibility for developing fisheries management for Natura 2000 sites is solely the remit of the fisheries agency, including mechanisms related to stakeholder involvement. This approach fuels the efficiency of the decision making process, while full transparency and/or co-decision becomes less of a given within a ministry for an. economic sector compared with the environment ministry. In relation to porpoises, conflicts are driven mainly by the economy and the varying perceptions of the bycatch issue, with great differences between government, NGO's and fishers. Interviews with fishers and fishing effort data reveal intra-sectoral conflicts pertaining to the incompatibility of active trawling and passive gillnetting in the areas. The paper questions the overall approach to managing the harbour porpoise bycatch issue in light of Natura 2000 and discusses the role of science and its high level of influence in this planning process.

In Norway, the Northeast Atlantic (NEA) cod (Gadus morhua) fishing industry represents the most important economic single species fishery and the gillnet fishery accounts for 24% of the national total allowable catch (TAC) of NEA cod. Despite the importance of the gillnet fishery in Norway, significant amounts of gillnets are lost at sea each year. As gillnets are made of synthetic materials (i.e. nylon) with high breaking strength and durability, lost, abandoned and_or discarded fishing gear (LADFG) continues catching target and non-target species for years. This phenomenon, known as ""ghost fishing"", cause negative impact on the benthic marine environment and to the fisheries management. Over the last years, the development of biodegradable gillnets to replace traditional nylon gillnets has become particularly sought after in fisheries worldwide. However, biodegradable gillnets are less efficient and more expensive than traditional nylon gillnets. As the urgency to eliminate the negative environmental impacts of LADFG increases, a crucial question remains how to successfully implement biodegradable gillnets to replace the more efficient nylon gillnets currently used in commercial fisheries. In this article we investigate how central elements of fisheries management may be used to implement biodegradable gillnets and how this may challenge the current resource allocation policy among different gear- and vessel groups. © 2020 The Authors",English,Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,,CS - North Sea,">100,000",Unspecified,,,,,,,,North Sea,CS,Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ),Health,Social,Unspecified,Region level,Unspecified,Unspecified,Small-scale,Costs (total) _ Discards,Unspecified,Gillnets,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

However, scientific documentation of the selectivity characteristics of Danish seines is lacking, and the gear generally is grouped with bottom trawls and Scottish seines in fisheries management legislation. In this study, we developed a codend cover to estimate the selectivity of a standard commercial Danish seine codend for four fish species. The data for the dominant species, dab (Limanda limanda) and plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), was best described by models that combine two or three logistic models, which indicated that more than one selection process was at work. Selectivity of cod (Gadus morhua) was best described by a Richard curve and selectivity of red gurnard (Chelidonichthys lucernus) by a logistic curve. The estimated selectivity curve of dab indicated, contrary to cod and plaice, low retention of individuals below MLS. Confidence limits for larger length classes of cod and red gurnard were relatively wide. For plaice, the estimated selection factor, which is the length with 50% retention divided by mesh size, was comparable to literature values from trawl studies. The average value for cod was similar for Danish and Scottish seines, but lower for trawls. The results are discussed in the context of fisheries management with focus on the landing obligation of the new Common Fisheries Policy. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,,North Sea - non CS,"10,000-50,000",year,"1,000-5,000",year,,,,,,North Sea,non-CS,Unspecified,Unspecified,Social,Unspecified,Unspecified,SELNET,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Selectivity,Seine,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

The main aim of our investigationwas to describe the prevalence of discarding and its evolution over the past 70 years using information gathered through individual questionnaire-based interviews with fishers from ports in Spain, Italy, and Greece, following a standardized sampling protocol. Although it proved impossible to derive absolute estimates of the volume of discarded catches over the period investigated, we conclude that over the past 70 years, discarding as a practice has gradually increased in the northern Mediterranean trawl fisheries and has been accompanied by a shift in the species composition of the discarded catch. While discarding can occur for a number of reasons, our investigations indicate that discarding in the past was mostly driven by market demand, but recent legal and regulatory constraints have led to changes in fishing strategies and became a significant reason for discards. © 2015 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

The extent and intensity of bottom trawling on the European continental shelf (0-1000 m) was analysed from logbook statistics and vessel monitoring system data for 2010-2012 at a grid cell resolution of 1 1 min longitude and latitude. Trawling intensity profiles with seabed impact at the surface and subsurface level are presented for 14 management areas in the North-east Atlantic, Baltic Sea and Mediterranean Sea. The footprint of the management areas ranged between 53-99% and 6-94% for the depth zone from 0 to 200 m (Shallow) and from 201 to 1000 m (Deep), respectively. The footprint was estimated as the total area of all grid cells that were trawled fully or partially. Excluding the untrawled proportions reduced the footprint estimates to 28-85% and 2-77%. Largest footprints per unit landings were observed off Portugal and in the Mediterranean Sea. Mean trawling intensity ranged between 0.5 and 8.5 times per year, but was less in the Deep zone with a maximum intensity of 6.4. Highest intensities were recorded in the Skagerrak-Kattegat, Iberian Portuguese area, Tyrrhenian Sea and Adriatic Sea. Bottom trawling was highly aggregated. For the Shallow zone the seabed area where 90% of the effort occurred comprised between 17% and 63% (median 36%) of the management area. Footprints were high over a broad range of soft sediment habitats. Using the longevity distribution of the untrawled infaunal community, the seabed integrity was estimated as the proportion of the biomass of benthic taxa where the trawling interval at the subsurface level exceeds their life span. Seabed integrity was low (>0.1) in large parts of the European continental shelfs, although smaller pockets of seabed with higher integrity values occur. The methods developed here integrate official fishing effort statistics and industry-based gear information to provide high-resolution pressure maps and indicators, which greatly improve the basis for assessing and managing benthic pressure from bottom trawling. Further they provide quantitative estimates of trawling impact on a continuous scale by which managers can steer. © International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2016.

Here, we investigated the effects of a 40-year trawling ban on the status of targeted and non-targeted marine species within a major fishing ground in the northeastern Mediterranean Sea (Thermaikos Gulf, Aegean Sea). Biomass and somatic length of fish and invertebrates (six commercial and three non-commercial demersal species) were measured in three areas of varying fishing pressure, depending on the temporal and spatial operational regimes of fishing vessels. The positive effects of fishing restrictions on the studied demersal stocks were clearly revealed, as the commercial fish species exhibited higher biomass in the intermediate and low pressure areas, as well as increasing maximum and mean total length (and other length indicators) with decreasing fishing effort. The mean total length of non-commercial species generally did not differ among areas, except for species caught and discarded at high rates. The present study shows that fishing does alter the population structure and biomass of commercial demersal species, and that fishing restrictions greatly contribute to improving the status of demersal populations within the restricted areas by providing a refuge for large individuals and their important contribution to the gene pool.",English,Article,"Green Published, gold",,,CS - Mediterranean,"50,000-100,000",year,"50,000-100,000",year,,,,,,Mediterranean,CS,Fisheries Restricted Area (FRA),Species protection-Discard reduction,Social,Positive,Individual,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Length of the fleet,Biomass,Trawl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Despite the huge foregone economic losses from such closures, the efficacy of them has yet to be examined in Turkey. This study compares the monthly landed catch distribution for commercial marine species averaged for 12 years (20062017) from Istanbul fish market, to catch rates of those species during the spawning seasons. Our results revealed that at first glance, most commercially important fish species examined here have their spawning seasons protected under the Turkish industrial seasonal closure period, especially for small and medium pelagics, as well as some demersals. On the other hand, taxa with winter spawning seasons such as Merlangius merlangus, John dory Zeus faber, brown meagre Sciaena umbra, big-scale sand smelt Atherina boyeri, and bogue Boops boops do not benefit from the commercial fisheries summer closure (>50% of their catch total). Also, some species are still heavily fished (>35% of their catch total) during the closure implying they are mainly targeted by small-scale fisheries (SSF). To help rebuild the commercial fisheries, we recommend the accompaniment of the industrial closure with the use of Real Time Closures (RTCs) applied to all fishing sectors for species highly fished during their spawning periods and spawning habitats. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,,Scopus,,CS - Mediterranean,">100,000",decade,">100,000",decade,,,,,,Mediterranean,CS,Seasonal closure,Stock recovery,Social,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Spawning stock biomass (SSB),Spawning season,Unspecified,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The framework is demonstrated by applying it to a Mediterranean demersal fishery (GSA 18, Southern Adriatic Sea), for which a set of management scenarios are evaluated against their ability to cope with environmental, economic and social objectives. To this aim, (1) a suite of biological and socioeconomic indicators is identified and organized into an appropriate hierarchy; (2) a set of utility functions is defined to express the level of satisfaction associated with different values of the indicators; and (3) a set of weights, representing the relative importance of each indicator to the overall utility, is derived through a pair-wise comparison of the indicators. The proposed approach provides a practical decision-support tool to identify the management scenarios that are most desirable from the society[U+05F3]s perspective, thus providing a good compromise between the environmental, economic and social aspects of the problem.

Designed to support fishery managers dealing with complex, multi-annual management plans, the model can be used to quantitatively test the consequences of various stock-specific and fishery-specific decisions, using non-equilibrium stock dynamics. Such decisions include fishing restrictions and other strategies aimed at achieving sustainable mixed fisheries consistent with the concept of maximum sustainable yield (MSY). In order to test the model, recently gathered data on seven stocks and four fisheries operating in the Ligurian and North Tyrrhenian Seas are used to generate quantitative, 10 year predictions of biomass and catch trends under four different management scenarios. The results show that using the fishing mortality at MSY as the biological reference point for the management of all stocks would be a strong incentive to reduce the technical interactions among concurrent fishing strategies.

In Scotland, the form of stakeholder involvement ranges from consultation, with an advisory function, to involvement in planning and decision-making processes. Using two Inshore Fisheries Groups (IFGs) as case studies, the present paper assesses the association between participation and satisfaction of stakeholders in the decision-making process for the development and implementation of their management plans. A survey was conducted through face-to-face interviews with the stakeholders. Spearman's correlation analysis, multiple linear regression and ordered logistic regression models were used to assess and explore the associations between stakeholders' participation and satisfaction perceptions towards the process of developing and implementing fisheries plans. The results suggest a statistically significant positive relationship between stakeholders' participation and satisfaction levels. The relationship can be affected by demographic and business characteristics, and the study revealed differences in the level of satisfaction between the two IFGs investigated. Results indicate that increasing stakeholders' satisfaction in the management process plays a key role in the success of increasing stakeholders' participation in decision-making process for the management of the Scottish IFGs and EU fisheries as a whole. Such an assessment provides a better understanding of the motives that may increase the chance of successful stakeholder' participation in fisheries management. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",English,Article,,Scopus,,North Sea - non CS,"50,000-100,000",year,"50,000-100,000",year,Simulated dynamics,correlation and regresion analysis,2,2,2,North Sea,non-CS,Unspecified,"Conflict avoidance (Economic, Social, Environmental)",Social,Positive,Country level,Regression analysis,Unspecified,Small-scale,Unspecified,Recreation,Trawl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

However, not all reserves perform equally, and predicting the response of marine communities to management actions in the long run is challenging. Our decadal-scale survey of recreational fishing yields at Frances 45-year old Cerbère-Banyuls marine reserve indicated significant protection benefits, with 4050% higher fishing yields per unit effort in the partial-protection zone of the reserve (where fishing is permitted but at a lower level) than in surrounding non-reserve areas. Over the period 20052014, catch per unit effort (CPUE) declined both inside and outside the reserve, while weight per unit effort (WPUE) increased by 131% inside and decreased by 60% outside. Different CPUE and WPUE trajectories among fish families indicated changing catch assemblages, with yields increasing for the family most valued by fisheries, Sparidae (the ecological winners). However, reserve benefits were restricted to off-shore fishermen (the social winners), as on-shore yields were ~4 times lower and declining, even inside the reserve. Our study illustrates how surveys of recreational fishing yields can help evaluate the effectiveness of marine protected areas for key social and ecological protagonists. We show that, more than four decades after its establishment, fishing efficiencies at the historical Cerbère-Banyuls marine reserve are still changing, but benefits in terms of catch abundance, weight, and composition remain predominantly restricted to off-shore fishermen. Further regulations appear necessary to guarantee that conservation strategies equitably benefit societal groups. © 2020 Kayal et al.

From the early 2000s, discarding of common megrim in the northern North Sea has been widespread. In this study, we investigated temporal variation in megrim discarding in the mixed demersal fishery in the northern North Sea before, and following recent quota increases. Furthermore, logistic regression models were applied to investigate the effects of a range of explanatory factors on the probability of individual fish being discarded. Results indicate that discarding on the vessels sampled has declined from an average of 54% of the total common megrim catch in 2009 to 20% in 2012. The decrease in total discards was primarily a result of a decrease in the proportions of discards categorized by the crew as small within the catches from 0.39 (±0.02 s.e.) in 2009 to 0.10 (±0.01 s.e.) in 2012. Model outputs also suggest that the likelihood of a fish being discarded decreases significantly (p < 0.001) with increasing quota. The current megrim total allowable catch serves only to regulate landings and does little to regulate fishing mortality. Additionally, the proposed reform of the CFP, including the move towards a discards ban and the implementation of maximum sustainable yield, raises a number of concerns that need to be addressed if the northern North Sea mixed demersal fishery is to be managed sustainably and remain economically viable in the future. © 2014 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

This change has been recommended in the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean and European Commission regulations. However, ecosystem-based assessment of improved selectivity still remains a challenge, and that is the aim of this study. For this purpose, an Ecopath model was developed and used to initialize dynamic simulations in Ecosim. The simulations changed gear-specific fishing mortality rates to represent the shifting from traditional codend to alternative codends. Our results suggest that the use of D50 or S40 codends would have a positive impact on the ecosystem as a whole and on the stock status of several commercial and non-commercial groups. Mixed trophic impact analysis indicated that, for species, like red mullet, the S40 codend was significantly better than the D50 codend. This information can be useful to policymakers, particularly for the areas where red mullet is the main target species and could inform trawl mesh options in the eastern Mediterranean. © 2020 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2020.

The framework uses species sales notes by commercial size category, the length and age composition of commercial sizes from onshore sampling and the fishing ground and fishing effort from vessel monitoring system records. We apply the framework to horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus), one of the most important commercially exploited stocks throughout the Northeast Atlantic, using data collected during 2017 in Portuguese waters. We show that high-resolution mapping of the species annual landings by commercial size category and age group can already reveal different distribution patterns by life stage. We further examined, with daily resolution, the variability in the proportion of adult fish by trip, finding differences along the coast and a seasonal pattern indicating that spawning occurred mainly over the slope and adult horse mackerel dominated in the South zone over the year.

Methods used to calculate fishing vessel emissions inventories have traditionally utilised estimates of fuel efficiency per unit of catch. These methods have weaknesses because they do not easily allow temporal and geographical allocation of emissions. A large proportion of fishing and other small commercial vessels are also omitted from global shipping emissions inventories such as the International Maritime Organisation's Greenhouse Gas Studies. This paper demonstrates an activity-based methodology for the production of temporally- and spatially-resolved emissions inventories using data produced by Automatic Identification Systems (AIS). The methodology addresses the issue of how to use AIS data for fleets where not all vessels use AIS technology and how to assign engine load when vessels are towing trawling or dredging gear. The results of this are compared to a fuel-based methodology using publicly available European Commission fisheries data on fuel efficiency and annual catch. The results show relatively good agreement between the two methodologies, with an estimate of 295.7 kilotons of fuel used and 914.4 kilotons of carbon dioxide emitted between May 2012 and May 2013 using the activity-based methodology. Different methods of calculating speed using AIS data are also compared. The results indicate that using the speed data contained directly in the AIS data is preferable to calculating speed from the distance and time interval between consecutive AIS data points. © 2015 The Authors.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,,NE-Atlantic,">100,000",year,"500-1,000",subday,Fisheries Dependent Data,bottom-up activity-based methodology,2,2,3,NE-Atlantic,non-CS,Environmental measures and Habitats protection policies,Fleet Efficiency ,Social,Unspecified,Country level,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Fuel costs,Pollution,Seine_Trawl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

Marine protected areas (MPAs) with partial fishing restrictions are socially more acceptable, but their ecological effectiveness has largely not been assessed. The effects of establishing partial reserves on a target species, forkbeard, Phycis phycis (Linnaeus, 1766), were assessed in MPAs in the Mediterranean: Cap de Creus (Spain) and Lastovo (Croatia). Materials and methods. In this study, we performed separate statistical analyses based on measurements of length and age for 381 forkbeard from Cap de Creus (2008- 2011) and 739 forkbeard from Lastovo Islands (2010-2012) as indicators of fishing effects on target fish populations. Results. The establishment of partial reserves in both MPAs, with different regulations imposed on professional and recreational fishing has not proven successful in achieving benefits for a sedentary, relatively long-lived target species such as Phycis phycis. Results of multi-annual research indicate no significant difference in the abundance, mean size, or age of P. phycis between the fishing zones of different protection levels in either of the studied MPAs. Conclusion. In order to achieve the desired benefits for coastal fisheries resources, we recommend that partial fishing reserves are supplemented with integrated networks of no-take zones. © 2015, Scientific Society of Szczecin.

In multi-gear mixed fisheries, where many fleets exploit the same species, reallocation of fishing effort can optimize the biological and socioeconomic output of the fishery. Most existing effort allocation tools require extensive data for their parameterization (i.e. detailed effort data and/or analytical assessment of stock status). We present a low-data demanding effort allocation framework for fisheries managed through effort control, with minimum data requirements the surplus production assessment of key stock, catch shares and basic economic fleet data. Profit maximization is considered the overall management goal, which is constrained by single-species biological targets. The method is tested on the Aegean Sea demersal fishery, where two fleet segments exploit numerous species. To achieve sustainable exploitation for the main Aegean stocks, the total effort should be reduced by ?30%. The framework allows integrating various biological, economic, or other objectives and provides a simple graphical illustration of the allocation result, which can provide a useful tool to convey complex information to managers.

An LFI calculated from an eight-species subset correlated closely with the full community LFI, thereby permitting an exploration of the effects of various fishing scenarios on projected values of the LFI using an extension of a previously published multi-species length-structured model that included these key species. The model replicated historical changes in biomass and size composition of individual species, and generated an LFI that was significantly correlated with observations. A community-wide reduction in fishing mortality of ~60% from 2008 values was necessary to meet the LFI target, driven mainly by changes in cod and saithe. A 70% reduction in cod fishing mortality alone, or a 75% reduction in otter trawl effort, was also sufficient to achieve the target.

Five groups defined by the combination of these biological traits represented different levels of vulnerability to trawling. Results based on analysis of the relative abundance of these groups at each site showed that the biological traits significantly reflected ecosystem disturbance, with the less disturbed communities having the highest abundance of groups considered vulnerable to trawling.

Danish seining is a specialised fishing method that targeted few species but with higher total catch rates than bottom trawlers. Bottom trawling is a more all-purpose fishing method that targets a larger number of species, and bottom trawlers use larger engines than Danish seiners. A generalised additive mixed model indicated that catch rates of flatfish are generally higher for Danish seines, and catch rates of roundfish species are higher for trawlers.

Several fishing activities operate simultaneously in the area, and the need to minimize conflicts among them is also a social concern. We applied a spatially and temporally explicit fish and fisheries model to assess the impact of a suite of spatial plans suggested by practitioners that could reduce the pressure on the four demersal stocks of high commercial interest in the GSA 17 and that could promote space sharing between mutually exclusive activities. We found that excluding trawlers from some areas has lowered the effective fishing effort, resulting in some economic losses but providing benefit to the set netters. Not every simulated fishing vessel is impacted in the same way because some fishing communities experienced different economic opportunities, particularly when a 6-nautical mile buffer zone from the coast was implemented in the vicinity of important fishing grounds. Along this buffer zone, the four stocks were only slightly benefiting from the protection of the area and from fewer discards. In contrast, assuming a change in the ability of the population to disperse led to a large effect: Some fish became accessible in the coastal waters, therefore increasing the landings for rangelimited fishers, but the discard rate of fish also increased, greatly impairing the long-term biomass levels. Our evaluation, however, confirmed that no effort is displaced onto vulnerable benthic habitats and to grounds not suitable for the continued operation of fishing. We conclude that the tested spatial management is helpful, but not sufficient to ensure sustainable fishing in the area, and therefore, additional management measures should be taken.

The results suggest that only small portions of the area of interest are used by the trawl fleet, opening the possibility for a trawl ban without major disruption of the trawling activity. Economic benefits are expected, since predictions two scenarios tested, heavy and moderate exploitation, indicate no loss of catch value with much lower operational costs.

To investigate the potentials and challenges of these paradigm shifts, a 6-months unrestricted gear' trial was performed in Denmark in 2015. Twelve trawlers were challenged to test their own solutions to reduce unwanted bycatch and/or choke species, while maintaining profitable. The participating fishers tested different options depending on their fishery and the type of issues they faced individually, and adjusted their test fishery over time through incremental small steps. Nine vessels reduced discard ratio in the test fishery, one showed no difference between test and control fishery, while two vessels displayed an increase in discard ratio. Catch compositions also differed, with fewer ""choke species"" occurring in the test fisheries and a more valuable size composition. Ultimately, despite smaller landings in multiple vessels, no vessel showed reduction in value-per-unit-effort (VPUE) and one Baltic vessel significantly increased the VPUE. This trial showed that relaxing technical regulations combined with proper incentives has a potential to provide some flexibility to cope with the landing obligation, where unwanted catches could be reduced to some extent without negative effects on economic viability. © International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2017.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,,North Sea - non CS,"1,000-5,000",half year,"1,000-5,000",day,Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey,Linear Regression,2,2,2,North Sea,non-CS,Landing obligation,Fleet Efficiency ,Social,Positive,Country level,Generalized Linear Models,Unspecified,Large-scale,Landings (value),Economic Performance,Trawl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Despite this, access to public fish resources in the EU and its member states are granted without any social or environmental conditions. Without these, the process of allocating quotas - essentially determining the future health of marine resources and the fishing industry - is blind to virtually all of the impacts of fisheries. Here, the United Kingdom's North Sea cod fishery is studied, comparing the social, environmental and economic impacts of trawlers and gillnets, the two major fishing gears targeting cod in this area. Comparisons are also made on a vessel-length basis to address recent debate concerning the benefits of small-scale fisheries. The results show that, for each tonne of cod landed in these fisheries, all trawlers have impacts that are more costly than the value of their landings. There are also vessel length-specific differences, with the largest trawlers the most destructive (-£1992/tonne and -£2.50/fish). Gillnets, on the other hand, generate positive value to society (+£865/tonne and +£2.16/fish). Despite these impacts, gillnets land only 1% as much cod as trawlers do. The results support the policy implementation of access criteria into the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, to ensure fishermen generate positive outcomes for society and to provide incentives that align fishermen's interests with conservation objectives. © 2012.",English,Article,,Scopus,,North Sea - non CS,">100,000",two year,,day,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey,,2,1,2,North Sea,non-CS,Allocation of rights,Stock recovery,Social,Negative,Region level,Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA),Unspecified,Various,Costs (variable),Fleet efficiency,Trawl_Gillnets,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

In this respect, we argue that new and diversified institutional arrangements combined with building social capital can help reach long-term economic sustainability for small-scale fisheries businesses, as well as the social-ecological resilience of coastal areas.

Trade-offs between ecological and socioeconomic impacts are highlighted and the effectiveness of governance scenarios is discussed in regard to the challenge of capacity adjustment. Results emphasize that the introduction of ITQs is expected to reduce by 40% the number of vessels in the fishery. While effectively mitigating the economic impacts of the transition phase to maximum sustainable yield, ITQs are also expected to increase substantially the fishing effort by trawlers, which may cause ecological concerns. The scenarios tested also include the simulation of a decommissioning scheme where subsequent decommissioned vessels are considerably different from the vessels that would lease out their quotas in an ITQ system, resulting in differentiated ecological and socioeconomic impacts between scenarios. © 2018, Canadian Science Publishing.

Relational data of fishers have been used in this paper as a lens through which to explore the status of their participation in Marine Protected Area (MPA) management and to identify structural and contextual barriers to participation. Fieldwork was carried out during 20132015 in Cabo de Palos-Islas Hormigas MPA (CPH-MPA) using a mixed method approach involving the collection and analysis of data from institutional surveys and community meetings. The analysis shows that the fishers self-perception of having low influence in decision-making is consistent with the perception towards fishers of the wider social system. Several barriers and constraints to participation in CPH-MPA management are identified. The inefficient structure of the information exchange network further explained fishers feelings of distrust and marginalisation regarding decision-making. Understanding how structural barriers make it difficult to set in motion a collective learning process  necessary for an efficient decision-making process  breaks new ground for the design of interventions. Recommendations include clarifying the scope for participation in an appropriate institutional setting and careful consideration of the space in which dialogue takes place in order to integrate diverse knowledge and to acknowledge differential power relations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,,Mediterranean - non CS,5-10,two year,5-10,quarter,,,,,,Mediterranean,non-CS,Marine Protected Area (MPA),Species protection-Discard reduction,Social,Negative,Individual,Generalized Linear Models,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The GoA differs from neighboring ecosystems of the Western Mediterranean Sea because of its different oceanographic characteristics. We developed a model of the study area representing early 2010s, covering a total area of 7085 km2, and including the continental shelf and upper slope with depths from 50 to 800 m. In total, 45 functional groups considering all components of the food web (fish, marine mammals, seabirds, invertebrates, primary producers, and detritus) were selected to build the ecological model. The fishery was represented by the four main fleets operating in the area (i.e., bottom trawl, purse seine, longlines, and small-scale fisheries) and we included official landing data and estimated percentage of discarded species. Results were then compared with available outputs of available models representing adjacent ecosystems such as the Gulf of Cadiz (in the Atlantic side) and the North Western Mediterranean Sea (north of the study area). The study revealed that the major differences found between models were due to the lower primary production in the GoA. This led to lower catches and higher importance of the demersal compartment, where the most biomass was associated to the detritus. The main trophic flows in the GoA were originated at the basis of the food web, likely related to bottom-up flow control. Interactions between pelagic and demersal groups were weaker than in neighboring areas. Despite the high values of ecotrophic efficiencies and mortality rates, results showed a lower fishing pressure than in neighboring areas, suggesting a moderate exploitation level of marine resources in the GoA. This study fills a knowledge gap in the area and sets the baseline to develop future studies to test scenarios of change and management options. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",English,Article,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,,Mediterranean - non CS,10-50,Unspecified,5-10,,,,,,,Mediterranean,non-CS,Marine Protected Area (MPA),Species protection-Discard reduction,Social,Negative,Individual,GOA model,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Biomass,Unspecified,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Incentives for fishers to change their behaviours depend on their economic performances as well as their ability to avoid bycatch. Changes in economic performances under the LO are evaluated based on cost and revenue equations. The nested grid method is then used to explore the spatial and temporal distribution of landings and discards, and to suggest alternative effort allocation to avoid bycatch. This article is focussed specifically on the French otter trawl fishery in the eastern English Channel and southern North Sea. Results suggest that under the LO the choke species problem will curtail fishing activities earlier in the year, leading to significant economic losses. In the absence of significant quota top-ups (at least 75%), a change in fishing practices consisting in reducing overall bycatch by 30% is insufficient to reduce losses. With a particular attention to choke species, more economically efficient avoidance strategies can be found thanks to the nested grid method. © 2019 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2019.

Since then, electric trawling has expanded beyond regulatory threshold: 84 large trawlers now catch the vast majority of the Dutch flatfish quota, causing detrimental socio-environmental impacts. To assess whether the European Union's fisheries policies fulfilled legal objectives and implemented the 2030 Agenda, it appeared crucial to quantify how much public financial aid had been provided to the Dutch fishing sector for its conversion to electric trawling. The financial information enabling this evaluation was first concealed but was eventually obtained. We show that the institutional opacity surrounding electric trawling was not serendipitous and has served to dissimulate allocations of public monies to a prohibited fishing method (otter trawl), illegal licenses, and falsely scientific fishing. In breach of EU laws, 20.8 million EUR of structural funds have so far been granted to this sector in the form of direct subsidies, i.e. over 30 times the amount acknowledged by the fishing industry. The findings presented here lift part of the veil surrounding electric trawling, but the complete reconstruction of the impacts of this fishing method can only be done when decision-makers and scientists disclose all data in full transparency and become the warrants of the public interest. © 2019 The Authors",English,Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,,CS - North Sea,">100,000",decade,,decade,Behavioural Observations,none,2,2,2,North Sea,CS,Subsidies,Fleet Efficiency ,Social,Positive,Country level,Unspecified,Unspecified,Large-scale,Costs (variable),Compliance,Trawl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

An emerging view on fisheries management emphasizes the need to manage fisheries as complex social-ecological systems. Yet, our understanding of the outcomes of fisheries management from a social-ecological perspective is limited in comparison to that provided by either the biophysical or the social perspective alone. In the Baltic Sea, management interventions focused on ecosystem recovery contributed to unintended changes from 1996 to 2009 in the fishing strategy diversity practiced by Swedish fishers. We evaluate how the changes in strategy diversification affected the capacity of Swedish fishers to adapt to future ecosystem changes. To do this, we constructed and analyzed social-ecological fisheries networks. Our analysis confirmed the previously reported development of a narrower combination of fishing strategies among large-scale fishers, parallel with a diversification in small-scale fishers strategies. However, the results demonstrated that switching fishing strategies has, in fact, increased in magnitude, and the fishers were more equally distributed in different fishing strategies in 2009 than in 1996. Further, we detected a development toward lower ecological dependency between fishing strategies within the community, although the strategies remained connected through ecological interactions. In conclusion, our analysis of the social-ecological interdependencies suggests that the previously reported changes in the fishing strategy diversity increased the adaptability of the Swedish Baltic Sea fishers to changing ecological conditions. On the other hand, the changes may have made the Baltic Sea more vulnerable to poor management. This empirical study emphasizes the importance of a social-ecological approach on fisheries research and management. Our results show that appreciating the complexity and changing nature of fisher behavior is crucial when assessing fisheries management outcomes, and when designing policies that aim to maintain adaptability in the uncertain and dynamic fish industry. © 2018 by the author(s).",English,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,,CS - Baltic Sea,">100,000",decade,"500-1,000",decade,Fisheries Dependent Data,social-ecological motifs analysis_social ecological network analysis,2,2,2,Baltic Sea,CS,Unspecified,Unspecified,Social,Neutral,Country level,Network analysis,Unspecified,Various,Fishing Effort (days at sea),Adaptive Capacity,Trawl_Gillnets_Longlines_Driftnets,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Human adaptation is often considered a key uncertainty, and there are few quantitative empirical analyses that address long-term social and ecological change in the analyses of fisheries systems. The aim of this study was twofold: (i) to understand how different drivers influenced the adaptations by fishers, and (ii) to evaluate different consequences of such adaptations, especially with regard to diversity of social and ecological links. We used the Baltic Sea as a case study, a system with different fisheries, largely managed with a single-stock advice, in a top-down basis. The study period 19952009 was characterized by profound inter-annual fluctuations in fish stock status and prices, and introduction of new types of management measures. We used multivariate statistical methods to define longitudinal changes in fishing tactics and strategies based on logbook data. Our results indicate that changes in fishing strategies have mainly been driven by regulations, and there were only weak linkages between fishing activities, fish stocks, and price fluctuations. We found contrasting trends between large- and small-scale fishers, where large-scale fishers became more specialized and inflexible, whereas small-scale fishers diversified over time. We conclude that management has had a dominating role in shaping fishing patterns, leading to a reduction of important qualities related to the resilience in this social-ecological system. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",English,Article,,Scopus,,CS - Baltic Sea,">100,000",decade,"500-1,000",year,Fisheries Dependent Data,PCA_MCA_Time series analysis,2,2,2,Baltic Sea,CS,Bycatch reduction,Unspecified,Social,Unspecified,Country level,Time series,Unspecified,Various,Landings (volume),Resilience,Trawl_Gillnets_Longlines_Driftnets,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Overall POP levels in the sediment were low. The average PCB and PBDE concentrations were respectively 31.5 and 115. ng/g dry weight (dw). Highest sediment loads were measured in the vicinity of Antwerp (368. ng PCBs/g dw), a location with intense harbor and industrial activities. Pollution concentrations in the tissues of biota were species-specific. Blue mussels contained the highest lipid concentrations (2.74 ± 0.55%) and reached the highest contamination levels (from 287 to 1688. ng PCBs/g ww, from 2.09 to 12.4. ng PBDEs/g ww). Lowest tissue loads were measured in brown shrimp (from 3.27 to 39.9. ng PCBs/g ww, from 0.05 to 0.47. ng PBDEs/g ww). The PCB congener profile in most of the species was similar with the pattern found in the sediment. PCB 153 was the most abundant congener (16.5-25.7% in biota, 10.4% in sediment). In the sediment, the total amount of PBDEs consisted for more than 99% of BDE 209. Congener BDE 47 had the highest concentrations in all sampled species (38.5-70.1%). Sediment POP loadings and tissue concentrations were poorly correlated, indicating that a simple linear or non-linear relationship is insufficient to describe this relationship, possible caused by the complexity of the bioaccumulation processes and the variability in exposure. Because of the high PCB levels, regular consumption of fish and seafood, especially mussels, from the Scheldt estuary should be avoided. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",English,Article,,Scopus,,CS - North Sea,"50,000-100,000",year,"10,000-50,000",quarter,,mass spectometry,2,2,3,North Sea,CS,minimum risk levels,Health,Social,Negative,Country level,Unspecified,Unspecified,Small-scale,Unspecified,Pollution,Fyke nets_Trawl_Handlines,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

In particular, ignoring joint production when setting total allowable catches (TACs) for individual species is likely to lead to over-quota discards or, when discards are not allowed, to lost fishing opportunities. Furthermore, economic and social objectives have been poorly addressed in the design of fisheries harvest strategies, despite being an explicit objective of ecosystem-based fisheries management in many jurisdictions worldwide. We introduce the notion of operating space as the ensemble of reachable, single-species fishing mortality targets, given joint production in a mixed fishery. We then use the concept of eco-viability to identify TAC combinations which simultaneously account for multiple objectives. The approach is applied to the joint management of hake and sole fishing in the Bay of Biscay, also accounting for catches of Norway lobster, European seabass and anglerfish. Results show that fishing at the upper end of the MSY range for sole and slightly above Fmsy for hake can generate gains in terms of long-term economic viability of the fleets without impeding the biological viability of the stocks, nor the incentives for crews to remain in the fishery. We also identify reachable fishing mortality targets in the MSY ranges for these two species, given existing technical interactions. © 2019, The Author(s).",English,Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,,CS - Western Waters,">100,000",decade,,year,Fisheries Dependent Data,bio-economic model IAM; Integrated ecological economic fisheries model,2,2,3,Western Waters,CS,Total Allowable Catch (TAC),Fleet Efficiency ,Social,Positive,Country level,"Bioeconomic modelling (BEMCOM, BEMTOOL, FLBEIA, MEFISTO, FISHRENT, Impact Assessment Models (IAMS), SMART, EFIMAS)",Unspecified,Various,Costs (Total)_Fishing Effort (days at sea)_Employment on board (crew)_Landings (volume)_Profit (gross)_Number of vessels ,Economic Performance,Various,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Studies on the impacts and benefits to socio-ecosystems and mental health are driving this gradual awareness. In the Mediterranean, MRF is currently responsible for 10% of the catches though, in the context of small-scale fisheries decline, it may become dominant. Sustaining this activity represents a universal challenge for the future of mankind. However, the potential influence of anglers' heterogeneity on both the environment and the Catch Per Unit of Effort (CPUE), used internationally to evaluate fish harvest and as a stocks indicator, hinders MRF management. In addition, little data is available on onshore fishing, while the number of practitioners may increase sharply in the context of a socio-economic crisis, especially in marine protected areas (MPA). We conducted a year-round survey in 20172018 in a French Mediterranean MPA subject to tourist flows, during which 144 onshore anglers were polled by semi-directive interviews. We used a typology based on technical and socio-economic data of anglers to describe their behaviour diversity and its influence on CPUE and, more broadly, the marine environment in multi-species fisheries. We characterised four onshore angler profiles, segregated in space and time, including one identified as at risk of causing impacts. Our analyses support using total and per species CPUE independently of profiles to evaluate onshore MRF harvest, except for four species. CPUE seem based on the profiles skills and self-regulation which induce similar yields between anglers in the absence of control. This demonstrates the importance of taking into account angler behaviour, as each profile could react differently to management actions and highlights that CPUE could be used to detect the effect of changes in regulation in the framework of adaptive management. Our results support that MRF regulations should be simplified and homogenised at the national level and cooperation with fishing shops in MPA co-management should be promoted. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",English,Article,,Scopus,,CS - Mediterranean,10-50,year,100-500,day,Behavioural Observations,Multiple correspondences factorial analysis,2,2,3,Mediterranean,CS,Unspecified,Unspecified,Social,Unspecified,Unspecified,Ascending Hierarchical Classification,Unspecified,Recreational,Landings (volume),Compliance_Recreation_Stock Protection,Hooks,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Benthic organisms are likely to be particularly affected by the impacts of climate change due to their low spatial mobility, which limits their capacity for adaptation. Therefore, SSFs that target sedentary resources (S-fisheries) will potentially be among the most impacted types of fishery. The pathways of such impacts can be studied in an integrated approach by means of social-ecological vulnerability assessment. The stalked barnacle (Pollicipes pollicipes) fishery, one of the most important S-fisheries in Galicia (NW Spain), represents a complex social-ecological system rooted within the culture of the region. Along Galician coast, this benthic resource is co-managed by the territorial use rights in fisheries (TURFs) scheme. The vulnerability assessment involves ranking TURF systems according to the exposure of the resource to climate hazards, the sensitivity of dependent people and the capacity of the system to adapt to the impacts. After analyzing 26 stalked barnacle TURFs (79% of all Galician TURFs), we identified the most vulnerable zones (Muxía and O Pindo), as indicated by high levels of ecological vulnerability and social sensitivity and low adaptive capacity. We discuss different ways of increasing the adaptive capacity of TURFs based on local knowledge and literature reviews. Vulnerability assessment represents a powerful tool that can be used to help policy-makers develop adaptation strategies needed at different time scales, ultimately contributing towards better informed, sustainable and efficient fisheries management. © 2020",English,Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,,CS - Western Waters,100-500,decade,"5,000-10,000",decade,Behavioural Observations,Visual interpreation of scatterplots,2,1,1,Western Waters,CS,Unspecified,Sustainability-Biodiversity protection,Social,Neutral,Region level,social-ecological vulnerability framework,Unspecified,Small-scale,Unspecified,Adaptive Capacity_Sustainability-Resilience_social security_Fishing tactic_fishing dependency_poaching_Employment_wellbeing_independency_Management strategies,Unspecified,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Additionally, the exploitation of mixed fisheries by heterogeneous fleets complicates their management because of the necessity to allocate catch or effort quotas, under some criterion of efficiency or equitability. The allocation of fishing opportunities impacts directly on the availability of jobs in fisheries. To analyse the trade-offs between employment and profits in mixed fisheries, an optimization bioeconomic model was built for the three bottom-trawl fleet segments operating in the Catalonia demersal fishery (NW Mediterranean Sea). The fishery is subject to a multiannual management plan to align fishing effort with the fisheries mortality that would produce the maximum sustainable yield. The optimal effort allocation among the three fleet segments were compared subject to alternative fisheries management policies: (i) maximum sustainable yield, (ii) maximum economic yield, (iii) maximum labour remuneration, (iv) pretty good yield, and (v) equilibrium biomass larger than biomass at maximum sustainable yield, taking into account the multispecies nature of the fishery. The results show that all management policies provide higher profits than current. In the first three scenarios, high profitability can be made compatible with a lower number of better paid jobs, because the optimal allocation of effort in most scenarios would imply a reduction in the number of vessels. The results also show that the current number of vessels and effort distribution (which are the result of a historical process, rather than the results of a management strategy) are far from any optimum. © 2021 The Author(s)",English,Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,,CS - Mediterranean,">100,000",decade,"5,000-10,000",year,Fisheries Dependent Data,Optimised bioeconomic simulation model ,2,2,3,Mediterranean,CS,Effort Control,Stock recovery,Social,Negative,Country level,"Bioeconomic modelling (BEMCOM, BEMTOOL, FLBEIA, MEFISTO, FISHRENT, Impact Assessment Models (IAMS), SMART, EFIMAS)",Unspecified,Various,Landings (volume)_Fishing Effort (days at sea)_Costs (variable)_Fuel costs_Costs (fixed)_Taxation_Labor cost_Fish price,Economic Performance_Stock Protection_Employment,Trawl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Among fishing practices, discarding fish is a waste of valuable resources and results in lost income that is associated with its effects on future stock growth. This practice depends on several factors, although trawl fisheries account for the highest quantity of discards. In this work, the effects of a specific section of the Galician (Northwestern Spain) bottom trawl fishery were evaluated by using the ecological footprint, focusing on the contribution of the rate of discards. We selected fishing grounds and carbon footprints as the categories for the analysis. The results showed that 11.6 global hectares (gha) per metric ton of catch were required for an average fishing trip, ranging between 2.2 and 27.1 gha per metric ton. Discards represented 55% of this value, while the carbon footprint only represented 11%. Therefore, measures are needed to reduce the significant effects of discards, especially in these fisheries. The findings indicate that the discard ban promoted by the Common Fisheries Policy could reduce the ecological footprint of these fisheries by 3.4 gha per metric ton of catch landed on average. © 2020 American Fisheries Society",English,Article,,Scopus,,CS - Western Waters,">100,000",two year,"5,000-10,000",subday,Fisheries Dependent Data,Ecological footprint estimation,1,1,1,Western Waters,CS,Landing obligation,Sustainability-Biodiversity protection,Environmental,Negative,Country level,Indicators analysis,trophic level; discards,Large-scale,Fuel costs,Sustainability-Resilience,Trawl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
