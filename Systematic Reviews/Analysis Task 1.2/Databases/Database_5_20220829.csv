Understanding the factors governing range shifts is crucial for conservation management to anticipate patterns of biodiversity distribution under future anthropogenic climate change. Soft-sediment invertebrates are a key faunal group because of their role in marine biogeochemistry and as a food source for commercial fish species. However, little information exists on their response to climate change. Here, we evaluate changes in the distribution of 65 North Sea benthic invertebrate species between 1986 and 2000 by examining their geographic, bathymetric and thermal niche shifts and test whether species are tracking their thermal niche as defined by minimum, mean or maximum sea bottom (SBT) and surface (SST) temperatures. Temperatures increased in the whole North Sea with many benthic invertebrates showing north-westerly range shifts (leading/trailing edges as well as distribution centroids) and deepening. Nevertheless, distribution shifts for most species (3.8–7.3 km yr 1 interquantile range) lagged behind shifts in both SBT and SST (mean 8.1 km yr 1), resulting in many species experiencing increasing temperatures. The velocity of climate change (VoCC) of mean SST accurately predicted both the direction and magnitude of distribution centroid shifts, while maximum SST did the same for contraction of the trailing edge. The VoCC of SBT was not a good predictor of
range shifts. No good predictor of expansions of the leading edge was found. Our results show that invertebrates need to shift at different rates and directions to track the climate velocities of different temperature measures, and are therefore lagging behind most temperature measures. If these species cannot withstand a change in thermal habitat,
this could ultimately lead to a drop in benthic biodiversity.

Skewed sex ratios with a predominance of males were observed in the survey catches of 2- and 3-year-old cod taken on the spawning grounds. In contrast, commercial midwater trawl catches of cod in the same area had consistently higher sex ratios, suggesting that mature males and females have different vertical migration behaviour. Estimates of proportion mature were not affected by method of capture. In a GLM analysis, the factor age explained most of the variation in maturity in each sex, whilst length, although a significant factor, explained less variation than year and region (spawning and non-spawning grounds). Maturity was observed in a variable proportion of 2-year-olds, whilst virtually no 1-year-olds and all 3-year-olds and older were mature irrespective of area or year of capture. Population estimates of proportion mature in 2-year-olds, from all years' data combined, were 0.87 in males and 0.45 in females. Estimates were higher in spawning areas than in non-spawning areas, and showed a general increase over time throughout the survey area. However, in any year, the proportion mature at age 2 varied little with length and was reduced only in the smallest fish (<40 cm) at this age in some years. The increase over time in proportion mature coincided with rising sea surface temperature (SST) and a decline in recruitment and stock biomass at high rates of fishing mortality. Mean length-at-age differed consistently between year classes, the differences being largely established in the first year of life. The fastest growth rates were apparent in very weak year classes produced in the late 1990s when SST was relatively high. The interrelationships between growth, maturity, SST and abundance are examined, and changes in growth and maturity since earlier studies in the 1970s are investigated.

Interviews of 58 fishers from 26 harbours and meetings with national fisheries organisations and managers revealed the perception of an offshore movement of coastal cod. Numerical modelling based on fishing survey data did not substantiate these perceptions in the data-poor coastal waters. However, Data Storage Tag (DST) information combined with bottom sea water temperature data from the spatio-temporal hydrodynamic Baltic Sea Ice-Ocean Model showed changes in potential cod habitat distribution in the Skagerrak-Kattegat and western Baltic from 1979 to 2016. Subsequently, cod habitats were defined in three categories: (i) potentially suitable (T <= 12 degrees C); (ii) episodic (12 < T <= 16 degrees C); and (iii) unsuitable (T > 16 degrees C). The environmental changes were linked to the socio-economic component of cod fishery. Cod catches (weight and monetary value) were retrieved using logbook information and data from the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS, 2005-2016) and the Automatic Identification System (AIS, 2006-2016). General additive modelling significantly showed the largest proportion of catches took place in the potentially suitable habitat whereas catches were lower in the episodic habitat and rare in the unsuitable habitat. The results of this first large-scale SAF application are highly valuable for adapting existing fisheries management by: (i) providing information on habitat shrinkage for Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) based stock assessments; (ii) adding a spatio-temporal dimension for coastal productivity relative to the vessel-based Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) system; and (iii) providing a predictive scenario simulation tool for sustainable management under changing environmental conditions.",English,Article,,Web of Science,K,CS - Baltic Sea,">100,000",multidecadal,"1,000-5,000",month,Multiple,Systems Approach  Framework (SAF),2,2,3,"We showed a link between climate change and cod distribution away from the coast due to shrinkage of suitable adult cod habitat.

For North Sea cod, we show for the first time and in great spatial detail how the stock has shifted its distribution over the past 100 years. We digitized extensive historical fisheries data from paper charts in UK government archives and combined these with contemporary data to a time-series spanning 1913-2012 (excluding both World Wars). New analysis of old data revealed that the current distribution pattern of cod - mostly in the deeper, northern-and north-easternmost parts of the North Sea - is almost opposite to that during most of the Twentieth Century - mainly concentrated in the west, off England and Scotland. Statistical analysis revealed that the deepening, northward shift is likely attributable to warming; however, the eastward shift is best explained by fishing pressure, suggestive of significant depletion of the stock from its previous stronghold, off the coasts of England and Scotland. These spatial patterns were confirmed for the most recent 3 decades by data from fisheries-independent surveys, which go back to the 1970s. Our results demonstrate the fundamental importance of both climate change and fishing pressure for our understanding of changing distributions of commercially exploited fish.",English,Article,,Web of Science,K,CS - North Sea,">100,000",multidecadal,"50,000-100,000",day,Fisheries Dependent Data,Linear mixed-effects ,,,,"We conclude that North Sea cod distribution shifts are not solely attributable to climate change but rather to an interaction between climate and fishing. It is of note that North Sea cod distribution stayed fairly constant throughout the period 1920s–1980s despite variability in temperature and phase of the NAO and that the most significant shifts in the 1990s–2000s coincided with depletion and biomass decline. Since the Millennium, cod fishing mortality has been reduced as a result of strict management and a reduction of the fishing fleet (Horwood et al., 2006). There are some initial signs of stock recovery in the most recent few years(Fig. 1b; ICES, 2013c). Fishing can make populations more sensitive to climate change by reducing abundance and density, truncating the age distribution (Ottersenet al., 2006). At low abundance levels, populations may retreat to sites of optimal habitat only (Blanchard et al., 2005). Because globally, fish stocks are typically subject to the combined pressures of climate change and exploitation, and because the fishing effort is often highly concentrated at specific localities within a species overall range, there is a need for wider recognition of the dual impact that both climate and fishing can have on fish distributions.",Looked at fish distribution changes over the whole northeast Atlantic region using combined survey datasets from multiple countries and found that 70% of the fish species seemed to have responded to warming by changing distribution and abundance. ,Task 5.2 Predicting species distribution ,Gadus morhua,juv and adults,bentho-pelagic,Commercial,Demersal trawls,Otter trawl,Climate change,abundance,None/Unknown,Yes,Biomass,Negative,high,"spatiotemporal: dynamic, movement, allocation, shift, migration, displacement (e.g. by depth)",visualization/maps,visualization/maps,Yes,"This study shows that distribution shifts of North Sea cod have not been limited to the most recent three decades (as reported by Hedger et al., 2004; Perry et al.,2005; Rindorf & Lewy, 2006; Dulvy et al., 2008), but took place throughout the past 100 years. However, due to climate change and fishing pressure, the distribution has shifted more markedly in the past 2 to 3 decades than in the entire 70-years period previously, so the current distribution is very different from that during most of the Twentieth Century.

Not only did the TP of G. morhua in relation to the other fish species differ between Lofoten-Vesterålen and the North Sea, but also its reliance on benthic affinity prey was much lower in the Lofoten-Vesterålen region than in the North Sea. This high reliance on pelagic feeding prey indicates that cod stocks in the Lofoten-Vesterålen region might be affected by the northward extension of typical pelagic species (Stenevik and Sundby, 2007). With the ongoing climate change, feeding migrations of mackerel to the North are expected earlier in the season (Utne et al., 2012). This leads to a large temporal overlap of mackerel and larvae of Norwegian spring-spawning herring, and the resulting predation could have regulatory effects on the herring stock (Skaret et al., 2015), and consequently on the available food for cod. In contrast, North Sea cod relied approximately equally on pelagic and benthic affinity prey, which is in accordance with previous studies of stable isotopes from Newfoundland and Labrador (Sherwood and Rose, 2005), and stomach contents from the North Sea (Hislop et al., 1997). Today, cod is only present in very low numbers in the southern North Sea and the ecosystem has shifted toward a flatfish dominated community, along with particularly high abundances of small, demersal, mesopredatory fish (B. luteum, Arnoglossus laterna, A. cataphractus, Pomatoschistus spp.) (Daan et al., 2005; Ehrich et al., 2007; van Hal et al., 2010).

These will lead to changes in the hydrographic properties of the ocean, as well as the vertical stratification and circulation patterns. Of particular note is the expected increase in ocean temperature. Based upon the observed responses of cod to temperature variability, the expected responses of cod stocks throughout the North Atlantic to the future temperature scenarios are reviewed and discussed here. Stocks in the Celtic and Irish Seas are expected to disappear under predicted temperature changes by the year 2100, while those in the southern North Sea and Georges Bank will decline. Cod will likely spread northwards along the coasts of Greenland and Labrador, occupy larger areas of the Barents Sea, and may even extend onto some of the continental shelves of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, spawning sites will be established further north than currently. It is likely that spring migrations will occur earlier, and fall returns will be later. There is the distinct possibility that, where seasonal sea ice disappears altogether, cod will cease their migration. Individual growth rates for many of the cod stocks will increase, leading to in overall increase in the total production of Atlantic cod in the North Atlantic. These responses of cod to future climate changes are highly uncertain, however, as they will also depend on the changes to climate and oceanographic variables besides temperature, such as plankton production, the prey and predator fields, and industrial fishing.

In commercial fisheries attention is increasingly directed to species historically being of secondary importance and potentially being influenced by these drivers. We present long-term commercial fisheries data of North Sea whiting (Merlangius merlangus), comprising international catches (1903-2010), quotas (1980-2010), and British otter trawler data (landings-per-unit-effort (lpue) for 1923-2009 at the spatial scale of ICES rectangles). Based on lpue data, we tested the possible effects of climate change and fishing pressure on whiting distribution. Results showed no distinct latitudinal and deepening shifts, but a similar to 1 degrees westward shift between the late-1940s and 1960s. Relations to climate change and fishing pressure were not strong. The lack of clear latitudinal and deepening shifts contrasts with recent studies another North Sea species reporting such shifts related to temperature change. The North Sea is at the centre of the distribution range of whiting, and the temperature changes might still fall well within the physiological tolerance limits of this species, hence not affecting the distribution. The drivers for the longitudinal shift remain unclear. However, whiting is also commonly discarded by fisheries; if levels of discarding differ spatially, our results may not represent the true picture of whiting distribution and need to be interpreted with caution. This highlights the challenge in detection and attribution of climate change effects on exploited fish stocks with commercial data only. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The consequence of these changes has been a northward shift of the distribution limits and changes in richness.

This rise was due to an increase in frequency of occurrence and abundance of the majority of fish species in the area (53% from the total species). A fisheries relate explanation was discarded because the mismatch between the changes in the fishing effort and the augment in frequency of occurrence and abundance. On the contrary, these changes are in agreement with expected response under the increasing temperature of the sea observed over the last three decades, associated to global warming. These changes were positively correlated with an increase in temperature of intermediate waters in the study area.

Results showed significant trends in abundance and occurrence for 55% of the flatfish species in the Bay of Biscay. The response to warming of seawater was correlated to geographic ranges of species.

Our major experience by the coupling model subsystems is that well-defined and generic model interfaces are very important for a successful and extendable coupled model framework. The integrated approach, simulating ecosystem dynamics from physics to fish, allows for analysis of the pathways in the ecosystem to investigate the propagation of changes in the ocean climate and to quantify the impacts on the higher trophic level, in this case the sandeel population, demonstrated here on the basis of hindcast data. The coupled forecasting system is tested for some typical scientific questions appearing in spatial fish stock management and marine spatial planning, including determination of local and basin-scale maximum sustainable yield, stock connectivity and source/sink structure.

The new model, called the Non-Parametric Probabilistic Ecological Niche (NPPEN) model, is derived from a test recently applied to compare the ecological niche of 2 different species. The analysis is based on a simplification of the Multiple Response Permutation Procedures (MRPP) using the Generalised Mahalanobis distance. For the first time, we propose to test the generalized Mahalanobis distance by a non-parametric procedure, thus avoiding the arbitrary selection of quantile classes to allow the direct estimation of the probability of occurrence of a species. The model NPPEN was applied to model the ecological niche (sensu Hutchinson) of Atlantic cod and therefore its spatial distribution. The modelled niche exhibited high probabilities of occurrence at bathymetry ranging from 0 to 500 m (mode from 100 to 300 m), at annual sea surface temperature of from -1 to 14 degrees C (mode from 4 to 8 degrees C) and at annual sea surface salinity ranging from 0 to 36 (mode from 25 to 34).

Previous studies project expansion of species range for some species and local extinction elsewhere under climate change. Such range shifts raise concern for species whose long-term persistence is already threatened by other human disturbances such as fishing. However, few studies have attempted to assess the effects of future climate change on threatened vertebrate marine species using a multi-model approach. There has also been a recent surge of interest in climate change impacts on protected areas. This study applies three species distribution models and two sets of climate model projections to explore the potential impacts of climate change on marine species by 2050. A set of species in the North Sea, including seven threatened and ten major commercial species were used as a case study. Changes in habitat suitability in selected candidate protected areas around the UK under future climatic scenarios were assessed for these species. Moreover, change in the degree of overlap between commercial and threatened species ranges was calculated as a proxy of the potential threat posed by overfishing through bycatch.

This study applies three species distribution models and two sets of climate model projections to explore the potential impacts of climate change on marine species by 2050.

Moreover, change in the degree of overlap between commercial and threatened species ranges was calculated as a proxy of the potential threat posed by overfishing through bycatch. The ensemble projections suggest northward shifts in species at an average rate of 27 km per decade, resulting in small average changes in range overlap between threatened and commercially exploited species. Furthermore, the adverse consequences of climate change on the habitat suitability of protected areas were projected to be small.

Most studies explore the current fauna or compare today's situation with that of 2 or 3 decades ago, when North Sea-wide information on benthos and fishing became available. However, in the North Sea, extensive mechanised trawling began more than a century ago. This study compared historical and recent records in order to explore potential long-term links between changes in the epibenthos and fishing. Based on reconstructed species lists from museum specimens, we compared epibenthos data from 1902 to 1912 with those from 1982 to 1985 and 2000. We analysed changes in average taxonomic distinctness (AvTD), a biodiversity indicator, and changes in biogeographical species distributions. Landings data were collated for round- and flatfish caught in the northern, central and southern North Sea from 1906 to 2000 as proxies for total otter and beam trawl effort, respectively. These indicate that the southern and much of the central North Sea were fished intensively throughout the 20th century, whilst the northern North Sea was less exploited, especially in earlier decades; exploitation intensified markedly from the 1960s onwards. For epibenthos, the mean AvTD decreased significantly from the 1980s to 2000, when it was below expected values in 4 ICES rectangles, 3 of these located in heavily trawled areas. Biogeographical changes from the beginning to the end of the century occurred in 27 of 48 taxa. In 14 taxa, spatial presence was reduced by 50% or more, most notably in the southern and central North Sea; often these were long-lived, slow-growing species with vulnerable shells or tests. By contrast, 12 taxa doubled their spatial presence throughout the North Sea. Most biogeographical changes had happened by the 1980s. Given that other important environmental changes, including eutrophication and climate change, have gained importance mainly from the 1980s onwards, we have concluded that the changes in epibenthos observed since the beginning of the 20th century have resulted primarily from intensified fisheries.",English,Article,,,EXCLUDE on target species/stock,CS - North Sea,">100,000",multidecadal,"10,000-50,000",year,Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey,,2,2,3,,,Task 5.2 Predicting species distribution ,Benthic species,,benthic,research survey,Multiple,,,,,,,,,"spatial only: distribution, mapping, static ",visualization/maps,,Yes,"Evidence from this study suggests that fishing is the most probable cause for the changes in benthos because of (1) the nature of the species suffering from declining presence, (2) the area in which most reductions were recorded, (3) the timing of changes in the benthos.

We consider observed changes in calcification rates, demography, abundance, distribution, and phenology of marine species. We draw on a database of observed climate change impacts on marine species, supplemented with evidence in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We discuss factors that limit or facilitate species responses, such as fishing pressure, the availability of prey, habitat, light and other resources, and dispersal by ocean currents. We find that general trends in species' responses are consistent with expectations from climate change, including shifts in distribution to higher latitudes and to deeper locations, advances in spring phenology, declines in calcification, and increases in the abundance of warm-water species. The volume and type of evidence associated with species responses to climate change is variable across ocean regions and taxonomic groups, with predominance of evidence derived from the heavily-studied north Atlantic Ocean. Most investigations of the impact of climate change being associated with the impacts of changing temperature, with few observations of effects of changing oxygen, wave climate, precipitation (coastal waters), or ocean acidification.

Observations of species responses that have been linked to anthropogenic climate change are widespread, but are still lacking for some taxonomic groups (e.g., phytoplankton, benthic invertebrates, marine mammals) and ocean regions (open ocean, tropics). Generally, responses to temperature are well studied, but notable gaps in observations and knowledge include responses to ocean acidification and changing oxygen concentration.","Observed responses of species to climate change across ocean regions show considerable variability both within and between taxonomic groups (Poloczanska et al., 2013). Species responses are complex and likely tempered by ecological characteristics, trophic interactions and resource availability, as well as other anthropogenic stressors, such as pollution and fishing. Fishing is a pervasive stressor in marine ecosystems (Worm et al., 2009; Branch et al., 2010) and its effects appear to increase sensitivities of ecological responses to climate change (Hsieh et al., 2008; Rijnsdorp et al., 2009; Hermant et al., 2010; Bates et al., 2014a).

Ocean acidification will challenge marine calcifiers to grow and maintain their tests, shells and skeletons made from calcium carbonate. Experimental studies generally show negative responses of heterotrophs and calcified autotrophs to acidification, although results are highly variable and, of concern, show a trend overall toward enhanced sensitivity when thermal stress increases (Harvey et al., 2013; Kroeker et al., 2013; Nagelkerken and Connell, 2015). 

Climate change will influence the demographics of marine species through differential effects on reproduction, growth and survival thus species abundance and population growth. Hypotheses regarding the response of populations to climate change include declines in recruitment/breeding success for populations near the equatorward edges of their ranges as temperatures warm, and corresponding increases near the poleward edges, although these will be tempered by a range of biotic and abiotic factors and differences in individual physiological responses (Poloczanska et al., 2013). 

Abundance changes were among the most commonly reported responses in MCID (41%). In a warming ocean, warm-water species are expected to increase and cold-water species decline. In MCID, species were classified as warm, cold or cosmopolitan relative to the region in which they were studied. Fifty-two percent of species classified as warm-water increased in abundance and 52% of cold-water species declined consistent with expectations under climate change; the remainder either showing no change or equivocal changes in abundance. Of the cosmopolitan species, there was no bias in either direction with an equal number (39%) increasing and decreasing in abundance, with the remaining 22% showing no change.

Shifts in species distributions in relation to climate change are widely-reported (41% of MCID) with observational evidence from leading (polewards) and trailing (equatorwards) edges of species' distributions and from measurements at the centers of species distributions.

Seasons in the ocean are changing (Stine et al., 2009; Burrows et al., 2011), but observations of changes in marine phenology are relatively rare compared to those on land (Parmesan, 2007; Chambers et al., 2013), only 14% of MCID are phenology observations.

Generally, responses to temperature are well studied, but notable gaps in observations and knowledge include responses to ocean acidification and changing oxygen concentration.","Observed responses of species to climate change across ocean regions show considerable variability both within and between taxonomic groups (Poloczanska et al., 2013). Species responses are complex and likely tempered by ecological characteristics, trophic interactions and resource availability, as well as other anthropogenic stressors, such as pollution and fishing. Fishing is a pervasive stressor in marine ecosystems (Worm et al., 2009; Branch et al., 2010) and its effects appear to increase sensitivities of ecological responses to climate change (Hsieh et al., 2008; Rijnsdorp et al., 2009; Hermant et al., 2010; Bates et al., 2014a).

Ocean acidification will challenge marine calcifiers to grow and maintain their tests, shells and skeletons made from calcium carbonate. Experimental studies generally show negative responses of heterotrophs and calcified autotrophs to acidification, although results are highly variable and, of concern, show a trend overall toward enhanced sensitivity when thermal stress increases (Harvey et al., 2013; Kroeker et al., 2013; Nagelkerken and Connell, 2015). 

Climate change will influence the demographics of marine species through differential effects on reproduction, growth and survival thus species abundance and population growth. Hypotheses regarding the response of populations to climate change include declines in recruitment/breeding success for populations near the equatorward edges of their ranges as temperatures warm, and corresponding increases near the poleward edges, although these will be tempered by a range of biotic and abiotic factors and differences in individual physiological responses (Poloczanska et al., 2013). 

Abundance changes were among the most commonly reported responses in MCID (41%). In a warming ocean, warm-water species are expected to increase and cold-water species decline. In MCID, species were classified as warm, cold or cosmopolitan relative to the region in which they were studied. Fifty-two percent of species classified as warm-water increased in abundance and 52% of cold-water species declined consistent with expectations under climate change; the remainder either showing no change or equivocal changes in abundance. Of the cosmopolitan species, there was no bias in either direction with an equal number (39%) increasing and decreasing in abundance, with the remaining 22% showing no change.

Shifts in species distributions in relation to climate change are widely-reported (41% of MCID) with observational evidence from leading (polewards) and trailing (equatorwards) edges of species' distributions and from measurements at the centers of species distributions.

Seasons in the ocean are changing (Stine et al., 2009; Burrows et al., 2011), but observations of changes in marine phenology are relatively rare compared to those on land (Parmesan, 2007; Chambers et al., 2013), only 14% of MCID are phenology observations.

Generally, responses to temperature are well studied, but notable gaps in observations and knowledge include responses to ocean acidification and changing oxygen concentration.","Observed responses of species to climate change across ocean regions show considerable variability both within and between taxonomic groups (Poloczanska et al., 2013). Species responses are complex and likely tempered by ecological characteristics, trophic interactions and resource availability, as well as other anthropogenic stressors, such as pollution and fishing. Fishing is a pervasive stressor in marine ecosystems (Worm et al., 2009; Branch et al., 2010) and its effects appear to increase sensitivities of ecological responses to climate change (Hsieh et al., 2008; Rijnsdorp et al., 2009; Hermant et al., 2010; Bates et al., 2014a).

Ocean acidification will challenge marine calcifiers to grow and maintain their tests, shells and skeletons made from calcium carbonate. Experimental studies generally show negative responses of heterotrophs and calcified autotrophs to acidification, although results are highly variable and, of concern, show a trend overall toward enhanced sensitivity when thermal stress increases (Harvey et al., 2013; Kroeker et al., 2013; Nagelkerken and Connell, 2015). 

Climate change will influence the demographics of marine species through differential effects on reproduction, growth and survival thus species abundance and population growth. Hypotheses regarding the response of populations to climate change include declines in recruitment/breeding success for populations near the equatorward edges of their ranges as temperatures warm, and corresponding increases near the poleward edges, although these will be tempered by a range of biotic and abiotic factors and differences in individual physiological responses (Poloczanska et al., 2013). 

Abundance changes were among the most commonly reported responses in MCID (41%). In a warming ocean, warm-water species are expected to increase and cold-water species decline. In MCID, species were classified as warm, cold or cosmopolitan relative to the region in which they were studied. Fifty-two percent of species classified as warm-water increased in abundance and 52% of cold-water species declined consistent with expectations under climate change; the remainder either showing no change or equivocal changes in abundance. Of the cosmopolitan species, there was no bias in either direction with an equal number (39%) increasing and decreasing in abundance, with the remaining 22% showing no change.

Shifts in species distributions in relation to climate change are widely-reported (41% of MCID) with observational evidence from leading (polewards) and trailing (equatorwards) edges of species' distributions and from measurements at the centers of species distributions.

Seasons in the ocean are changing (Stine et al., 2009; Burrows et al., 2011), but observations of changes in marine phenology are relatively rare compared to those on land (Parmesan, 2007; Chambers et al., 2013), only 14% of MCID are phenology observations.

Observations of species responses that have been linked to anthropogenic climate change are widespread, but are still lacking for some taxonomic groups (e.g., phytoplankton, benthic invertebrates, marine mammals) and ocean regions (open ocean, tropics). Generally, responses to temperature are well studied, but notable gaps in observations and knowledge include responses to ocean acidification and changing oxygen concentration.","Observed responses of species to climate change across ocean regions show considerable variability both within and between taxonomic groups (Poloczanska et al., 2013). Species responses are complex and likely tempered by ecological characteristics, trophic interactions and resource availability, as well as other anthropogenic stressors, such as pollution and fishing. Fishing is a pervasive stressor in marine ecosystems (Worm et al., 2009; Branch et al., 2010) and its effects appear to increase sensitivities of ecological responses to climate change (Hsieh et al., 2008; Rijnsdorp et al., 2009; Hermant et al., 2010; Bates et al., 2014a).

Ocean acidification will challenge marine calcifiers to grow and maintain their tests, shells and skeletons made from calcium carbonate. Experimental studies generally show negative responses of heterotrophs and calcified autotrophs to acidification, although results are highly variable and, of concern, show a trend overall toward enhanced sensitivity when thermal stress increases (Harvey et al., 2013; Kroeker et al., 2013; Nagelkerken and Connell, 2015). 

Climate change will influence the demographics of marine species through differential effects on reproduction, growth and survival thus species abundance and population growth. Hypotheses regarding the response of populations to climate change include declines in recruitment/breeding success for populations near the equatorward edges of their ranges as temperatures warm, and corresponding increases near the poleward edges, although these will be tempered by a range of biotic and abiotic factors and differences in individual physiological responses (Poloczanska et al., 2013). 

Abundance changes were among the most commonly reported responses in MCID (41%). In a warming ocean, warm-water species are expected to increase and cold-water species decline. In MCID, species were classified as warm, cold or cosmopolitan relative to the region in which they were studied. Fifty-two percent of species classified as warm-water increased in abundance and 52% of cold-water species declined consistent with expectations under climate change; the remainder either showing no change or equivocal changes in abundance. Of the cosmopolitan species, there was no bias in either direction with an equal number (39%) increasing and decreasing in abundance, with the remaining 22% showing no change.

Shifts in species distributions in relation to climate change are widely-reported (41% of MCID) with observational evidence from leading (polewards) and trailing (equatorwards) edges of species' distributions and from measurements at the centers of species distributions.

Seasons in the ocean are changing (Stine et al., 2009; Burrows et al., 2011), but observations of changes in marine phenology are relatively rare compared to those on land (Parmesan, 2007; Chambers et al., 2013), only 14% of MCID are phenology observations.

The abiotic environment has a large effect on species spatial distribution patterns and productivity and, consequently, spatial co-occurrence between predators and prey, while fishing alters species abundances and food-web structure. In order to disentangle the impacts of the abiotic environment and fishing in the Celtic Sea ecosystem, we developed a spatio-temporal trophic model, specifically an Ecopath with Ecosim with Ecospace model, for the period 1985-2016. In this model, particular attention was paid to the parameterization of the responses of all trophic levels to abiotic environmental changes. Satellite remote sensing data were employed to determine the spatial distribution and annual fluctuations of primary production (PP). Spatial and temporal changes in the habitat favorable for zooplankton were predicted with a novel ecological-niche approach using daily detection of productivity fronts from satellite ocean color. Finally, functional responses characterizing the effect of several abiotic environmental variables (including, among others, temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen concentration, both at the surface and at the bottom) on fish species groups' habitat suitability were produced from the predictions of statistical habitat models fitted to presence-absence data collected by multiple fisheries-independent surveys. The dynamic component of our model (Ecosim) was driven by time-series of fishing effort, PP, zooplankton habitat suitability and abiotic environmental variables, and was fitted to abundance and fisheries catch data. The spatial component of our model (Ecospace) was constructed, for specific years of the period 1985-2016 with contrasted abiotic environmental conditions, to predict the variable distribution of the biomass of all functional groups. We found that fishing was the main driver of observed ecosystem changes in the Celtic Sea over the period 1985-2016. However, the integration of the environmental variability into the model and the subsequent improvement of the fit of the dynamic Ecosim component highlighted (i) the control of the overall pelagic production by PP and (ii) the influence of temperature on the productivity of several trophic levels in the Celtic Sea, especially on trophic groups with warm and cold water affinities. In addition, Ecospace predictions indicated that the spatial distributions of commercial fish species may have substantially changed over the studied period. These spatial changes mainly appeared to be driven by temperature and may, therefore, largely impact future fisheries given the continuity of climatic changes.",English,Article,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",Web of Science,K,CS - Western Waters,">100,000",multidecadal,"50,000-100,000",year,Simulated dynamics,,3,3,3,,,"Task 5.4.

Fish landings from the Baltic and North Sea are shown to be taken from a lower trophic level and are shown to be overall more planktivorous than those from shelf edge regions. The secondary production required per unit of landed fish from the North Sea was approximately half that for landings from the southwest approaches to the UK, referred to as the Celtic Seas, where zooplankton production accounted for only a small fraction of the secondary production demands of the fisheries. In the North Sea, variability in zooplankton production seems to have exerted a bottom-up effect on fish production, which in turn has exerted a top-down effect on the benthos. Conversely, Celtic Seas benthos production has been a bottom-up driver of fish production, which seems to have been independent of variability in plankton production. Thus, climate and fishing pressures call be expected to influence these regional fisheries in very different ways. Overall, the results indicate very strong spatial patterns in the fish foodweb structure and function, which will be important considerations in the establishment of regional management plans for fisheries.

This paper firstly presents a VMS-based reconstruction of the fishing effort and of the area of activity of the Italian trawlers in the Mediterranean Sea. The fishing area of each fleet is then used as a spatial reference to estimate primary productivity rate and gross primary production and to investigate, by using General Additive Models, the effects of trawling effort, primary production and time on fisheries yield, fisheries productivity and overexploitation rate for some key demersal species. The results evidence that the usage of satellite-based information of fishing activities and of primary production, when combined at the real spatial scale of fishing activities, could effectively improve our ability to analyze the response of the ecosystems to these driving forces and allow capturing the main trends of yield, productivity and overexploitation rate of demersal stocks.",English,Article,,Web of Science,K,CS - Mediterranean,">100,000",decade,"1,000-5,000",subday,Fisheries Dependent Data,GAM,3,3,2,The relationship between gross primary production and landings of demersal species has an asymptotic shape_[…] the wide area exploited by trawlers supports an important gross primary production,,Task 5.3 Predicting changes in fisheries distribution ,Various,unknown,demersal,Commercial,Demersal trawls,Otter trawl,Environmental,fishing effort/pressure/footprint,Fishing,Yes,fishing effort/footprint,Positive,not clear,"spatiotemporal: dynamic, movement, allocation, shift, migration, displacement (e.g. by depth)",regression analysis,"GAM based on spatial fishing effort (VMS & AIS) data, as well as primary productivity",No,

management tools to safeguard the decline of coastal fishing resources. Still, conclusive
evidence of their functioning is lacking, amongst others due to the influence of spatio-temporal
variations in fish populations and habitat heterogeneity which could hamper a sound
data interpretation. We conducted a spatial analysis of the benefits of the Medes Island
Marine Reserve by combining geostatistical and Geographic Information System (GIS) tools.
Concurrently, we analysed effects of trends reflecting habitat heterogeneity and spatial
structuring of data on spatial predictions of fish catch per unit effort (CPUE) and length. Predicted
spatial patterns showed the complexity and simultaneous action of trend factors
leading to mostly non-linear gradients in CPUE and length data. CPUE of total fish and CPUE
and length of common pandora (Pagellus erythrinus) increased close to the Integral Reserve
due to direct and indirect reserve effects. CPUE and length of striped red mullet (Mullus surmuletus)
slightly increased also near the Integral Reserve, but distinct reserve effects could
not be identified due to the strong influence of artificial reefs. We conclude that the spatial
dimension of the Buffer Zone, where artisanal fisheries are allowed, permits in general protection
only for target species, favouring a habitat with no discontinuities from the reserve
outwards. Our spatial approach to assess reserve benefits provides major insights into
complex systems like coastal marine reserves in the northwestern Mediterranean. In addition,

However, analyses dedicated to assess the spatial distribution variability among several canyons are rare. In the northwestern Mediterranean Sea, three major submarine canyons consecutively indent the narrow margin. There, the abundance of deep-sea blue and red shrimp Aristeus antennatus (Crustacea: Decapoda), one of the most important fishery-targeted species in the western and central Mediterranean Sea, sustains relatively high incomes for the nearest fishing harbors. To date, the spatial distribution of this shrimp species has only been assessed on known fishing grounds, but it has neither been modeled simultaneously covering several submarine canyons nor according to the environmental conditions. In this study, we aimed to look over the spatiotemporal shrimp distribution in a region of the northwestern Mediterranean Sea with a particular interest in variations in the three submarine canyons. From summer landing data between 2005 and 2014, we implemented a species distribution model with georeferenced catches linked to environmental data of the shrimp habitats. The model showed that the bottom topography was one of the most essential variables to explain the spatial distribution of the catches and that the highest catch rates were between 475 m and 575 m depth. Overall, two canyons (Blanes and Palamos) sheltered high estimates of catches on the shallow and narrow part of their margins (at 510 and 565 m depth).

This period was preceded by an episodic increase in the rainfall over the Baltic Sea Watershed area. Several climate models, both global and regional, project an increase in the runoff of the Northern latitudes due to proceeding climate change. The aim of this study is to model, firstly, the effects on Baltic Sea salinity of increased runoff due to projected global change and, secondly, the effects of salinity change on the distribution of marine species. The results suggest a critical shift in the S range 5-7, which is a threshold for both freshwater and marine species distributions and diversity. We discuss several topics emphasizing future monitoring, modelling, and fisheries research. Environmental monitoring and modelling are investigated because the developing alternative ecosystems do not necessarily show the same relations to environment quality factors as the retiring ones. An important corollary is that the observed and modelled S changes considered together with species' ranges indicate what may appear under a future climate. Consequences could include a shift in distribution areas of marine benthic foundation species and some 40-50 other species, affiliated to these. This change would extend over hundreds of kilometres, in the Baltic Sea and the adjacent North Sea areas. Potential cascading effects, in coastal ecology, fish ecology and fisheries would be extensive, and point out the necessity to develop further the ecosystem approach in the environmental monitoring.

Almost none were recorded for a total of 70 years between 1925 and 1995. Then, starting in January 1995, red mullet began to appear in numbers to the west and east of Scotland. The exception to the almost total absence for 7 decades is a small peak in numbers, centred on the late 1940s when 19 red mullet were recorded in the Fisheries Research Services' (FRS) demersal sampling area 'Buchan' from a total of 329 trawl hauls. Interestingly, all the red mullet caught by FRS since 1995 have been taken during the first quarter of the year despite active sampling in quarter 3. This observation is puzzling. In an attempt to explain it, the authors postulate that the red mullet entering the northern North Sea in quarter I are in reality part of an increasing southern North Sea population that migrates northwards where water temperatures are higher during wintertime.

One possibility is that the red mullet migrate into the northern North Sea from the southern North Sea during winter to escape lower temperatures. This is because the North Sea is warmer in the north during wintertime than it is in the south due to the influence of the North Atlantic current."

The modelling approach allowed the development of high resolution predictive maps of abundance of four skate and ray species targeted by fishing activity: thornback, spotted, cuckoo and blonde rays. The distributions of these species were driven by a general preference for sand and coarser substrates as well as higher salinities, temperatures and currents speeds. Spatial comparisons between abundance distributions and locations of skate and ray commercial landings indicated that the main hotspots for the investigated species are outside of the main commercial fishing areas and overlap with potential MPAs proposed for wider ecosystem protection. The method offers a useful tool for selecting potential MPA's to assist the management and conservation of data-poor species. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

For instance, unobserved diversity can lead to overestimation of maximum sustainable yields and therefore to overharvesting of the more vulnerable stock components within unrecognized mixed-stock fisheries. We used DNA from archival (otolith) samples to reconstruct the temporal (1976-2011) genetic makeup of two mixed-stock flounder fisheries in the angstrom land Sea (AS) and the Gulf of Finland (GoF). Both fisheries have hitherto been managed as a single stock of European flounders (Platichthys flesus), but were recently revealed to target two closely related species: the pelagic-spawning P. flesus and the newly described, demersal-spawning P. solemdali. While the AS and GoF fisheries were assumed to consist exclusively of P. solemdali, P. flesus dominated the GoF flounder assemblage (87% of total) in 1983, had disappeared (0%) by 1993, and remained in low proportions (10%-11%) thereafter. In the AS, P. solemdali dominated throughout the sampling period (>70%), and P. flesus remained in very low proportions after 1983. The disappearance of P. flesus from the GoF coincides in time with a dramatic (similar to 60%) decline in commercial landings and worsening environmental conditions in P. flesus' northernmost spawning ground, the Eastern Gotland Basin, in the preceding 4-6 years. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that P. flesus in the GoF is a sink population relying on larval subsidies from southern spawning grounds and the cause of their disappearance is a cessation of larval supply.

There was a positive relationship between the proportion of Platichthys flesus in the Gulf of Finland and the reproductive volume in the Eastern Gotland Basin in May–June, while there was no relationship between reproductive volume and the proportion of P. flesus in the Åland Sea.

The combined pressures of fishing activity and climate change have also made it a hotspot of global change amidst increasing concern about the worsening status of exploited marine species. To anticipate the impacts of global changes in the Mediterranean Sea, more integrated modelling approaches are needed, which can then help policymakers prioritize management actions and formulate strategies to mitigate impacts and adapt to changes. The aim of this study was to develop a holistic model of marine biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea with an explicit representation of the spatial, multispecies dynamics of exploited resources subject to the combined influence of climate variability and fishing pressure. To this end, we used the individual-based OSMOSE model (Object-oriented Simulator of Marine ecOSystEms), including 100 marine species (fish, cephalopods and crustaceans) representing about 95% of the total declared catch, at a high spatial resolution (400 km(2)) and a large spatial scale (the entire Mediterranean basin) - the first time such a resolution and scale have been modelled. We then combined OSMOSE with the NEMOMED 12 physical model and the Eco3M-S biogeochemical low trophic level model to build the end-to-end model, OSMOSE-MED. We fitted OSMOSE-MED model with observed or estimated biomass and commercial catch data using a likelihood approach and an evolutionary optimization algorithm. The outputs of OSMOSE-MED were then verified against observed biomass and catch data, and compared with independent datasets (MEDITS data, diet composition and trophic levels). The model results - at different hierarchical levels, from individuals to the scale of the ecosystem - were consistent with current knowledge of the structure, functioning and dynamics of the ecosystems in the Mediterranean Sea. While the model could be further improved in future iterations, all the modelling steps - the comprehensive representation of key ecological processes and feedback, the selective parameterization of the model, and the comparison with observed data in the validation process - strengthened the predictive performance of OSMOSE-MED and thus its relevance as an impact model to explore the future of marine biodiversity under scenarios of global change.

Skewed sex ratios with a predominance of males were observed in the survey catches of 2- and 3-year-old cod taken on the spawning grounds. In contrast, commercial midwater trawl catches of cod in the same area had consistently higher sex ratios, suggesting that mature males and females have different vertical migration behaviour. Estimates of proportion mature were not affected by method of capture. In a GLM analysis, the factor age explained most of the variation in maturity in each sex, whilst length, although a significant factor, explained less variation than year and region (spawning and non-spawning grounds). Maturity was observed in a variable proportion of 2-year-olds, whilst virtually no 1-year-olds and all 3-year-olds and older were mature irrespective of area or year of capture. Population estimates of proportion mature in 2-year-olds, from all years' data combined, were 0.87 in males and 0.45 in females. Estimates were higher in spawning areas than in non-spawning areas, and showed a general increase over time throughout the survey area. However, in any year, the proportion mature at age 2 varied little with length and was reduced only in the smallest fish (<40 cm) at this age in some years. The increase over time in proportion mature coincided with rising sea surface temperature (SST) and a decline in recruitment and stock biomass at high rates of fishing mortality. Mean length-at-age differed consistently between year classes, the differences being largely established in the first year of life. The fastest growth rates were apparent in very weak year classes produced in the late 1990s when SST was relatively high. The interrelationships between growth, maturity, SST and abundance are examined, and changes in growth and maturity since earlier studies in the 1970s are investigated.

The distribution pattern of reported recaptured M. asterias ( return-rate 3.6%, n= 80) showed a circannual migration between summering in the southern North Sea and wintering in the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay, and suggests that M. asterias is philopatric. The Dutch angling season for M. asterias runs from approximately mid-May to mid-October when the water temperature is above 13 degrees C. Recaptures of eight mature females, but no males in the Bay of Biscay, indicate partial spatial segregation by sex, where mature females migrate over larger distances than immature females and males. These observations, with the absence of recaptures in other known summering areas ( i.e. the Irish Sea and Bristol Channel), suggest that the southern North Sea is used by a separate population.

Our analysis reveals pronounced net fluxes between areas, indicative of source sink dynamics, as well as area-specific differences in species interactions (i.e., density dependence, competition, and predator prey) and the degree of fishing and climate impact on survival and recruitment. Furthermore, model simulations show that decreasing exploitation pressure in the source area for cod (without reallocating fishing effort) produces an increase in neighboring sink habitats, but a decline of prey species in response to increased predation. Our approach provides valuable insight concerning metacommunity-structuring of marine fish and may serve as an important tool for implementing sustainable management strategies under the ecosystem approach to marine and fisheries management.",English,Article,,Web of Science,K,CS - Baltic Sea,">100,000",multidecadal,">100,000",year,Simulated dynamics,multivariate autoregressive (MAR) model,2,2,3," As illustrated by our management simulation, efforts to decrease exploitation in the source

Individual growth rates reflect the unique exposure of each larva to the environment along its drift trajectory. In this context, the environment refers to a wide range of factors affecting growth such as food, turbulence and temperature. A combination of a model of egg production by the adult stock, a particle-tracking scheme, and a model of larval growth and mortality rate was used to simulate the dispersal trajectories, and the survival of haddock larvae spawned at different times and locations on the continental shelf. The particle tracking was driven by flowfields from a climatological implementation of the Hamburg Shelf-Ocean Model (HAMSOM) for the North Sea and NE Atlantic.

A series of low recruitments with a persistently high level of fishing has been blamed, raising concerns about the processes involved in seabass reproduction and settlement in nurseries. Here, we characterise seabass spawning areas along the French Atlantic coast using vessel monitoring system (VMS) data. A non-linear geostatistical approach was applied, from 2008 to 2014, to detect locations where seabass aggregate for spawning. Occurrence maps of spawning distribution were combined into probability maps to quantify the seasonal and inter-annual variability and to highlight recurrent, occasional and unfavourable spawning areas.

The preferential spawning habitats of these species were modelled using generalised linear models, with egg distribution being used as proxy of spawners' location. Egg spatial and temporal distributions were explored based on six environmental variables: sea surface temperature and salinity, chlorophyll a concentration, depth, bedstress and seabed sediment types. In most cases, egg density was found to be strongly related to these environmental variables. Egg densities were positively correlated with shallow to intermediate depths having low temperature and relatively high salinity.

The goal of this exercise was to predict the drift trajectories of cod larvae in the Bornholm Basin, thereby aiding in the development of future sampling programs as well as the identification of processes influencing larval retention/dispersion in the Bornholm Basin. Distributions of variables (T,S and larval distribution) were obtained utilizing a three-dimensional eddy-resolving baroclinic model of the Baltic Sea based on the Bryan-Cox-Semtner code. Larval drift was simulated by the incorporation of a passive tracer into the model utilized to represent individual cod larvae. Additionally, simulated Lagrangian drift trajectories are presented. For model purposes, initial fields of temperature, salinity and cod larvae concentration for the Bornholm Basin were constructed by objective analysis using observations taken during a research survey in early July, 1994. Outside the Bornholm Basin generalized hydrographic features of the Baltic Sea were utilized with the baroclinic model forced by wind data for the whole Baltic taken from the Europa-Modell (EM) of the German weather service, Offenbach. Verification of simulations was performed by comparison with field measurements of hydrographic variables and ADCP derived current measurements taken during the surveys. In general, most of the hydrographic features observed during the second research cruise are correctly simulated, with variations mainly attributed to the prescribed initial conditions outside the Bornholm Basin. Results from larval sampling during the second cruise could not entirely confirm the modeled larval distributions due to the low numbers of larvae captured. However, the modeled results based on the agreement of the flow fields and hydrographic properties with observed features suggest that predictions of larval distributions can be made with a high degree of confidence if appropriate larval behaviours are included in the simulations.

The reconstruction of the sparse source-sink linkage pattern, that is, to identify which sources contribute to which regions in the sink, is a challenging task in marine ecology. We derive a constrained nonlinear multicomponent regression model for source-sink reconstruction, which is capable of simultaneously selecting important linkages from the sources to the sink regions and making inference about the unobserved spawning activities at the sources. Asparsity-inducing and nonnegativity-constrained regularization approach is developed for model estimation, and theoretically we show that our estimator enjoys the oracle properties.

In this study, generalized additive models were used to predict the spawning habitat of North Sea cod, based on the abundance of spawning fish within three population subareas and nine environmental layers. The length of spawning cod differed among population subareas, consistent with published evidence of maturation differences. In the northeast North Sea (Viking), the peak in the spawning season was estimated to occur after the survey which made the prediction of spawning grounds for this area less certain. Cod were found to prefer areas with temperatures around 5-7 degrees C for spawning and there was a general preference for high salinity waters. Persistence of cod spawning grounds over the study period was related to interannual stability in temperature, with high variability in the use of Southern Bight spawning grounds. As such, cod appear to minimize interannual variability in the initial environmental conditions affecting offspring survival by selecting suitable cold spawning grounds. Seabed conditions also affected spawning distribution with cod selecting coarse sand and avoiding areas of very high tidal flow. The model prediction was compared with the distribution of cod aggregations during the spawning season reported by fishing boats. Seventy per cent of the aggregations was located in areas classified as occasional or recurrent spawning grounds. The predicted distribution confirmed the widespread occurrence of spawning in the North Sea and showed good agreement with recent and past studies of cod egg distribution, suggesting that nearly all major historical areas of spawning still appear in use today.

Recent studies taking into account both taxonomic and trait diversity have revealed that the two biodiversity components may exhibit pronounced temporal and spatial differences. These apparent incongruences indicate that the two components may respond differently to environmental drivers and that changes in one component might not affect the other. Such incongruences may provide insight into the structuring of communities through community assembly processes, and the resilience of ecosystems to change. Here we examine temporal and spatial patterns and drivers of multiple marine biodiversity indicators using the North Sea fish community as a case study. Based on long-term spatially resolved survey data on fish species occurrences and bio-masses from 1983 to 2014 and an extensive trait dataset we: (i) investigate temporal and spatial incongruences between taxonomy and trait-based indicators of both richness and evenness; (ii) examine the underlying environmental drivers and, (iii) interpret the results in the context of assembly rules acting on community composition.

Atlantic cod Gadus morhua L. was over exploited in the sea areas around the British Isles in the last century and is struggling to recover. There is an urgent need to define the biological stock structure to improve management. In this study, we used data recovered from temperature and depth loggers attached to 252 Atlantic cod to infer and map their movements around the British Isles. Individual cod showed a range of behaviours including migration, site fidelity and limited home ranging. We estimated home ranges and seasonal movements and test predictions based on data from population genetics. Cod from a northern offshore area in the North Sea did not mix with cod from the central and southern North Sea, which in turn did not mix with those from western areas (the Celtic and Irish Seas). Cod experienced average monthly temperatures between 6 and 17 degrees C and occupied average depths between 15 and 165m. Cod that occupied the deeper northern offshore area lived in colder and less variable waters than elsewhere. Differences in thermal experience are likely to underpin variation in physiology and growth rate that will have implications for how the species responds to climate change. This study provides evidence that cod living around the British Isles are comprised of at least one more distinct population unit that is currently recognized for stock management purposes.

While tactical management is still dominated by single-species models that do not explicitly account for these drivers, more holistic ecosystem models are used in strategic management. One way forward in this regard is with individual-based models (IBMs), which provide a single framework in which these drivers can be represented explicitly. We present a generic marine fish IBM that incorporates spatial and temporal variation in food availability, temperature and exploitation. Key features of the model are that it (1) includes realistic energy budgets; (2) includes the full life cycle of fish; (3) is spatially-explicit and (4) incorporates satellite remote-sensing data to represent the environmental drivers. The rates at which individuals acquire and use energy depend on local food availability and temperature. Their state variables, including life stage, size and energy reserves, are updated daily, from which population structure and dynamics emerge. To demonstrate the use of the model we calibrate it for mackerel (Scomber scombrus) in the North East Atlantic. Most parameters are taken from the literature, except the background early mortality rate and the strength predator density dependence, which were estimated by fitting the model to data using Approximate Bayesian Computation. The calibrated model successfully matches the available data on mackerel population dynamics and structure. We demonstrate the use of the model for management purposes by simulating the population effects of opening and closing a sector of the North Sea to mackerel fishing. Our model uses basic principles of behavioural and physiological ecology to establish how spatial and temporal variations in ecosystem drivers affect the individuals in the population. Population dynamics and structure are calculated from the collective effects on individuals. Application to a test case shows the method can fit available data well. Individual-based approaches such as this study have potential for use in strategic management because they can account for spatial structuring, food-web interactions, density dependence, and environmental drivers within a single framework.",English,Article,,Web of Science,K,CS - North Sea,">100,000",decade,"10,000-50,000",month,Simulated dynamics,Individual Based Model,2,2,3,"Through an IBM model basic principles of behavioural and physiological ecology were used to establish how spatial and temporal variations in ecosystem drivers affect the individuals in the population.We demonstrate the use of the model for management purposes by simulating

Distribution patterns, habitat use, and aggregative behaviour often vary throughout the life cycle and can increase the vulnerability of certain life stages to anthropogenic impacts. Here we investigate distribution changes during the life cycle of whiting (Merlangius merlangus) to the west of the UK. Density distributions for age-0, age-1 and mature fish were modelled as functions of environmental variables using generalised additive mixed effects models. The greatest densities of age-0 whiting occurred over finer sediments where temperatures were between 12 to 13 degrees C. Age-0 whiting densities decreased with increasing depth. Higher densities of age-1 whiting were also associated with fine sediments and peaked at 60 m, but this influence was also dependent on proximity to shore. Mature fish, while showing no association with any particular sediment type, were strongly associated with depths >60 m. Geostatistical aggregation curves were used to classify space use and showed persistent aggregations of age-0 whiting occupying inshore waters while age-1 and mature fish were more dispersed and differed among years. The differences in distributions among life stages suggested a general coastal to offshore shift as cohorts developed with mature whiting mainly occupying deep offshore waters. The spatial dynamics and areas of persistent life stage aggregation identified here could enable informed targeting and avoidance of specific age-class whiting to aid bycatch reduction.

Although overfishing is the main cause of most observed declines, this study shows that in some regions, climate by its influence on plankton may exert a strong control on cod stocks, complicating the management of this species that often assumes a constant carrying capacity. First, we investigate the likely drivers of changes in the cod stock in the North Sea by evaluating the potential relationships between climate, plankton and cod. We do this by deriving a Plankton Index that reflects the quality and quantity of plankton food available for larval cod. We show that this Plankton Index explains 46.24% of the total variance in cod recruitment and 68.89% of the variance in total cod biomass. Because the effects of climate act predominantly through plankton during the larval stage of cod development, our results indicate a pronounced sensitivity of cod stocks to climate at the warmer, southern edge of their distribution, for example in the North Sea. Our analyses also reveal for the first time, that at a large basin scale, the abundance of Calanus finmarchicus is associated with a high probability of cod occurrence, whereas the genus Pseudocalanus appears less important. Ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) generally considers the effect of fishing on the ecosystem and not the effect of climate-induced changes in the ecosystem state for the living resources.

This article examines long-term changes in the distribution and occurrence of the elasmobranch assemblage of the southern North Sea, based on extensive historical time series (1902-2013) of fishery-independent survey data. In general, larger species (thornback ray, tope, spurdog) exhibited long-term declines, and the largest (common skate complex) became locally extirpated (as did angelshark). Smaller species increased (spotted and starry ray, lesser-spotted dogfish) as did smooth-hound, likely benefiting from greater resilience to fishing and/or climate change. This indicates a fundamental shift from historical dominance of larger, commercially valuable species to current prevalence of smaller, more productive species often of low commercial value. In recent years, however, some trends have reversed, with the (cold-water associated) starry ray now declining and thornback ray increasing. This shift may be attributed to (i) fishing, including mechanised beam trawling introduced in the 1960s-1970s, and historical target fisheries for elasmobranchs; (ii) climate change, currently favouring warm-water above cold-water species; and (iii) habitat loss, including potential degradation of coastal and outer estuarine nursery habitats.

The transport patterns of the larvae spawned at the three major spawning grounds in the central Baltic Sea were investigated by drift model simulations for the period 1979-2004. We analysed potential habitats for their suitability for juvenile settlement, i.e. the change from pelagic to demersal life. The results revealed a clear dependence of the probability for successful settling on wind-induced drift of larval cod, which is controlled by the local atmospheric conditions over the Baltic Sea. Furthermore, we found evidence that the final destinations of juvenile cod drift routes are affected by decadal climate variability.

The historical series of autumn bottom trawl surveys carried out in Galicia and Cantabrian Sea waters from 1983 show that the processes of hake recruitment lead to well-defined patches of juveniles, found in localized areas of the continental shelf. These concentrations vary in density according to the strength of the year-class, although they remain generally stable in size and spatial location. The size of the patches, estimated using basic geostatistical techniques, is found to be from 20 to 35 km in diameter. The existence of spatial correlation is assumed by computing variograms, and the year-on-year repetition of the spatial patterns is shown to be a way of linking them to environmental conditions.

In the eastern, progressively narrowing, shelf of the Cantabrian Sea, years of massive inflow of the eastward shelf-edge current produce low recruitment indices, due to larvae and pre-recruits being transported away from spawning areas to the open ocean. Under these conditions, high mortality is expected because of the difficulties juveniles have in finding the shelf grounds. On the other hand, the transport of larvae within anticyclonic mesoscale structures moving towards the recruitment areas will be an aid to recruitment. These eddies displace westward according to the condition of potential vorticity conservation. When orographic features, such as big capes, occur in their drift path their eastern edges are held back. This situation causes patches of recruits to be located east of the main capes of the western Cantabrian Sea.

The pattern of feeding of juvenile hake includes vertical migrations searching for small pelagic fish. Upward motions of nutrient-rich deeper water masses were found close to the recruitment areas, stemming from variations of the vorticity field by mesoscale eddies.

The ENM was built combining knowledge on biological traits of hake recruits (e.g. growth, settlement, mobility and feeding strategy) with patterns of selected ecological variables (chlorophyll-a fronts and concentration, bottom depth, sea bottom current and temperature) to highlight favourable nursery habitats. The results show that hake nurseries require stable bottom temperature (11.8-15.0 degrees C), low bottom currents (<0.034 m s(-1)) and a frequent occurrence of productive fronts in low chlorophyll-a areas (0.1-0.9 mg m(-3)) to support a successful recruitment. These conditions mostly occur recurrently in outer shelf and shelf break areas. The prediction explains the relative balance between biotic and abiotic drivers of hake recruitment in the Mediterranean Sea and the primary role of unfavourable environmental conditions on low recruitment in specific years (i.e. 2011).

Also found was that pollack adult biomass was significantly lower for elevated water temperatures, while the response for haddock was less clear. However the main decline of both stocks and the disappearance of their adult aggregations occurred several decades before the unprecedented warming trend, which started in the Skagerrak and Kattegat only in the mid-1980s.

We present a method for estimating migration and fishing mortality rates for anadromous fishes that combines tag return data from commercial and recreational fisheries with expert opinion in a Bayesian framework. By integrating diverse sources of information and allowing for missing data, this approach may be particularly applicable in data-limited situations. Wild populations of anadromous sea trout (Salmo trutta) in the northern Baltic Sea have undergone severe declines, with the loss of many populations. The contribution of fisheries to this decline has not been quantified, but is thought to be significant. We apply the Bayesian mark-recapture model to two reared sea trout stocks from the Finnish Isojoki and Lestijoki Rivers. Over the study period (1987-2012), the total harvest rate was estimated to average 0.82 y(-1) for the Isojoki River stock and 0.74 y(-1) for the Lestijoki River stock. Recreational gillnet fishing at sea was estimated to be the most important source of fishing mortality for both stocks, particularly during the 1980s and 1990s.

Here, we describe the spatio-temporal dynamics in fish community traits using >30 yr of species abundance data from the North Sea combined with trait information on body size, life history, growth rate, reproduction and trophic level for demersal fish species in the area. We assessed whether the derived patterns and trends in community-weighted mean traits could be explained by a range of environmental stressors and fishing. Our results revealed strong spatial structuring and long-term changes in the trait composition of North Sea fish, with temporal changes not being uniformly distributed in space. Among the environmental drivers investigated, depth was one of the best predictors, primarily explaining the spatial variation in lifespan, growth rate, trophic level and fecundity. This can be explained by variables that co-vary with depth, e.g. temperature, seasonality, salinity and productivity. Finally, we found only weak relationships between fishing and the spatial variation of traits, suggesting that the spatial trait composition of the community is mostly determined by the environment. Yet, long-term changes in trait composition, primarily in body size, have previously been shown to be affected by size-selective fishing.

Using a 12 year time series obtained by a summer survey in the western Baltic Sea, at least three distinct demersal fish species assemblages were identified. Their spatial distribution was relatively stable over time and could be linked to environmental gradients. The demersal fish assemblages were dominated by few species and differed primarily in the percentage of common species. Both, the demersal and the flatfish assemblage were structured according to different habitat preferences. While there were species-specific differences, boosted regression tree modelling (BRT) showed that interannual fluctuations explained a large percentage of the variance in flatfish abundance whereby salinity, water temperature and sediment type were identified as the most important abiotic drivers. Dab was mainly influenced by sediment type and high salinity, while for flounder the main driver was water temperature. Plaice was also impacted by salinity, but was primarily influenced by biotic variables. The availability of benthic prey organisms in the area was verified as biotic driver for flatfish, especially for plaice.

However, since then the plaice population has declined and the rate of discarding outside the Plaice Box has increased, suggesting an offshore shift in spatial distribution of juvenile plaice. Using research vessel survey data collected since 1970, the change in distribution of juvenile age groups was analysed in relation to the distance to the coast. Further, a comparison of the distribution of different length classes of plaice between three historic periods was made (1902-1909; 1983-1987; 1999-2003). A shift towards deeper water of larger-sized plaice (20-39 cm) is apparent already before the 1980s and may be related to the decrease in the number of competitors or predators. An offshore shift in the distribution of young plaice occurred in the 1990s most likely in response to higher water temperatures that may have exceeded the maximum tolerance range or increased the food requirements above the available food resources. A decrease in competition with larger plaice offshore, possibly in combination with increased inshore predation by cormorants and seals, may also have played a role. The offshore shift in distribution has reduced the effectiveness of the Plaice Box as a technical measure to protect the under-sized plaice from discarding, since an increased proportion of the population of undersized plaice is moving to the more heavily exploited offshore areas.

Batoids had a preferential distribution on the continental shelf (10-200 m depth). while shark species were more frequent on the slope (200-800 m depth). Only three species, the Carcharhiniformes Galeus melastomus and Scyliorhinus canicida and the Torpediniformes Torpedo matmorata were caught in all GSAs studied. On the continental shelf, the Rajidae family was the most abundant, being represented in primis by Raja clavaia and then by R. miraleius, R. polystigma and R. asterias.

Results of generalized additive models highlighted that depth is one of the most important environmental drivers influencing the distribution of both batoid and shark species, although temperature also showed a significant influence on their distribution. The approach explored in this work shows the possibility of producing maps modelling the distribution of demersal chondrichthyans in the Mediterranean that are useful for the management and conservation of these species at a regional scale.

Female LFDs were correlated up to a range of 15 km and males up to 25 km. Cluster analysis of the LFDs, interpreted taking into account the autocorrelation length scales, indicated two to three main clusters of geographically connected stations for male LFDs and smaller clusters with weaker spatial contiguity of stations in the case of female LFDs. Inter cluster differences in median length, mean weight, range in length, size at putative ages 2 and 3 and the proportion of mature females were apparent. These parameters reliably classified over 80% of stations to their respective clusters in a direct discriminant analysis. The biological characteristics were partially dependent on sediment grain size composition as shown by a canonical correlation analysis. Median length, mean weight, size at ages 2 and 3 and the percentage of females that were mature were all negatively correlated with finer sediments. There was a stronger interdependence between the sediments and the female data, compared with the male data.

There is evidence that mean carapace length and biomass have opposite and quadratic relationships with silt clay content if a wider range of sediments is analyzed (Anonymous, 1988). Apparently, mean carapace length is at a minimum and biomass at a maximum when the silt clay content is between 40 and 80%. The mechanism linking slow growth to areas of finer sediment in the Irish Sea is unclear. The correlation may not represent a direct cause-effect but could be linked through other factors such as density dependant effects on growth or the effects of spatially variable temperature on growth. There is also the probability of spatially variable fishing pressure. Fishing pressure estimated for stations on an east-west transect on the grid by Tully et al. ( 1989) was greater in the center of the grid and inflicted higher mortality (Tully et al., 1989) and a lowering of mean size in this area.",The autocorrelation length scales for male and female LFDs were different indicating sex-specific effects and the sediment explained more of the spatial variability in female biological characteristics than it did for males.

The potential fecundity (the stock of vitellogenic oocytes in the pre-spawning ovary), egg size (diameter and dry weight of artificially fertilized 1-day-old eggs) and gonad dry weight were assessed for fish sampled in SD 25 and SD 28. Multiple regression analysis identified somatic weight, or total length in combination with Fulton's condition factor, as main predictors of fecundity and gonad dry weight with stage of maturity (oocyte packing density or leading cohort) as an additional predictor. For egg size, somatic weight was identified as main predictor while otolith weight (proxy for age) was an additional predictor. Univariate analysis using GLM revealed significantly higher fecundity and gonad dry weight for turbot from SD 28 (3378-3474 oocytes/g somatic weight) compared to those from SD 25 (2343 oocytes/g somatic weight), with no difference in egg size (1.05 +/- 0.03 mm diameter and 46.8 +/- 6.5 mu g dry weight; mean +/- sd). The difference in egg production matched egg survival probabilities in relation to salinity conditions suggesting selection for higher fecundity as a consequence of poorer reproductive success at lower salinities. This supports the hypothesis of higher size-specific fecundity towards the limit of the distribution of a species as an adaptation to harsher environmental conditions and lower offspring survival probabilities. Within SD 28 comparisons were made between two major fishing areas targeting spawning aggregations and a marine protected area without fishing. The outcome was inconclusive and is discussed with respect to potential fishery induced effects, effects of the salinity gradient, effects of specific year-classes, and effects of maturation status of sampled fish.

in accordance to salinity conditions (Nissling et al., 2006). Analysis revealed significant differences in the potential fecundity between turbot from ICES SD 25 and SD 28 with higher size-specific fecundity for fish from SD 28 but with no difference in egg size. The
higher allocation of resources into gonad production was balanced by
lower growth. The difference in fecundity matched egg survival probabilities in relation to salinity conditions suggesting selection for higher fecundity as a consequence of poorer reproductive success at lower salinities. The outcome of the analysis suggested difficulties in separating fishery-induced effects from salinity adaptations in the Baltic Sea. Fishing mortality involves both phenotypic and genotypic changes (summarized by Rochet, 2009); evolutionary changes in life history traits may induce an increase in reproductive investment (gonad weight and fecundity) balanced by a decreased growth rate. This
means that populations subject to high fishing mortality can be expected to display an increased size specific fecundity and decreased size at maturity. 
","Assessment of fecundity of fish sampled in 2007 vs. 2010 yielded
considerably lower estimates, ~30%, when full manual counting was
performed. This inter-annual discrepancy cannot be due to differences in fish condition, as fish were found to be in similar condition in 2007 and 2010, but to methodological shortcomings.","Task 5.4.

By the early 2000s, high fishing mortality had resulted in truncated size-structure of the stock and decreased CPUEs (Fiskeriverket, 2010). The comparison of size-specific fecundity, was inconclusive, between the two major fishing areas (HB and EG) and the unfished marine protected area (GS). The samples obtained in 2007 suggested a higher size-specific fecundity (~ 13%) at the GS area compared to the fished areas, showing a potential selection for later maturation and thus at a larger size, accompanied with lower fecundity an effect of an intense spawning fishery as discussed in Rochet (2009). The pattern observed in 2007 may also be the cause of the decrease in salinity towards the north. Hence, the authors suggest that turbot from SD 25 and SD 28, should be managed as two separate stocks."

Fishing stations were distributed along the entire coast within four depth bands to 20 m. A total of 104 species were caught between 1973 and 1995, and these included infrequent Lusitanean species such as the big-scale sand-smelt (Atherina boyeri), and the undulate ray (Raja undulata). and infrequent boreal species such as the Norway haddock (Sebastes viviparus). Fifty-four taxa were selected as representative of the small, demersal inshore fish community that would be most vulnerable to capture by the two sampling gears, and were used in subsequent analyses of community structure. The north-east coast assemblage was the least diverse (H'=1.58) and least even (J'=0.47). II also supported the least number of species (55), and the variation in catch of the only dominant genus, Pomatoschistus spp., was partly responsible for large year-to-year variations in diversity and in the total population abundance of selected demersal species. On the east and south-east coasts, both diversity (H'=1.78 and 1.93) and evenness (J'=0.50 and 0.51) were greater than in the north, as a result of larger numbers of species available to the gears, and several species with relatively high catch density, such as Pomatoschistus spp., dab (Limanda limanda), solenette (Buglossidium luteum), and dragonet (Callionymidae).

Fishing stations were distributed along the entire coast within four depth bands to 20 m.

Fifty-four taxa were selected as representative of the small, demersal inshore fish community that would be most vulnerable to capture by the two sampling gears, and were used in subsequent analyses of community structure. The north-east coast assemblage was the least diverse (H'=1.58) and least even (J'=0.47). II also supported the least number of species (55), and the variation in catch of the only dominant genus, Pomatoschistus spp., was partly responsible for large year-to-year variations in diversity and in the total population abundance of selected demersal species. On the east and south-east coasts, both diversity (H'=1.78 and 1.93) and evenness (J'=0.50 and 0.51) were greater than in the north, as a result of larger numbers of species available to the gears, and several species with relatively high catch density, such as Pomatoschistus spp., dab (Limanda limanda), solenette (Buglossidium luteum), and dragonet (Callionymidae).

Biological studies are however scarce and information about finer scale population structure important for stock assessments and fishery management is largely lacking. Here, we report on a population genetic study using neutral and outlier SNP loci assessing population structure in hake in the north-eastern parts of its range in the Atlantic. Hake samples from localities along the west coast of Norway, the Kattegat, the northern North Sea, and one locality in the Bay of Biscay were analysed using 53 SNPs, six of which were outliers potentially influenced by natural selection. We detected small-scale structure among northern samples, all of which were also distinct from Bay of Biscay hake, with the exception of a few individuals from the North Sea and the coast of Norway who clustered genetically together with Bay of Biscay hake. Our findings suggest that the present management unit of a single northern stock of hake is not biologically correct, and that there is more detail in the fine-scale population structure indicating that independent population dynamics could be expected in response to fishing patterns or changing environmental conditions.",English,Article,,Web of Science,K,CS - North Sea,">100,000",decade,,year,,MRDM,,,,"Our results clearly show that the “northern stock” is actually subdivided into several genetically differentiated units, of which Kattegat, Norwegian Coast, North Sea could be identified in this study. However, to fully understand the interconnectivity that seem to exist among the northern populations, further studies are needed to specifically resolve this issue. For now, we suggest that this structure should be included in any predictive modelling, especially population responses to climate change. The present study provides evidence for both large scale and fine scale population structure in European hake in the Northeast Atlantic. The division between the Bay of Biscay and hake populations located in the North Sea and beyond is evident both from presumed neutral and outlier loci; the structure in the outlier loci correlates with water temperature most likely indicating adaptive differentiation. Moreover, significant population structuring was found at a regional scale in the North Sea and adjacent coastal areas. Our data have highlighted the likely movement of hake between the Kattegat and North Sea while indicating differentiation of hake found to the north of the North Sea (above 62o N).","While some of the observed genetic heterogeneity was due to loci likely influenced by local selection pressures, a neutral population structure was also evident, indicating a restricted migration/gene flow between the populations.",Task 5.5.

Very few elements on the evaluation of the MLS in regard to the catch and landings of the small-scale fisheries in the Mediterranean exist and this is due to both the great heterogeneity of the sector and the lack of systematic monitoring. The catch length composition of five species (Merluccius merluccius, Diplodus annularis, Mullus barbatus, Sepia officinalis and Squilla mantis) from a yearly record of small-scale fishing operations in the Patraikos Gulf(w. Greece, e. Mediterranean) was associated with temporal (season), spatial (depth of fishing, substrate type) and fishery (metier) characteristics by means of general linear models. Smaller individuals appeared in the catch in autumn for all five species indicating this season as suitable if a seasonal fishery Closure was established. When length was found to be significantly different between different metiers this was either due to smaller mesh sizes (M. barbatus) or due to gear type (M. merluccius). For all species except S. officinalis, depth significantly affected length of individuals in the catch providing in the case of M. merluccius a clear association of bigger individuals with deeper fishing grounds.

The low abundance and the similarities make them particularly interesting to study the population dynamics because it raises the questions how the populations can sustain themselves at low abundances and how turbot and brill avoid strong interspecific competition. Knowledge of both species is hampered by lack of analysed data. The main objective of this study is therefore to increase the knowledge of turbot and brill and in particular to compare the two species in order to address the above questions. Based on biological samples collected in the North Sea, we calculated seasonal von Bertalanffy growth parameters, maturity ogives, monthly gonado-somatic indices (GSI) and condition factors (Fulton's K) and indices of inter- and intraspecific mean crowding and compared the results for turbot and brill. The main differences between the two species were found in their spawning period, with brill having a more protracted spawning period. Brill also showed an earlier peak in their GSI values, suggesting an earlier start of their spawning period. The mean crowding showed that interspecific competition was lower than intraspecific competition. The exploitation pattern was also studied. Turbot and brill are exploited as a bycatch species in the mixed demersal fishery. We found that productivity is highest in areas where the maximum temperature is close to the optimal temperature for growth (16-18 degrees C) and landings decrease where salinity falls below similar to 5 psu (turbot) and similar to 15 psu (brill).

Fish behaviour is specified in terms of swimming speed and direction, as well as times of vertical migration and the duration of the intervening period in midwater. Times of vertical migration to and from the bottom can be specified theoretically in relation to regular tidal events (slackwater, high or low tide, etc.), or practically using actual observations made by sonar or data storage (archival) lags.

Past studies of North Sea whiting (Merlangius merlangus) distribution have led to differing views about the comparative importance of extrinsic and intrinsic constraints on adult distribution in the North Sea. In this study the importance of environmental influences on spawning distribution was examined using GAMs in a two steps approach, after demonstrating from geospatial analyses that there were no confounding density dependent effects on distribution during the period of low stock size investigated. The binomial model (probability of presence) showed a lower predictive power than the negative binomial model (abundance) although the final model (delta model) showed similar performance to previous studies. Whiting showed high plasticity in spawning ground selection with extensive areas of the North Sea appearing suitable across the study period. Nevertheless, a divide between two centres of persistent spawning aggregation was found consistent with the boundary previously suggested from parasite, genetic, otolith chemistry and demographic trends. In addition to aggregations suggested by past egg surveys, another spawning area off the north east Scottish coast was identified. The study identified springtide as a key physical determinant of whiting spawning distribution, which may be linked to the need for larvae to be advected offshore. Contrary to past studies, peak abundance was found around 125 m bottom depth, although there may have been differences in physical preferences related to the region of the North Sea studied.

Despite undertaking long-distance migrations after attaining sexual maturity, the cod aggregations in the two study areas appear to be largely separated from each other. This conclusion is supported by DSTs, indicating that mature fish associated with the two areas occupy different thermal-bathymetric niches.

Low recruitment along with a decline in spawning stock biomass have been observed for several years. According to the recruitment hypotheses, larval survival may play an important role that needs to be considered. The fish larval condition can be assessed using histology which has been recognised as the most appropriate method to provide a reliable index of the nutritional status. Based on this approach, this study aimed to identify critical periods of wild-collected sole larvae and to determine sources of variations of their condition between two periods separated by more than 20 years. In line with other studies, the transition from endogenous to exogenous feeding was identified as the most critical period with the lowest proportion of healthy larvae observed. During this first feeding stage, good larval conditions were located in sampling stations close to the coast and at the end of the spring season, in relation to higher temperature and fluorescence values.

Despite the recent interest in phylogenetic and functional diversity, our knowledge on large spatio-temporal patterns of demersal fish diversity sampled by trawling remains still incomplete, notably in the Mediterranean Sea, one of the most threatened marine regions of the world. We investigated large spatio-temporal diversity patterns by analysing a dataset of 19,886 hauls from 10 to 800 m depth performed annually during the last two decades by standardised scientific bottom trawl field surveys across the Mediterranean Sea, within the MEDITS program. A multicomponent (eight diversity indices) and multi-scale (local assemblages, biogeographic regions to basins) approach indicates that only the two most traditional components (species richness and evenness) were sufficient to reflect patterns in taxonomic, phylogenetic or functional richness and divergence. We also put into question the use of widely computed indices that allow comparing directly taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity within a unique mathematical framework. In addition, demersal fish assemblages sampled by trawl do not follow a continuous decreasing longitudinal/latitudinal diversity gradients (spatial effects explained up to 70.6% of deviance in regression tree and generalised linear models), for any of the indices and spatial scales analysed. Indeed, at both local and regional scales species richness was relatively high in the Iberian region, Malta, the Eastern Ionian and Aegean seas, meanwhile the Adriatic Sea and Cyprus showed a relatively low level. In contrast, evenness as well as taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional divergences did not show regional hotspots. All studied diversity components remained stable over the last two decades. Overall, our results highlight the need to use complementary diversity indices through different spatial scales when developing conservation strategies and defining delimitations for protected areas.

A life cycle approach was used to quantify the relative influence of these stressors on the Eastern English Channel (EEC) population of the common sole (Solea solea), a coastal-nursery dependent flatfish population which sustains important fisheries. The common sole has a complex life cycle: after eggs hatch, larvae spend several weeks drifting in open water. Survivors go on to metamorphose into benthic fish. Juveniles spend the first two years of their life in coastal and estuarine nurseries. Close to maturation, they migrate to deeper areas, where different subpopulations supplied by different nurseries reproduce and are exploited by fisheries. A spatially structured age-and stage-based hierarchical Bayesian model integrating various aspects of ecological knowledge, data sources and expert knowledge was built to quantitatively describe this complex life cycle. The model included the low connectivity among three subpopulations in the EEC, the influence of hydrographic variability, the availability of suitable juvenile habitat and fisheries. Scenarios were designed to quantify the effects of interacting stressors on population renewal. Results emphasized the importance of coastal nursery habitat availability and quality for the population renewal. Realistic restoration scenarios of the highly degraded Seine estuary produced a two-third increase in catch potential for the adjacent subpopulation. Fisheries, however, remained the main source of population depletion. Setting fishing mortality to the maximum sustainable yield led to substantial increases in biomass (+100%) and catch (+33%) at the EEC scale. The approach also showed how climate-driven variability in hydrography is likely to interact with human pressures, e.g., overfishing increased the sensitivity to unfavourable conditions. Our results provided insights into the dynamics of numerous exploited coastal-nursery-dependent species while paving the way toward more robust advice for sustainable management of these resources.

Demersal fish assemblages inhabiting these shelves account for one-fourth of landed wild marine species. Increasing spatial claims for nature protection and wind farm energy suppresses, however, the area available to fisheries. In this marine spatial planning discussion, it is essential to understand what defines suitable fishing grounds for bottom trawlers. We developed a statistical methodology to study the habitat preference of a fishery, accounting for spatial correlation naturally present in fisheries data using high-resolution location data of fishing vessels and environmental variables. We focused on two types of beam trawls to target sole using mechanical or electrical stimulation. Although results indicated only subtle differences in habitat preference between the two gear types, a clear difference in spatial distribution of the two gears was predicted. We argue that this change is driven by both changes in habitat preference as well as a change in target species distribution.

Fishing in areas with higher gravel content and (to a lesser extent) more rocks is generally avoided. No preference for a specific range of mud fractions was found. For the distance to harbour variable, preference was rather similar over a broad range of distances between 50 and 300km from harbour representing the fishing area for sole outside the 12nm zone and below the northern border of the study area. Comparison of the preference curves between gear types shows that pulse trawling has a slight but significant stronger preference for the intermediate depths of BPI 75 and a lower preference for deeper and slightly elevated areas than tickler chain gear. Although the overall distribution of fishing activity is similar between the two gear types, there are areas where pulse trawls are more active, such as in the southwestern part of the North Sea, while tickler chains are more dominant in the south eastern part (i.e. German Bight)"

Distances travelled are affected by factors such as: release time and location, egg and larval stage duration, local environmental conditions and active swimming and settlement behaviours. Understanding such dispersal patterns is important for the design of effective ecosystem-conservation strategies. We used a regional scale, coupled physical-biological model for the Irish Sea to simulate the possible dispersal of eggs and larvae of five species of fish with contrasting early life histories (cod Gadus morhua, plaice Pleuronectes platessa, witch Glyptocephalus cynoglossus, sprat Sprattus sprattus and pogge Agonus cataphractus). The hydrodynamic model was forced with meteorological data for 1995, a year when extensive plankton surveys were conducted in the Irish Sea. A particle tracking method featuring particle release (spawning) and species-dependent particle development and behaviour was then run based on flow and temperature fields from the hydrodynamical model. Modelled larval distributions and settlement areas corresponded favourably with observations from field sampling. The settlement destinations (or onset of shoaling for sprat) were affected both by their initial spawning location and by the species-specific development rates and behaviours coded into the model. Eggs and larvae typically remained within 160 km of their spawning origin, although a minority travelled up to 300 km. Even in a relatively enclosed sea such as the Irish Sea, fish eggs and larvae can be dispersed over 100s of km. This provides a major challenge for the design of effective spatial management strategies if it is necessary to protect a species across its life-history stages. Further progress in the design of effective conservation measures for species or communities will need an integrated approach taking account of key aspects of early life history and behaviour.

Yet, uncertainties subsist regarding on the shift rate, causalities, and how this species will respond to future conditions. Using egg surveys, we explored the influence of temperature change on mackerel's spawning distribution (western and southern spawning components of the stock) between 1992 and 2013, and projected how it may change under future climate change scenarios. We developed three generalized additive models (GAMs): (i) a spatiotemporal model to reconstruct the spawning distribution for the north-east Atlantic stock over the period 1992-2013, to estimate the rate of shift; (ii) a thermal habitat model to assess if spawning mackerel have tracked their thermal spawning-niche; and (iii) a niche-based model to project future spawning distribution under two predicted climate change scenarios. Our findings showed that mackerel spawning activity has shifted northward at a rate of 15.9 +/- 0.9 km/decade between 1992 and 2013. Similarly, using the thermal habitat model, we detected a northward shift of the thermal spawning-niche. This indicates that mackerel has spawned at higher latitudes to partially tracking their thermal spawning-niche, at a rate of 28.0 +/- 9.0 km/degrees C of sea warming. Under future scenarios (mid and end of the century), the extrapolation of the niche-based model to coupled hydroclimatic and biogeochemical models indicates that center of gravity of mackerel spawning distribution is expected to shift westward (32 to 117 km) and northward (0.5 to 328 km), but with high variability according to scenarios and time frames.

This information is critical to identify suitable areas for spatial management, aimed at preserving biodiversity, ecosystem functions or essential habitats. While demersal fish have been extensively studied at the community scale, small pelagic fish have mainly been characterised at the population scale. This paper presents a community-based approach on the biodiversity of small pelagic fish, with the aim to: (i) define small pelagic fish communities, (ii) characterise their spatial and interannual dynamics, and (iii) assess their habitats. We present a Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA)-based method that characterises the spatio-temporal variability in a series of multivariate maps. The main components of variability in these maps are identified to define characteristic areas displaying contrasting conditions in both MFA ordination and geographical spaces. Characteristic habitats of fish communities were defined by the correlation between the main components of variability from MFAs applied to maps containing fish information on one hand, and on hydrographic variables on the other hand. The analysis of the long term PELGAS survey series of fish biomass and hydrological indices maps resulted in the characterisation of mesoscale latitudinal gradients and coarse to mesoscale onshore-off-shore gradients in both fish and hydrology datasets. A community with anchovy (E. encrasicolus) and chub mackerel (S. colias) as indicator species was consistently distributed in southeast Biscay. This area was associated with higher bottom temperatures, which likely affected the fish community through physiological processes. A second community with small clupeiforms as indicator species was found in coastal spawning habitats. These habitats were typically characterised by low salinity, a probable proxy for high productivity and good feeding grounds for those species. Mapping the habitats of small pelagic fish communities may inform marine spatial management, aimed at preserving biodiversity, ecosystem structure and function.

While numerous studies have documented changes in species' distributions and abundances in response to warming [1, 2], the consequences for the functional structure of ecosystems (i.e., composition of species' functional traits) have received less attention. Here, using thirty years of fish monitoring, we show that two connected North Atlantic ecosystems (E. English Channel and S. North Sea) underwent a rapid shift in functional structure triggered by a climate oscillation to a prevailing warm-phase in the late-1990s. Using time-lag-based causality analyses, we found that rapid warming drove pelagic fishes with r-selected life history traits (e.g., low age and size at maturity, small offspring, low trophic level) to shift abruptly northward from one ecosystem to the other, causing an inversion in functional structure between the two connected ecosystems. While we observed only a one-year time-lag between the climate oscillation and the functional shift, indicating rapid responses to a changing environment, historical overfishing likely rendered these ecosystems susceptible to climatic stress [3], and declining fishing in the North Sea may have exacerbated the shift. This shift likely had major consequences for ecosystem functioning due to potential changes in biomass turnover, nutrient cycling, and benthic-pelagic coupling [4-6 ]. Under ongoing warming, climate oscillations and extreme warming events may increase in frequency and severity [7, 8 ], which could trigger functional shifts with profound consequences for ecosystem functioning and services.",English,Article,,Web of Science,K,CS - North Sea,">100,000",multidecadal,,year,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey,?ultiple linear regression,,,,"Climate oscillations and warm extremes are predicted to increase in frequency and severity under ongoing climate change (Cai, et al., 2014, Moore, et al., 2017, Frölicher, et al., 2018, Alexander, et al., 2018). In particular, El Nin ? o events are expected to double in frequency given current trends in greenhouse gas emissions (Cai, et al., 2014). Future climate change is therefore likely to cause functional shifts and reorganization of ecosystems with unknown consequences (Lindegren, et al., 2018). While immediate drastic measures have been recommended to abate human-induced climate change
(Change, 2007), our results provide insight for pre-emptive conservation planning under current climate projections. Marine resource management, particularly in connected ecosystems with large latitudinal gradients, must prepare for changes in ecosystem functioning and services, and future ocean governance must anticipate such rapid functional shifts (Pinsky, et al., 2018).","Although we found that changes in fish functional structure

in the EEC, has led to a long-term shifting baseline as historically

In most cases, egg density was found to be strongly related to these environmental variables. The annual habitat maps resulting from the specific environmental configuration of the study area highlighted that higher salinities often favored high egg densities. Also, the temperature was found to be negatively correlated to egg density. That's why egg densities were positively correlated with shallow to intermediate depths, because of the low temperatures and relatively high salinity. "

The Gotland Basin spawning ground is one of three main spawning areas of Baltic cod, Gadus morhua Linnaeus, 1758.

Major inflows into the Baltic usually take place in the period from August to April, in 60% of the cases from November through January (Matthäus 2006). The hydrological changes in the Gotland Basin usually occur 6–9 months after an inflow was registered in the Bornholm Basin, respectively during May-August (Kaleis 1977). Oxygen is mainly renewed by inflows and is depleted due to biochemical processes (Kaleis 1989). The egg survival strongly decreases if the temperature is below 2°C (Wieland et al. 1994).

Analyses of the period from the end of the 1970s also reveal that under variable environmental conditions cod recruitment in the Gotland Basin is mainly determined by environmental factors and only to a less extent by the adult fish or potential spawning stock size.

The hydrological changes in the Gotland Basin usually occur 6–9 months after an inflow was registered in the Bornholm Basin, respectively during May-August (Kaleis 1977).

The Gotland Basin spawning ground is one of three main spawning areas of Baltic cod, Gadus morhua Linnaeus, 1758. The threshold water parameters for cod development are the salinity exceeding 11% and the oxygen level above 2 mL . L-1. Such conditions are only present when the 11% isohaline is above the 2 mL . L-1 isooxygen. In such situation the water volume between the isolines is called the suitable reproduction volume. When the position of the isolines is reversed, the salinity and the oxygen level of the water layer demarcated by them are below the required thresholds and as such the water is unsuitable for the cod development. We refer to it as the unsuitable reproduction volume. The main aim of the presently reported study was to examine whether variations in suitable and unsuitable reproduction habitat estimates could explain the fluctuations in cod recruitment. Material and methods. The suitable and unsuitable reproduction volumes in the Gotland Basin were estimated based on single point observations at three oceanographic monitoring stations using the contouring software Balthypsograph. To test the spatial hydrological heterogeneity in the Gotland Basin we used 15 observations during 1969-1995 on four stations in each of two transects. The oceanographic monitoring and demersal trawl research survey data from 1974-2012 have been used in analyses. Results. The sufficient reproduction conditions in the southern Gotland Basin persisted only until 1981. In later decades the reproduction potential of the Gotland Basin has decreased. The latest major North Sea water inflows in 1993 and 2003 in the Central Gotland Basin formed the suitable reproduction volume below the layers where cod eggs are floating. A significant relation between the recruit abundance and suitable and the unsuitable reproduction volumes was found only for the Southern Gotland Basin (P < 0.03). Conclusions. We demonstrated that single-point estimates sufficiently quantify the reproduction conditions in the Gotland Basin and thus can be used for estimation of the reproduction volumes.

Highly mobile fish form an integral part of marine food webs providing linkages within and among habitats, between patches of habitats, and at different life stages. We investigated how movement, activity, and connectivity patterns of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) are influenced by dynamic environmental conditions. Movement patterns of 39 juvenile and subadult Atlantic cod were assessed in two coastal sites in the Swedish Skagerrak for 5 months. We used passive acoustic telemetry and network analysis to assess seasonal and spatial movement patterns of cod and their relationships to different environmental factors, using statistical correlations, analysis of recurrent spatial motifs, and generalized linear mixed models. Temperature, in combination with physical barriers, precludes significant connectivity (complex motifs) within the system. Sea surface temperature had a strong influence on connectivity (node strength, degree, and motif frequency), where changes from warmer summer waters to colder winter waters significantly reduced movement activity of fish. As the seasons changed, movement of fish gradually decreased from large-scale (km) linkages in the summer to more localized movement patterns in the winter (limited to 100s m). Certain localized areas, however, were identified as important for connectivity throughout the whole study period, likely due to these multiple-habitat areas fulfilling functions required for foraging and shelter.

Here, to model the contemporary (1990-2017) spatial distribution of seven highly harvested European small pelagic fish species, we implemented a comprehensive and replicable numerical procedure based on 8 SDMs (7 from the Biomod2 framework plus the NPPEN model). This procedure considers critical issues in species distribution modelling such as sampling bias, pseudo-absence selection, model evaluation and uncertainty quantification respectively through (i) an environmental filtration of observation data, (ii) a convex hull based pseudo-absence selection, (iii) a multi-criteria evaluation of model outputs and (iv) an ensemble modelling approach. By mitigating environmental sampling bias in observation data and by identifying the most ecologically relevant predictors, our framework helps to improve the modelling of fish species' environmental suitability.

The IBM successfully predicted inter-annual differences in settlement regardless of larval behaviour. The highest settlement success was predicted with neutrally buoyant eggs, hatchlings, and larval stages, in combination with tidal migration at the final larval stage.

In the Palam´os harbor, alocal management plan restricts fishing in certain locations to sustain the resource. However, little is known about the dispersal of larvae; specifically, it is not known how far larvae are transported from spawning locations and if there could be mixing of larvae between different fishing areas. The objective of this study was to estimate the spawning sites of larvae collected at 35 sampling stations, evaluate uncertainty in the estimates, and determine if larvae could be exchanged between fishing areas. The spawning sites of larvae were estimated by backward simulation of larval trajectories using a 3-dimensional coupled hydrodynamic and Lagrangian transport model. The backtracked larvae were assigned temperature-dependent stage durations based on a literature review of similar species. Results of model simulations indicated that the median distances from sampling to spawning locations were 11 and 38 km when shortest and longest pelagic durations (PD) were implemented, respectively. Sensitivity studies of backward trajectories showed that distance estimates could vary by as much as 27, 3, and 8 km due to differences in simulated PD, sub-grid-scale turbulence, and advection, respectively. Larvae from 13 of the 35 sampling stations were tracked back to multiple fishing grounds, suggesting that mixing of larvae from different fishing areas could occur. For example, for the sampling stations within the restricted area of Palam´os, 35% of simulated larvae came from the restricted area itself, and 0.9% and 10% of larvae came from neighboring areas to the north and south, respectively.

This mechanism could be particularly crucial for the larvae of the heavily fished crustacean Nephrops norvegicus (L.), as their sediment requirements highly restrict where they are able to settle. Recent research suggests that the gyre may be becoming less retentive due to changes in atmospheric forcing; thus it is now crucial to understand how the gyre influences larval dispersal. This investigation addresses the hypothesis that shelf sea gyres reinforce larval retention, using a biophysical model with vertical migration, habitat selection and temperature-dependent pelagic larval duration (PLD) configured to match the behaviour of N. norvegicus larvae. The results suggest that the gyre does increase the likelihood that passive larvae remain within the western Irish Sea when the larvae remain fixed at the depth of peak gyral flow. However, retention rates are significantly lower when vertical migration is introduced, and there is no evidence that the gyre promotes larval retention amongst either vertically migrating larvae, or larvae that require muddy sediments for successful settlement. In contrast, vertical migration is shown to be favourable for local retention in the eastern Irish Sea. PLD varies by a factor of 2 according to release date and location.

In this idealised study, no a priori selection of specific spawning grounds or periods was made and no active behaviour (vertical migration) or mortality was included. In this study, egg and larval development towards coastal nursery areas was based solely on sea water temperature, while settlement areas were defined by a threshold water depth. Results showed strong inter-annual variability in drift direction and distance, caused by a combination of wind speed and direction. Strong inter-annual variability was observed both in absolute amount of settlement in several coastal areas, and in the relative importance of the different areas. The effects of wind and temperature variability are minor for settlement along the western shores of the North Sea and in the English Channel, but have a very significant impact on settlement along the eastern shores of the North Sea. Years with strong south-westerly winds across the Dover Straight resulted in higher settlement figures along its eastern shores of the North Sea (standard deviation 37% of the mean annual settlement value).

The results from the various statistical techniques applied were in close agreement and all suggested that the ten statistical fishing subareas could be generally grouped into three main areas (northern, central and southern Aegean Sea) for the pelagic fishery and into two main areas (northern and southern Aegean Sea) for the demersal fishery, which differed considerably from each other in terms of species composition, species diversity and catch density (catch weight per unit area). In general, with respect to the pelagic fisheries, the catches from the northern, central and southern Aegean area groupings are dominated, respectively, by anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus (L.), 48.2%), horse mackerels (Trachurus spp., 23.2%) and bogue (Boops boops (L.), 40.6%). For the demersal fisheries, the catches from the northern and southern Aegean area groupings are dominated by grey mullets (Mugilidae, 10.3%) and pickerel (Spicara smaris (L.), 28.6%), respectively. The main factors which appear to be contributing to this geographical group differentiation are: (a) the gradient in the relative eutrophy, river runoff, temperature and salinity of the Aegean Sea waters along a NNW to SSE axis; and (b) the differences in extent of the continental shelf within these areas of the Aegean Sea.

The spatial pattern of fishing showed that three main areas are targeted: (1) the Celtic Deep (an area of deeper water with fine sediments), (2) the shelf edge, and (3) an area covering several large seabed banks in the central Celtic Sea. Data from each of these regions were analysed to examine the contrasting seasonality of fishing activity, and to highlight where the spring-neap tidal cycle appears to be important to fishing. The oceanographic characteristics of the Celtic Sea were considered alongside the distribution and timing of fishing, illustrating likely contrasts in the underlying environmental drivers of the different fished regions. In the central Celtic Sea, fishing mainly occurred during the stratified period between April and August. Based on evidence provided in other papers of this Special Issue, we suggest that the fishing in this area is supported by (1) a broad increase in primary production caused by lee-waves generated by seabed banks around spring tides driving large supplies of nutrients into the photic zone, and (2) greater concentrations of zooplankton within the region influenced by the seabed banks and elevated primary production. In contrast, while the shelf edge is a site of elevated surface chlorophyll, previous work has suggested that the periodic mixing generated by an internal tide at the shelf edge alters the sizestructure of the phytoplankton community which fish larvae from the spawning stocks along the shelf edge are able to exploit. The fishery for Nephrops norvegicus in the Celtic Deep was the only one to show a significant spring-neap cycle, possibly linked to Nephrops foraging outside their burrows less during spring tides. More tentatively, the fishery for Nephrops correlated most strongly with a localised shift in the tidal current polarisation, suggesting that the muddy seabed required by Nephrops is controlled by rotational constraints on the extent of the bottom boundary layer.

Size-based community metrics are potentially useful indicators because of their theoretical foundation and practical utility. Temporal and spatial patterns in size-based community metrics for Celtic Sea fish are described and calculated using data from the English groundfish survey of the area (1987-2003). The results reveal that the size structure of the community has changed over time, and that a decrease in the relative abundance of larger fish was accompanied by an increase in smaller fish (4-25 g). Temporal analyses of the effects of fishing and climate variation suggest that fishing generally has had a stronger effect on size structure than changes in temperature. Therefore, size-based metrics respond clearly to the effects of fishing even in variable environments, reflecting the ubiquity of size-based processes in defining community structure and responses to mortality. Spatial analyses were inconclusive, probably owing to the limited area for which fishing effort, temperature, and survey data were all available.

Specifically, AquaMaps, Maxent and the Sea Around Us Project algorithm are three approaches that have been applied to predict distributions of marine fishes and invertebrates. They were designed to cope with issues of data quality and quantity common in species distribution modelling, and especially pertinent to the marine environment. However, the characteristics of model projections for marine species from these different approaches have rarely been compared. Such comparisons provide information about the robustness and uncertainty of the projections, and are thus important for spatial planning and developing management and conservation strategies. Here we apply the three commonly used species distribution modelling methods for commercial fish in the North Sea and North Atlantic, with the aim of drawing comparisons between the approaches. The effect of different assumptions within each approach on the predicted current relative habitat suitability was assessed. Predicted current distributions were tested following data partitioning and selection of pseudoabsences from within a specified distance of occurrence data. As indicated by the test statistics, each modelling method produced plausible predictions of relative habitat suitability for each species, with subsequent incorporation of expert knowledge generally improving predictions. However, because of the differences between modelling algorithms, methodologies and patterns of relative suitability, comparing models using test statistics and selecting a 'best' model are not recommended. We propose that a multi-model approach should be preferred and a suite of possible predictions considered if biases due to uncertainty in data and model formulation are to be minimised.

The ecological niche (sensu Hutchinson) of a species, Le. the combination of environmental tolerances and resources required by an organism, interacts with the environment to determine its geographical range. This duality between niche and distribution allows climate change biologists to model potential species' distributions from past to future conditions. While species distribution models (SDMs) have been intensively used over the last years, no consensual framework to parametrise, calibrate and evaluate models has emerged. Here, to model the contemporary (1990-2017) spatial distribution of seven highly harvested European small pelagic fish species, we implemented a comprehensive and replicable numerical procedure based on 8 SDMs (7 from the Biomod2 framework plus the NPPEN model). This procedure considers critical issues in species distribution modelling such as sampling bias, pseudo-absence selection, model evaluation and uncertainty quantification respectively through (i) an environmental filtration of observation data, (ii) a convex hull based pseudo-absence selection, (iii) a multi-criteria evaluation of model outputs and (iv) an ensemble modelling approach. By mitigating environmental sampling bias in observation data and by identifying the most ecologically relevant predictors, our framework helps to improve the modelling of fish species' environmental suitability. Not only average temperature, but also temperature variability appears as major factors driving small pelagic fish distribution, and areas of highest environmental suitability were found along the north-westem Mediterranean coasts, the Bay of Biscay and the North Sea.

A total of 32 herring schools were tracked continuously for up to 1.2 h by multi-beam sonar. Larger herring schools swam faster and in warmer water masses than smaller schools. Herring had on average a low dynamic tendency, with relatively few split, join and behavioural events per hour, probably due to low temperatures near the Arctic front. No clear diurnal vertical migration was detected based on the acoustic data, and herring were distributed from the surface area down to approximately 360 m. Zooplankton biomass was the highest at the Arctic front and lower on both sides of the front, indicating that herring were successfully searching for high food concentrations there.

However, despite its wide geographical distribution, there have been few studies on fluctuations in the European hake populations. Marine ecosystem shifts have been investigated worldwide and their influence on trophic levels has been studied, from top predator fish populations down to planktonic prey species, but there is little information on the effect of atmosphere-ocean shifts on European hake. This work analyses hake recruitment success (recruits per adult biomass) in relation to environmental changes over the period 1978-2006 in order to determine whether the regime shift identified in several abiotic and biotic variables in the North Sea also affected the Northeast Atlantic shelf oceanography. Hake recruitment success as well as parameters such as the sea surface temperature, wind patterns and copepod abundance changed significantly at the end of the 1980s, demonstrating an ecological regime shift in the Northeast Atlantic. Despite the low reproductive biomass recorded during the last decades, hake recruitment success has been higher since the change in 1989/90. The higher productivity may have sustained the population despite the intense fishing pressure; copepod abundance, warmer water temperatures and moderate eastward transport were found to be beneficial. In conclusion, in 1988/89 the Northeast Atlantic environment shifted to a favourable regime for northern hake production.

The main contribution made by research-vessel trawl survey data to the stock assessment process is to tune trends in the commercial data and provide estimates of incoming year-class strength. In this process much of the information contained with the survey data (e.g. spatial detail) is lost because the data are first aggregated into numbers-at-age indices for given areas. Another problem is that increasingly restrictive total allowable catches (TACs) imposed on the fishing industry have led to what is suspected to be widespread misreporting, i.e. the scientists do not know how many fish have been landed. This leads to negative biases in the catch data, low stock abundance estimates by scientists, even lower TACs, followed by even more misreporting. One potential way to escape this downward spiral is to explore scientific trawl survey data in more detail since trawl surveys are more straightforward to regulate. Traditionally, there has been resistance to this idea since, in comparison to commercial catch-at-age data, trawl survey data are very sparse in space and time. In this study, the potential for using trawl survey data independently in stock assessments is explored for the case of ICES Area Via haddock, using two different tools.

Declines in maturation probability with size and age were evident within the North Sea cod stock, but the magnitude of decline differed among subpopulations. The difference in the rate of decline led to significant spatial differences in recent times. Changes in maturation probability could not be explained by colonization from adjacent regions indicating a local response to conditions. The greatest decline in maturation probability followed the near collapse of regional spawning biomass during the 1980s and 1990s. A new methodology was developed to integrate the effects of temperature and competitive biomass into the estimation of the PMRN. Temperature had a positive effect on maturation probability, but could only partially explain the decreasing trend in PMRN midpoints. Consequently, regional selection for early maturing genotypes provides the most parsimonious explanation for the declines in maturation probability observed.

the changes in maturation probability observed, it is possible to
rule out some explanations. The slowest-growing subpopulation
matured larger, contrary to expectations from counter-gradient
selection (Conover et al., 2006). Further, neither regional temperature
nor conspecific biomass could fully account for the highly significant
negative trends in Lp50 values. Therefore, given the likely
intense periods of size-selection mortality in the NW and S subpopulations,
selection for early maturing genotypes appears to
be the most parsimonious explanation for the temporal changes
in maturation probability. Recent debate on fisheries-induced
evolution has focused on the apparent rate of evolution estimated
from PMRN studies and the lower rates expected from the estimation
of selection differentials (Andersen and Brander, 2009).
The results of the present study indicate that the combined
effects of phenotypic response to temperature and genetic selection
for earlier and smaller size at maturation could be additive,
leading to bias in the estimate of evolutionary rates based on
PMRN alone. Given that warming trends are evident in many of

A life cycle approach was used to quantify the relative influence of these stressors on the Eastern English Channel (EEC) population of the common sole (Solea solea), a coastal-nursery dependent flatfish population which sustains important fisheries. The common sole has a complex life cycle: after eggs hatch, larvae spend several weeks drifting in open water. Survivors go on to metamorphose into benthic fish. Juveniles spend the first two years of their life in coastal and estuarine nurseries. Close to maturation, they migrate to deeper areas, where different subpopulations supplied by different nurseries reproduce and are exploited by fisheries. A spatially structured age-and stage-based hierarchical Bayesian model integrating various aspects of ecological knowledge, data sources and expert knowledge was built to quantitatively describe this complex life cycle. The model included the low connectivity among three subpopulations in the EEC, the influence of hydrographic variability, the availability of suitable juvenile habitat and fisheries. Scenarios were designed to quantify the effects of interacting stressors on population renewal. Results emphasized the importance of coastal nursery habitat availability and quality for the population renewal. Realistic restoration scenarios of the highly degraded Seine estuary produced a two-third increase in catch potential for the adjacent subpopulation. Fisheries, however, remained the main source of population depletion. Setting fishing mortality to the maximum sustainable yield led to substantial increases in biomass (+100%) and catch (+33%) at the EEC scale. The approach also showed how climate-driven variability in hydrography is likely to interact with human pressures, e.g., overfishing increased the sensitivity to unfavourable conditions. Our results provided insights into the dynamics of numerous exploited coastal-nursery-dependent species while paving the way toward more robust advice for sustainable management of these resources.

We sampled soft-seafloor macrofauna over a precise trawling gradient in the Kattegat using hourly vessel monitoring systems and logbooks. The gradient included the establishment of a marine protected area (MPA), where trawling intensity declined sharply to zero. Our results show shifts in the macrofauna assemblage and non-linear responses, with decreases in the number and diversity of species at low to medium trawling intensities. The benthic community was dominated by burrowing brittle stars, of which one species, Amphiura chiajei, increased in abundance from low to medium trawling intensities. We interpret this positive response to increasing trawling intensities as a consequence of reduction in predation by benthivorous flatfish and Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus, which are significant catches of the fishery.

Fluctuations were monitored by using a sample design based on fixed seasonal sampling of three different habitats (upper submarine canyon, middle slope, and lower slope). The results explain changes in fishing fleet and fishing location. The stock appears to remain constant at approximately optimum levels of exploitation because part of it is unexploited below 1,000 m. Factorial correspondence analysis indicated a generally strong influence of depth on the abundance of deep-water shrimp, explaining 63.14% of the variance. However, the influence of seasonality was stronger when only samples taken at depths shallower than 1,000 m (75.22%) were considered. Females contributed most to the catches on the upper and middle slope throughout the year, and catches of females were strongly related to seasonality (P<0.05). The combined interaction of depth and seasonality on the abundance of males was significant (P<0.05). Juveniles were present in the catches from autumn to spring, and the combined effect of depth and seasonality on the abundance of juveniles was also significant (P<0.05).

However, the ability to detect these impacts over large spatial scales can be obscured by various complicating factors, such as community adaptation to disturbance and co-varying environmental conditions. An ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management therefore requires ecological indicators which can 'disentangle' trawling effects from other natural and human drivers, and respond effectively to shifts in ecological quality. We collected benthic macrofaunal samples at 21 sites across a Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus fishing ground in the Kattegat, and separated the benthic community into small (1-4 mm) and large ( > 4 mm) size fractions. Four taxonomic indicators (total density, species density, Shannon diversity, and biomass) and four functional indicators (functional diversity, functional richness, functional evenness, and functional dispersion) were calculated based on each size fraction, and the two fractions combined (pooled community). Here, we compare the ability of these indicators to detect trawling impacts across size categories. We show that indicators derived from large macrofauna were highly effective in this regard, and were less influenced by other environmental drivers, such as depth, sediment grain size, bottom current velocity, salinity, and temperature. This suggests that the taxonomic and functional characteristics of benthic communities display a size-dependent sensitivity to trawling disturbance, and therefore community metrics based on large benthic macrofauna may provide useful indicators. By contrast, indicators derived from the small fraction performed poorly, and those based on the pooled community demonstrated a varied ability to detect trawling. Small macrofauna are typically characterised by high density, diversity, and population growth rates, and their relative resilience to trawling may mask the response of the more sensitive macrofauna. This highlights an underlying issue with calculating indicators based on the whole benthic community.

Furthermore, model simulations show that decreasing exploitation pressure in the source area for cod (without reallocating fishing effort) produces an increase in neighboring sink habitats, but a decline of prey species in response to increased predation.

However, species do not contribute equally to ecosystem processes and differ markedly in their responses to changing environments. This recognition has led to the exploration of other components of biodiversity, notably the diversity of ecologically important traits. Recent studies taking into account both taxonomic and trait diversity have revealed that the two biodiversity components may exhibit pronounced temporal and spatial differences. These apparent incongruences indicate that the two components may respond differently to environmental drivers and that changes in one component might not affect the other. Such incongruences may provide insight into the structuring of communities through community assembly processes, and the resilience of ecosystems to change. Here we examine temporal and spatial patterns and drivers of multiple marine biodiversity indicators using the North Sea fish community as a case study. Based on long-term spatially resolved survey data on fish species occurrences and bio-masses from 1983 to 2014 and an extensive trait dataset we: (i) investigate temporal and spatial incongruences between taxonomy and trait-based indicators of both richness and evenness; (ii) examine the underlying environmental drivers and, (iii) interpret the results in the context of assembly rules acting on community composition. Our study shows that taxonomy and trait-based biodiversity indicators differ in time and space and that these differences are correlated to natural and anthropogenic drivers, notably temperature, depth and substrate richness.

The reduction in juvenile mortality is particularly relevant in the Mediterranean and is considered as one of the main prerequisites for the future sustainability of trawl fisheries. The distribution of nursery areas of 11 important commercial species of demersal fish and shellfish was analysed in the European Union Mediterranean waters using time series of bottom trawl survey data with the aim of identifying the most persistent recruitment areas. A high interspecific spatial overlap between nursery areas was mainly found along the shelf break of many different sectors of the Northern Mediterranean indicating a high potential for the implementation of conservation measures. Overlap of the nursery grounds with existing spatial fisheries management measures and trawl fisheries restricted areas was also investigated. Spatial analyses revealed considerable variation depending on species and associated habitat/depth preferences with increased protection seen in coastal nurseries and minimal protection seen for deeper nurseries (e.g. Parapenaeus longirostris 6%). This is partly attributed to existing environmental policy instruments (e.g. Habitats Directive and Mediterranean Regulation EC 1967/2006) aiming at minimising impacts on coastal priority habitats such as seagrass, coralligenous and maerl beds.

Since the Millennium, cod fishing mortality has been reduced as a result of strict management and a reduction of the fishing fleet (Horwood et al., 2006). There are some initial signs of stock recovery in the most recent few years(Fig. 1b; ICES, 2013c). Fishing can make populations more sensitive to climate change by reducing abundance and density, truncating the age distribution (Ottersenet al., 2006). At low abundance levels, populations may retreat to sites of optimal habitat only (Blanchard et al., 2005). Because globally, fish stocks are typically subject to the combined pressures of climate change and exploitation, and because the fishing effort is often highly concentrated at specific localities within a species overall range, there is a need for wider recognition of the dual impact that both climate and fishing can have on fish distributions.",Looked at fish distribution changes over the whole northeast Atlantic region using combined survey datasets from multiple countries and found that 70% of the fish species seemed to have responded to warming by changing distribution and abundance. ,Task 5.2 Predicting species distribution ,Gadus morhua,juv and adults,bentho-pelagic,Commercial,Demersal trawls,Otter trawl,Fishing,biomass,Fishing,Yes,Biomass,Negative,high,"spatiotemporal: dynamic, movement, allocation, shift, migration, displacement (e.g. by depth)",species distribution model,species distribution model,Yes,"This study shows that distribution shifts of North Sea cod have not been limited to the most recent three decades (as reported by Hedger et al., 2004; Perry et al.,2005; Rindorf & Lewy, 2006; Dulvy et al., 2008), but took place throughout the past 100 years.

Improving understanding of the spatio-temporal dynamics of unwanted catches could assist the fishing industry optimize catches by altering where they fish. How following such advice relates to revenues and fishery dynamics requires more consideration. We take an existing hotspot mapping methodology and examine how it could be used to identify fishing opportunities under the LO in Irish (Celtic Sea) and Danish (North Sea and Skagerrak) demersal fisheries. We consider if fishing effort can be relocated to avoid unwanted catches while maintaining revenues. The value per unit effort of fishing activity in both areas was often linked to high catch rates of key demersal species (cod, haddock, hake, and whiting). Our analyses indicated, however, that there are options to fish in areas that could provide higher revenues while avoiding below minimum conservation reference size catches and choke species. This was evident across both case study areas demonstrating that hotspot mapping tools could have wide applicability. There does, however, remain a need to explore how the displacement of vessels may further alter species distributions and fleet economics.",English,Article,,Web of Science,K,CS - North Sea,">100,000",five year,,week,Fisheries Dependent Data,GLM (gamma distribution and log link function),,,,"Although options did exist to avoid unwanted catches while still fishing in areas of high VPUE for all examples considered. Spatiotemporal measures, potentially coupled with advanced mapping technology, may prove useful to optimize the use of available quotas. For discarding hotspots that occur in areas where there are high catches of other commercially important species,  spatial avoidance may not be possible as a tactic to reduce discards. In such areas, increased uptake of more selective gears, which may allow for the escape of gadoid species while retaining flatfish and crustaceans, could be beneficial instead (O’Neill et al., 2019). Identifying these discarding hotspots that are primarily the result of bycatch in other species fisheries is of critical importance, and this could be achieved by focusing similar analyses on more fleet segments and metiers, but this again requires a greater provision of fisheries data from the fleet.

In both North Sea locations, G. morhua was identified as the single top predator, while its TP was similar to other fish species in the Lofoten-Vesterålen region. Not only did the TP of G. morhua in relation to the other fish species differ between Lofoten-Vesterålen and the North Sea, but also its reliance on benthic affinity prey was much lower in the Lofoten-Vesterålen region than in the North Sea. This high reliance on pelagic feeding prey indicates that cod stocks in the Lofoten-Vesterålen region might be affected by the northward extension of typical pelagic species (Stenevik and Sundby, 2007). With the ongoing climate change, feeding migrations of mackerel to the North are expected earlier in the season (Utne et al., 2012). This leads to a large temporal overlap of mackerel and larvae of Norwegian spring-spawning herring, and the resulting predation could have regulatory effects on the herring stock (Skaret et al., 2015), and consequently on the available food for cod. In contrast, North Sea cod relied approximately equally on pelagic and benthic affinity prey, which is in accordance with previous studies of stable isotopes from Newfoundland and Labrador (Sherwood and Rose, 2005), and stomach contents from the North Sea (Hislop et al., 1997). Today, cod is only present in very low numbers in the southern North Sea and the ecosystem has shifted toward a flatfish dominated community, along with particularly high abundances of small, demersal, mesopredatory fish (B. luteum, Arnoglossus laterna, A. cataphractus, Pomatoschistus spp.) (Daan et al., 2005; Ehrich et al., 2007; van Hal et al., 2010). Our study has shown that the coupling of the benthic and pelagic compartments of food webs differs between the Lofoten-Vesterålen region and the North Sea, and therefore food webs might be affected differently by environmental changes (Krause et al., 2003). Top predators feed either from pelagic or benthic trophic channels in Lofoten-Vesterålen, while the only top predator (G. morhua) in the North Sea feeds from both channels.

The high structural similarity in both North Sea food webs indicates that the northern North Sea undergoes a similar mesopredator release (fish or invertebrate) if the cod stock decreases due to overfishing or climate change. Also, the presence of very low numbers of Gadus morhua in the southern North Sea has shifted the ecosystem toward a flatfish dominated community, along with particularly high abundances of small, demersal, mesopredatory fish (B. luteum, Arnoglossus laterna, A. cataphractus, Pomatoschistus spp.) (Daan et al., 2005; Ehrich et al., 2007; van Hal et al., 2010). However, the situation in the Lofoten-Vesterålen region is different, with the collapse of a single species not being expected to have such an extreme effect on the system. Both, the pelagic and benthic channels sustain a larger number of species that could fill an opening niche, which indicates that the region has a higher resilience towards high fishing pressure. Furthermore, differences between fjord and shelf were limited to individual species in the Lofoten-Vesterålen region and no overall structural difference was identified."

","Furthermore, our data indicate that the recent mesopredator outburst in the southern North Sea might have been enhanced by reduced predation pressure due to the collapse of the local cod stocks.",Task 5.3 Predicting changes in fisheries distribution ,Gadus morhua,adults,bentho-pelagic,research survey,Other,Niskin bottle,Fishing,abundance,Fishing,No,,,,"spatial only: distribution, mapping, static ",visualization/maps,visualization/maps,Yes,"This study suggests that the collapse of the Gadus morhua stock in the southern North Sea has enhanced the mesopredator outburst in the region. The high structural similarity in both North Sea food webs indicates that the northern North Sea undergoes a similar mesopredator release (fish or invertebrate) if the cod stock decreases due to overfishing or climate change. Also, the presence of very low numbers of Gadus morhua in the southern North Sea has shifted the ecosystem toward a flatfish dominated community, along with particularly high abundances of small, demersal, mesopredatory fish (B. luteum, Arnoglossus laterna, A. cataphractus, Pomatoschistus spp.) (Daan et al., 2005; Ehrich et al., 2007; van Hal et al., 2010). However, the situation in the Lofoten-Vesterålen region is different, with the collapse of a single species not being expected to have such an extreme effect on the system. Both, the pelagic and benthic channels sustain a larger number of species that could fill an opening niche, which indicates that the region has a higher resilience towards high fishing pressure. Furthermore, differences between fjord and shelf were limited to individual species in the Lofoten-Vesterålen region and no overall structural difference was identified."

In commercial fisheries attention is increasingly directed to species historically being of secondary importance and potentially being influenced by these drivers. We present long-term commercial fisheries data of North Sea whiting (Merlangius merlangus), comprising international catches (1903-2010), quotas (1980-2010), and British otter trawler data (landings-per-unit-effort (lpue) for 1923-2009 at the spatial scale of ICES rectangles). Based on lpue data, we tested the possible effects of climate change and fishing pressure on whiting distribution. Results showed no distinct latitudinal and deepening shifts, but a similar to 1 degrees westward shift between the late-1940s and 1960s. Relations to climate change and fishing pressure were not strong. The lack of clear latitudinal and deepening shifts contrasts with recent studies another North Sea species reporting such shifts related to temperature change. The North Sea is at the centre of the distribution range of whiting, and the temperature changes might still fall well within the physiological tolerance limits of this species, hence not affecting the distribution. The drivers for the longitudinal shift remain unclear. However, whiting is also commonly discarded by fisheries; if levels of discarding differ spatially, our results may not represent the true picture of whiting distribution and need to be interpreted with caution. This highlights the challenge in detection and attribution of climate change effects on exploited fish stocks with commercial data only. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

While tactical management is still dominated by single-species models that do not explicitly account for these drivers, more holistic ecosystem models are used in strategic management. One way forward in this regard is with individual-based models (IBMs), which provide a single framework in which these drivers can be represented explicitly. We present a generic marine fish IBM that incorporates spatial and temporal variation in food availability, temperature and exploitation. Key features of the model are that it (1) includes realistic energy budgets; (2) includes the full life cycle of fish; (3) is spatially-explicit and (4) incorporates satellite remote-sensing data to represent the environmental drivers. The rates at which individuals acquire and use energy depend on local food availability and temperature. Their state variables, including life stage, size and energy reserves, are updated daily, from which population structure and dynamics emerge. To demonstrate the use of the model we calibrate it for mackerel (Scomber scombrus) in the North East Atlantic. Most parameters are taken from the literature, except the background early mortality rate and the strength predator density dependence, which were estimated by fitting the model to data using Approximate Bayesian Computation. The calibrated model successfully matches the available data on mackerel population dynamics and structure. We demonstrate the use of the model for management purposes by simulating the population effects of opening and closing a sector of the North Sea to mackerel fishing.

Each trawler operated in different fishing grounds (FGs), located off Northern Tunisia, South of Sicily, Malta Islands and in South Levant, for which different exploitation levels are reported. The overall length-frequency distribution (LFD) was constructed, and fishing impact indices (length as percentage of LFD, optimum and maximum length, percentage of mega-spawners and total mortality/von Bertalanffy curvature ratio) were calculated. In spite of an overall acceptable status (juveniles, matures and mega-spawners were present in the catch), sampling data revealed significant differences in LFD shape and status indices between FGs. Those FGs traditionally considered more exploited (Northern Tunisia and South of Sicily) showed a dominance of juveniles, a rarefaction of mega-spawners, a reduction in maximum and asymptotic length and a higher Z/K ratio. Considering the general homogeneity of Mediterranean deep-water habitats, the pelagic dispersal of eggs and the poor swimming capabilities of silver roughy, the present results indicated that deep-water trawling may induce a slow and subtle, although significant, erosion of the older, late maturing and slow growing component of the stocks in the Mediterranean (so-called longevity-overfishing).",English,Article,,Web of Science,K,CS - Mediterranean,">100,000",five year,">100,000",year,Fisheries Dependent Data,Sampling catch data and tracking cohorts,1,1,1,"A final comment concerns the present deep limit of 1000 m for trawling established by the European Union (Council Regulation–EC–No 51/2006), which seems not precautionary, at least for the silver roughly stocks investigated in the present work","Deep-water fishing activity may progressively shift the LFD towards younger fish (that do not have the same productivity per unit biomass as older fish; Beamish et al., 2006), as well as reducing the number of adults and, hence, losing their heterozygous traits","Task 5.4.

Fishing location choice is considered to be a dynamic process whereby trawlers chose from among a repertoire of plastic strategies that they modify if their gains fall below a fixed proportion of the mean gains of the fleet as a whole. The distribution of fishing across different areas of a fishery follows an approximate ideal free distribution (IFD) with varying noise due to uncertainty. The least-productive areas are not utilised because initial net input never reaches the mean yield of better areas subject to competitive exploitation. In cases, where there is a weak temporal autocorrelation between fish stocks in a specific location, a plastic strategy of local translocation between trawls mixed with longer-range translocation increases realised input. The trawler can change its translocation strategy in the light of information about recent trawling success compared to its long-term average but, in contrast to predictions of the Marginal Value Theorem (MVT) model, does not know for certain what it will find by moving, so may need to sample new patches. The combination of the two types of translocation mirrored beam-trawling strategies used by the Dutch fleet and the resultant distribution of trawling effort is confirmed by analysis of historical effort distribution of British otter trawling fleets in the North Sea.

The purpose of this study is to mathematically determine local and regional patterns of ecological change within an LME using empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs). After using EOFs to define regions with distinct patterns of change, a statistical model originating from control theory is applied (Nonlinear AutoRegressive Moving Average with eXogenous input - NARMAX) to assess potential drivers of change within these regions. We have selected spatial data sets (0.5 degrees latitudex1 degrees longitude) of fish abundance from North Sea fisheries research surveys (spanning 1980-2008) as well as of temperature, oxygen, net primary production and a fishing pressure proxy, to which we apply the EOF and NARMAX methods. Two regions showed significant changes since 1980: the central North Sea displayed a decrease in community size structure which the NARMAX model suggested was linked to changes in fishing; and the Norwegian trench region displayed an increase in community size structure which, as indicated by NARMAX results, was primarily linked to changes in sea-bottom temperature. These regions were compared to an area of no change along the eastern Scottish coast where the model determined the community size structure was most strongly associated to net primary production. This study highlights the multifaceted effects of environmental change and fishing pressures in different regions of the North Sea.

Our results revealed strong spatial structuring and long-term changes in the trait composition of North Sea fish, with temporal changes not being uniformly distributed in space. Among the environmental drivers investigated, depth was one of the best predictors, primarily explaining the spatial variation in lifespan, growth rate, trophic level and fecundity.

A multi-table analysis (STATICO-CoA) evidenced a strong inter-GSAs stability in the organization of assemblages, with specificities for some GSAs. The most stable structuring factors were linked to combined gradients of chlorophyll a, phytoplancton carbon biomass and temperature, inversely correlated with depth, salinity and nutrient gradients (axis 1 of the STATICO-CoA compromise, 93.74% of the total variability). A common pattern linking the distribution of species to these environmental gradients was evidenced for most of the 17 GSAs.

The wide spatial distribution of hake and the lack of knowledge of some processes involved in its spatial dynamics could hamper the assessment and management of hake. To help understand the processes, we implemented a spatial version of the Stock Synthesis stock assessment model for northern hake, including available data on this stock and the associated fisheries. For the 1978-2012 time series, the model distinguished the Bay of Biscay, the Celtic Sea and a northern area aggregating the West of Scotland and the North Sea. The model considered an age-structured population for each age class and area, a seasonal migration, global recruitment allocated to areas and fishing fleets for each area. Parameters for stock and exploitation spatio-temporal dynamics were estimated by likelihood maximization for each quarter and area. The comparison of spatial and non spatial models goodness of fit showed they were close, although the fit to abundance indices slightly improved with the spatial model. Fishing mortalities, spawning stock biomasses and recruitments were slightly different from the current assessment model estimates, essentially at the beginning and the end of the time series. On average over the time series, fishing mortality estimates relative to the abundance were higher in the Bay of Biscay than elsewhere, spawning stock biomass estimates were higher in the Celtic Sea than elsewhere, and recruitment occurred mainly in the Bay of Biscay.

Sensitivity to fishing increases along a fast-to-slow gradient of life history strategies, and the slow species (large, long-lived, late-maturing, giving birth to few large offspring) require the most time to recover from fishing. In the North East Atlantic, after having reached extreme levels, fishing pressure has decreased since the 1980's due to management measures such as total allowable catch (TAC) or area closure. An effect on the distribution of species as well as a potential recovery could be expected. However, temporal patterns of life history strategies are rarely linked to management measures. In addition, a larger emphasis is often put on exploited or emblematic sensitive species but rarely on assembly processes at the ecosystem scale (both commercial and non-commercial species). Based on a 17-year time series of 101 taxa (fishes, elasmobranchs, bivalves, cephalopods and crustaceans), we observed a negative relationship between the biomass of taxa sensitive to fishing and bottom trawling pressure, as well as an increase in their total biomass in the Celtic Sea. Over the whole area, stochasticity appeared as the dominant assembly process. Deterministic assembly processes were at play in the centre of the area where significant overdispersion (caused by the presence of both slow and fast taxa) were observed. The absence of sensitive taxa from the rest of the Celtic Sea appeared to be caused mainly by a historical effect of environmental filtering when fishing was high.

A novel approach that combines the spatial analysis of fishing gradients (based on vessel monitoring system records) with distance-based linear models was used to assess the response of several functional and structural metrics of fish assemblages to gradients of trawling, within four distinct habitat types. In addition, critical thresholds of trawling intensity were identified for the most sensitive metrics through piecewise regression models. Overall, total biomass and dominance (i.e. number of species that make up 90% of the total biomass) metrics as well as metrics representing vulnerable features (such as chondrichthyes, species with very low resilience and sedentary species) were shown to be sensitive to fishing. Our results suggest that decreasing trends in these indicators are likely to be associated with direct and indirect fishing effects acting synergistically on specific features of fish assemblages leading to its homogenization, with likely impacts on ecosystems resilience. Critical thresholds at high, medium and low fishing intensity levels were identified depending on the metric used to assess fishing impacts, suggesting that it is difficult to define a single global target for fishing management as it ultimately will depend on management and conservation objectives (e.g. maintenance of biomass vs. maintenance of structure and function).

While numerous studies have documented changes in species' distributions and abundances in response to warming [1, 2], the consequences for the functional structure of ecosystems (i.e., composition of species' functional traits) have received less attention. Here, using thirty years of fish monitoring, we show that two connected North Atlantic ecosystems (E. English Channel and S. North Sea) underwent a rapid shift in functional structure triggered by a climate oscillation to a prevailing warm-phase in the late-1990s. Using time-lag-based causality analyses, we found that rapid warming drove pelagic fishes with r-selected life history traits (e.g., low age and size at maturity, small offspring, low trophic level) to shift abruptly northward from one ecosystem to the other, causing an inversion in functional structure between the two connected ecosystems. While we observed only a one-year time-lag between the climate oscillation and the functional shift, indicating rapid responses to a changing environment, historical overfishing likely rendered these ecosystems susceptible to climatic stress [3], and declining fishing in the North Sea may have exacerbated the shift. This shift likely had major consequences for ecosystem functioning due to potential changes in biomass turnover, nutrient cycling, and benthic-pelagic coupling [4-6 ].

activity is a key issue for sustainable management of trawling fishery

Cumulative vulnerability of EUNIS habitat of the best nursery area are highest in Malaga Bay, where trawling frequency should be reduced 30–60 times to achieve sustainable trawling frequency. Malaga Bay lacks protection, and a fishery reserve (Baro et al., 2015, this study) is proposed there to guarantee the habitat's capacity to support ecosystem services (supporting and provisioning services). Because of the present conflict among activities, there is a high probability of elevated conflicts among MPAs, trawling, extraction and AQ. Upcoming blue growth industries (AQ and OWFs) can double the conflict potential, especially in coastal waters where MPAs, trawling, AQ and extraction coincide. Future installation of OWFs enters in conflict with offshore shipping and migration corridors of great pelagic predators. To achieve sustainable development of the Alboran Sea, integrated spatial management approaches including trawling, AQ, marine transport and OWFs considering co-location of activities are proposed for the North Alboran Sea in general and particularly for Malaga Bay."

Female LFDs were correlated up to a range of 15 km and males up to 25 km. Cluster analysis of the LFDs, interpreted taking into account the autocorrelation length scales, indicated two to three main clusters of geographically connected stations for male LFDs and smaller clusters with weaker spatial contiguity of stations in the case of female LFDs. Inter cluster differences in median length, mean weight, range in length, size at putative ages 2 and 3 and the proportion of mature females were apparent. These parameters reliably classified over 80% of stations to their respective clusters in a direct discriminant analysis. The biological characteristics were partially dependent on sediment grain size composition as shown by a canonical correlation analysis. Median length, mean weight, size at ages 2 and 3 and the percentage of females that were mature were all negatively correlated with finer sediments.

Apparently, mean carapace length is at a minimum and biomass at a maximum when the silt clay content is between 40 and 80%. The mechanism linking slow growth to areas of finer sediment in the Irish Sea is unclear. The correlation may not represent a direct cause-effect but could be linked through other factors such as density dependant effects on growth or the effects of spatially variable temperature on growth. There is also the probability of spatially variable fishing pressure. Fishing pressure estimated for stations on an east-west transect on the grid by Tully et al.

The potential fecundity (the stock of vitellogenic oocytes in the pre-spawning ovary), egg size (diameter and dry weight of artificially fertilized 1-day-old eggs) and gonad dry weight were assessed for fish sampled in SD 25 and SD 28. Multiple regression analysis identified somatic weight, or total length in combination with Fulton's condition factor, as main predictors of fecundity and gonad dry weight with stage of maturity (oocyte packing density or leading cohort) as an additional predictor. For egg size, somatic weight was identified as main predictor while otolith weight (proxy for age) was an additional predictor. Univariate analysis using GLM revealed significantly higher fecundity and gonad dry weight for turbot from SD 28 (3378-3474 oocytes/g somatic weight) compared to those from SD 25 (2343 oocytes/g somatic weight), with no difference in egg size (1.05 +/- 0.03 mm diameter and 46.8 +/- 6.5 mu g dry weight; mean +/- sd). The difference in egg production matched egg survival probabilities in relation to salinity conditions suggesting selection for higher fecundity as a consequence of poorer reproductive success at lower salinities. This supports the hypothesis of higher size-specific fecundity towards the limit of the distribution of a species as an adaptation to harsher environmental conditions and lower offspring survival probabilities. Within SD 28 comparisons were made between two major fishing areas targeting spawning aggregations and a marine protected area without fishing. The outcome was inconclusive and is discussed with respect to potential fishery induced effects, effects of the salinity gradient, effects of specific year-classes, and effects of maturation status of sampled fish.

in accordance to salinity conditions (Nissling et al., 2006). Analysis revealed significant differences in the potential fecundity between turbot from ICES SD 25 and SD 28 with higher size-specific fecundity for fish from SD 28 but with no difference in egg size. The
higher allocation of resources into gonad production was balanced by
lower growth. The difference in fecundity matched egg survival probabilities in relation to salinity conditions suggesting selection for higher fecundity as a consequence of poorer reproductive success at lower salinities. The outcome of the analysis suggested difficulties in separating fishery-induced effects from salinity adaptations in the Baltic Sea. Fishing mortality involves both phenotypic and genotypic changes (summarized by Rochet, 2009); evolutionary changes in life history traits may induce an increase in reproductive investment (gonad weight and fecundity) balanced by a decreased growth rate. This
means that populations subject to high fishing mortality can be expected to display an increased size specific fecundity and decreased size at maturity. 
","Assessment of fecundity of fish sampled in 2007 vs. 2010 yielded
considerably lower estimates, ~30%, when full manual counting was
performed. This inter-annual discrepancy cannot be due to differences in fish condition, as fish were found to be in similar condition in 2007 and 2010, but to methodological shortcomings.","Task 5.4.

By the early 2000s, high fishing mortality had resulted in truncated size-structure of the stock and decreased CPUEs (Fiskeriverket, 2010). The comparison of size-specific fecundity, was inconclusive, between the two major fishing areas (HB and EG) and the unfished marine protected area (GS). The samples obtained in 2007 suggested a higher size-specific fecundity (~ 13%) at the GS area compared to the fished areas, showing a potential selection for later maturation and thus at a larger size, accompanied with lower fecundity an effect of an intense spawning fishery as discussed in Rochet (2009). The pattern observed in 2007 may also be the cause of the decrease in salinity towards the north. Hence, the authors suggest that turbot from SD 25 and SD 28, should be managed as two separate stocks."

However, it is largely unknown how dredging affects fish communities. In this study patterns and impacts of fish bycatch in scallop dredges around the Isle of Man, in the north Irish Sea, were investigated by analysing data from fisheries-independent surveys conducted between 1992 and 2005. Almost all (97.6%) tows of the survey gear generated fish bycatch, with a total of approximately 50 species recorded. Cuckoo ray (Leucoraja naevus) and monkfish (Lophius piscatorius) dominated the bycatch, accounting for 46.82% of the total. Three other species of particular commercial or ecological interest; lemon sole (Microstomus kitt), plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and lesser spotted dogfish (Scyliorhinus caniculus), were also abundant. Most of the cuckoo ray, monkfish and plaice captured were juveniles, whereas lesser spotted dogfish and lemon sole were a mixture of juveniles and adults. In general, rates of fish bycatch appeared low, but this may be at least partly because background fish densities around the Isle of Man were also low. There was considerable spatial, temporal, and species-specific variation in fish bycatch, and the finer meshed dredges traditionally used to catch queen scallops (Aequipecten opercularis), caught significantly more fish than the great scallop (Pecten maximus) dredges. The density of lesser spotted dogfish bycatch increased significantly over the 14?years of the study whereas the density of monkfish decreased significantly. These patterns appear to reflect differences in the susceptibility of the two species to capture and damage by scallop dredging, and/or have been caused by regional trends in stock levels. An assessment of the impact of the local great scallop dredge fishery indicated that it may be catching substantial numbers of monkfish. Given the recent expansion of scallop dredging around the UK, such effects should be factored into ecosystem-based management plans.Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",English,Article,,Web of Science,K,CS - Western Waters,"50,000-100,000",decade,"5,000-10,000",quarter,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey,"ANOVA, Kruskal Wallis, Kolomogorov Smirnov",2,2,3,"it is likely that low rates of fish bycatch were at least partly because background fish densities around the Isle of Man were also low'

The system consists currently of three mathematically, fundamentally different model subsystems coupled offline: POLCOMS providing the physical environment implemented in the domain of the north-west European shelf, the SPAM model which describes sandeel stocks in the North Sea, and the third component, the SLAM model, which connects POLCOMS and SPAM by computing the physical-biological interaction. Our major experience by the coupling model subsystems is that well-defined and generic model interfaces are very important for a successful and extendable coupled model framework. The integrated approach, simulating ecosystem dynamics from physics to fish, allows for analysis of the pathways in the ecosystem to investigate the propagation of changes in the ocean climate and to quantify the impacts on the higher trophic level, in this case the sandeel population, demonstrated here on the basis of hindcast data. The coupled forecasting system is tested for some typical scientific questions appearing in spatial fish stock management and marine spatial planning, including determination of local and basin-scale maximum sustainable yield, stock connectivity and source/sink structure. Our presented simulations indicate that sandeel stocks are currently exploited close to the maximum sustainable yield, even though periodic over-fishing seems to have occurred, but large uncertainty is associated with determining stock maximum sustainable yield due to stock inherent dynamics and climatic variability. Our statistical ensemble simulations indicates that the predictive horizon set by climate interannual variability is 2-6 yr, after which only an asymptotic probability distribution of stock properties, like biomass, are predictable.",English,Article,,Web of Science,K,CS - North Sea,">100,000",multidecadal,"5,000-10,000",year,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey,Simulation,3,2,3,"We see that there are significant differ- ences between habitats that contribute and receive recruits on small scales, i.e. the stock dynamics on a small scale are strongly dependent on the exchange of larvae between nearby habitats._We see that the route of stock collapse is gradual when in-creasing fishing pressures: the stock concentrates in the most

Moreover, the fisheries yield is quantified and analyzed in terms of landings with respect to official management area of registration of vessels. In this way, the real area of activity of each fleet is not considered and this prevent an effective spatial analysis of the factors affecting fisheries yield and stocks status. This paper firstly presents a VMS-based reconstruction of the fishing effort and of the area of activity of the Italian trawlers in the Mediterranean Sea. The fishing area of each fleet is then used as a spatial reference to estimate primary productivity rate and gross primary production and to investigate, by using General Additive Models, the effects of trawling effort, primary production and time on fisheries yield, fisheries productivity and overexploitation rate for some key demersal species. The results evidence that the usage of satellite-based information of fishing activities and of primary production, when combined at the real spatial scale of fishing activities, could effectively improve our ability to analyze the response of the ecosystems to these driving forces and allow capturing the main trends of yield, productivity and overexploitation rate of demersal stocks.",English,Article,,Web of Science,K,CS - Mediterranean,">100,000",decade,"1,000-5,000",subday,Fisheries Dependent Data,GAM,3,3,2,The relationship between gross primary production and landings of demersal species has an asymptotic shape_[…] the wide area exploited by trawlers supports an important gross primary production,,Task 5.3 Predicting changes in fisheries distribution ,Various,unknown,demersal,Commercial,Demersal trawls,Otter trawl,Fishing,other (fishing yield),Fishing,Yes,catch,Negative,not clear,"spatiotemporal: dynamic, movement, allocation, shift, migration, displacement (e.g. by depth)",regression analysis,"GAM based on spatial fishing effort (VMS & AIS) data, as well as primary productivity",No,The effect of nominal fishing effort (NE) on fishing yield is analyzed in the impact analysis

The data collection of commercial fisheries has been formalized by the EU data collection framework (DCF). Besides gaining relevant information to fisheries management under the Common Fisheries Policy, the data of the DCF will gain importance in assessing the impacts of fishing on the ecosystem of the Baltic Sea.

The catch of the demersal German Baltic Sea trawl fleet between 2006 and 2009 was sampled by on-board observers to investigate the temporal and spatial patterns in catch composition. Results. There was a general increment in tow duration, landing weights, and discard weights from west to east. The most important species by catch weight was cod, for which highest catches were obtained during spring in ICES subdivision 25. Single hauls exceeded 25 h and caught more than 9900 kg of cod. On average, about 5%, 13%, and 20% and of the captured cod, flounder, and dab, respectively, were discarded. Conclusion.

Although several discard models have been recently developed, current approaches are still unable to robustly adjust to different circumstances (e.g. fishery target species, geographical location), and lack a closer interaction with stakeholders. Here, we present a novel approach consisting of a modular Bayesian model, which can incorporate any relevant explanatory variable, independently of data availability. The relationships between the variables and discard rates are initially delineated by stakeholders through surveys, and included to the model as priors. The priors are then used together with observed data for estimating posterior distributions of discard probability. We test this approach in two study areas at the Mediterranean Sea: the Ligurian and Tyrrhenian Seas in Italy, and the Greek part of the Aegean Sea. For each site, we evaluated the model for estimating discards from bottom trawl fishery associated with European minimum conservation reference size regulations, as well as discards caused by the low economic value of catches.

Over the entire period, the LFI has decreased in large parts of the North Sea. However, most of the decline was from 1983-1999; since 2000 the LFI has improved in much of the North Sea, especially in UK waters. Comparison with international effort data shows that those western areas where the LFI has improved correspond with regions where otter trawl effort has decreased since 2000 (and previously was highest in the 1990s), and also with decreases in beam trawl effort.

Studies of North Sea plaice in the early 1900s first documented this phenomenon (named Heincke's law); it occurred at a time of intensive harvesting and rapid technological changes in fishing methods. The possibility that this deepening might be the result of harvesting has never been evaluated. Instead, age-or size-related deepening have been credited to interactions between density-dependent food resources and density-independent environmental factors. Recently, time-dependent depth variations have been ascribed to ocean warming. We use a model, initialized from observations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) on the eastern Scotian Shelf, where an age-dependent deepening of similar to 60 m was observed, to assess the effect of size-and depth-selective exploitation on fish distribution. Exploitation restricted to the upper 80 m can account for similar to 72% of the observed deepening; by extending exploitation to 120 m, all of the deepening can be accounted for. In the absence of fishing, the model indicated no age-related deepening. Observations of depth distributions of older cod during a moratorium on fishing supported this prediction; however, younger cod exhibited low-amplitude deepening (10-15 m) suggestive of an ontogenetic response. The implications of these findings are manifold, particularly as they relate to hypotheses advanced to explain the ecological and evolutionary basis for ontogenetic deepening and to recent calls for the adoption of evidence of species deepening as a biotic indicator or footprint of warming seas.",English,Article,"hybrid, Green Published",Web of Science,K,Global,">100,000",multidecadal,"50,000-100,000",multidecadal,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey,,3,,3,,"Various regions including North East Atlantic, and species in a litt review, but main case study in the paper is cod from eastern scotia ",Task 5.2 Predicting species distribution ,Gadus morhua,juv and adults,demersal,research survey,Demersal trawls,Bottom trawl,Fishing,occurrence,Fishing,Yes,Size/ age structure,Positive,not clear,"spatiotemporal: dynamic, movement, allocation, shift, migration, displacement (e.g. by depth)",,1D analysis : center of mass of the depth distribution by age through time ,No,

Where necessary information was lacking, assumptions were made, and a sensitivity analysis performed to examine the impact of these issues on model results. Model outcomes were validated using international landings and discard data for five target species: cod, haddock, whiting, sole, and plaice. This showed that depending on its configuration, the model could reproduce recorded landings and discards of these species reasonably well. This suggests that the model could be used to simulate rates of fishing mortality for non-target fish species, for which few data are currently available. Sensitivity analyses revealed that model outcomes were most strongly influenced by the estimates of gear catch efficiency and the extent to which the distributions of fishing effort and each species overlapped.

Fisheries modify the structure and functioning of food-webs through biomass removal and physical damage to the seabed, leading to loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services provided by the oceans. The ecosystem-based approach to fisheries is considered the most efficient way to achieve the goal of sustainable use of marine resources while allowing for biodiversity protection. The Strait of Sicily is a biologically important area of the central Mediterranean Sea characterized by high habitat complexity and rich biodiversity, however, due to the multispecific nature of local fisheries and weak implementation of the adopted management plans, this region is particularly vulnerable. We used fishery independent time series (1994-2016) to identify the main demersal assemblages and map their spatial distribution. The pressure of fishing effort on each of these defined assemblages was then quantified in order to evaluate the impact of bottom trawling on demersal communities. Our results showed four spatially distinct and temporally stable assemblages of the Strait of Sicily. These have a clear spatial distribution, different species composition and biodiversity values and are driven primarily by environmental gradients (i.e., mainly depth and, to a lesser extent, surface salinity). The demersal assemblages were subsequently grouped in homogeneous areas characterized by specific communities of commercial and non-commercial species and response to trawling impacts.

The results show that fishing plays an important role in shaping the spatial distribution of the two species.

A life cycle approach was used to quantify the relative influence of these stressors on the Eastern English Channel (EEC) population of the common sole (Solea solea), a coastal-nursery dependent flatfish population which sustains important fisheries. The common sole has a complex life cycle: after eggs hatch, larvae spend several weeks drifting in open water. Survivors go on to metamorphose into benthic fish. Juveniles spend the first two years of their life in coastal and estuarine nurseries. Close to maturation, they migrate to deeper areas, where different subpopulations supplied by different nurseries reproduce and are exploited by fisheries. A spatially structured age-and stage-based hierarchical Bayesian model integrating various aspects of ecological knowledge, data sources and expert knowledge was built to quantitatively describe this complex life cycle. The model included the low connectivity among three subpopulations in the EEC, the influence of hydrographic variability, the availability of suitable juvenile habitat and fisheries. Scenarios were designed to quantify the effects of interacting stressors on population renewal. Results emphasized the importance of coastal nursery habitat availability and quality for the population renewal. Realistic restoration scenarios of the highly degraded Seine estuary produced a two-third increase in catch potential for the adjacent subpopulation. Fisheries, however, remained the main source of population depletion. Setting fishing mortality to the maximum sustainable yield led to substantial increases in biomass (+100%) and catch (+33%) at the EEC scale. The approach also showed how climate-driven variability in hydrography is likely to interact with human pressures, e.g., overfishing increased the sensitivity to unfavourable conditions. Our results provided insights into the dynamics of numerous exploited coastal-nursery-dependent species while paving the way toward more robust advice for sustainable management of these resources.

We applied the bioeconomic model FishRent to understand the response of eight fleets operating in the Northeast Atlantic mackerel and North Sea autumn spawning herring fishery to a number of scenarios, including changes in recruitment, the quota allocation key, and disruptions in fish and fuel prices. In all scenarios, both the Irish and German fleets were close to the break-even point, making them more vulnerable to additional disturbances than other fleets. Yet, these events are expected to occur simultaneously and a larger margin between costs and revenue would enhance the fleets resilience. The replacement of the historical quota allocation key to countries by an allocation according to biomass distribution negatively affected the German fleet most (-450% profitable within 1 year from 2020 to 2021), followed by the Dutch and Danish fleets (-175% profitable on average among those fleets), while the United Kingdom and Ireland increased their profitability by more than 250%. The differences among fleets highlights the sensitivity of a historical allocation key revision. In case of a continued herring recruitment failure, the profitability of most fleets targeting herring decreased but none of the fleets had to disinvest. Declines in fish prices (16% for frozen mackerel and herring, 81% for fresh herring, and 105% for fresh mackerel on average) and increases in fuel prices (17% on average) forced the United Kingdom, Icelandic, and large-scale (>40 m) Irish fleets to reduce their number of vessels by up to 40%.",English,Article,"gold, Green Published",Web of Science,K,CS - North Sea,">100,000",two year,">100,000",quarter,Fisheries Dependent Data,Bio-economic model,2,2,3,"In all scenarios, both the Irish and German

The climate scenarios comprise projections of SST and chlorophyll from an earth system model GFDL-ESM-2M under assumptions of high (RCP 2.6) and low (RCP 8.5) climate change mitigation action.

Our results suggest that, over the range of scenarios considered, fishing mortality has a larger effect than climate out to 2050. This result is evident in terms of stock size and spatial distribution in the summer months.

Within fishing scenarios the IBM predicts highest SSB, and hence catch, under RCP 8.5. This is largely down to the positive relationship between SST and recruitment included in the stock-recruitment model. Recruitment is almost always positively correlated with temperature for species inhabiting the cooler regions of their thermal niche (Myers, 1998). So, while the western component of the NEAM stock continues to spawn in cooler regions than e.g., the southern component, the sign of this relationship is likely to hold. This could have important implications for the NEAM fishery if warming waters make sustainable management easier. However, such inferences should be made with extreme caution because we do not know if this positive relationship will break down as waters warm. At some temperature the relationship will shift from positive to negative and this is not accounted for in our IBM (because we are not able to establish the limit from historical data). If the positive effect of temperature on recruitment ceases due to warming in the North East Atlantic over the time period considered, then our projections may be optimistic.","Projections of SST from the CMIP ensemble begin to diverge around the mid-twenty-first century (Hutchings et al., 2012), and the same is true for the projections used here.

Here, we review the present knowledge about (i) recent trends in the abundance of plaice and cod in these habitats and (ii) hypotheses regarding the factors responsible for any trends. At present, only a few studies exist on the trends of abundance of plaice or cod, namely from the Bay of Biscay, the North Sea and the Skagerrak/Kattegat. They suggest a declining abundance in coastal, shallow areas and - at least for plaice - a latitudinal gradient with an erosion of the southern distribution boundary in the Bay of Biscay and deepening of stocks in the North Sea. In contrast, no trend in shallow water abundance of plaice similar to a decline in deep-water stocks during the 1970s and their slow recovery during the 2000s is apparent in the Skagerrak/Kattegat. Although shallow habitats fundamentally differ from deeper areas by the prevalence of juvenile stages, the declining trends coincide with decreasing abundance/landings and spatial stock relocations in the deeper areas. Whether this indicates a common trend pointing at connectivity between shallow and deep water remains open. Fundamental differences exist in the suggested causes of the trends in different geographical areas. High fishing pressure together with low local recruitment apparently prevents the recovery of overexploited plaice and cod stocks in the Skagerrak/Kattegat. In contrast, the responses of juveniles and adult fish to increasing seawater temperature are the main hypotheses for changes in distribution and abundance of both fish species in the North Sea/Bay of Biscay. However, temperature alone cannot explain the observed decline of fish in coastal areas, and the causes may be more complex, involving nutrient loading, primary productivity or food availability, although at present, knowledge of these factors is insufficient.",English,Review,,Web of Science,K,CS - North Sea,">100,000",decade,"5,000-10,000",,Fisheries Dependent Data,,,,,"The various factors causing the changing trends in abundance and distribution in near-shore and also offshore shelf waters are not fully understood at present. Although common factors such as temperature or fisheries are often invoked as major factors in both coastal and offshore areas, changes will affect the different age groups in the habitats differently. Fundamental differences apparently exist in the significant variables identified for changes in plaice and cod abundance in the North Sea and the Skagerrak/Kattegat. In the latter, a continuously high fishing pressure, together with a strong dependence of local recruitment on transport from the North Sea, seemingly prevents the recovery of overexploited plaice and cod stocks (e.g. Cardinale et al. 2011; Bartolino et al. 2012). At present, however, it is unclear whether this affects inshore and offshore abundance of juveniles similarly. In contrast, changes in distribution and abundance in the North Sea are largely attributed to changing environmental factors (Tulp et al. 2008; Dulvy et al. 2008; Simpson et al. 2011). In particular, direct and indirect responses of juvenile and adult fish to increasing seawater temperature dominate the present discussion on the causative effects. ","Several observations, however, question a prevailing role of temperature as the single determinant of the observed changes in plaice abundance and distribution, and point to an interplay with other factors such as food availability or competition.

Here, we review the present knowledge about (i) recent trends in the abundance of plaice and cod in these habitats and (ii) hypotheses regarding the factors responsible for any trends. At present, only a few studies exist on the trends of abundance of plaice or cod, namely from the Bay of Biscay, the North Sea and the Skagerrak/Kattegat. They suggest a declining abundance in coastal, shallow areas and - at least for plaice - a latitudinal gradient with an erosion of the southern distribution boundary in the Bay of Biscay and deepening of stocks in the North Sea. In contrast, no trend in shallow water abundance of plaice similar to a decline in deep-water stocks during the 1970s and their slow recovery during the 2000s is apparent in the Skagerrak/Kattegat. Although shallow habitats fundamentally differ from deeper areas by the prevalence of juvenile stages, the declining trends coincide with decreasing abundance/landings and spatial stock relocations in the deeper areas. Whether this indicates a common trend pointing at connectivity between shallow and deep water remains open. Fundamental differences exist in the suggested causes of the trends in different geographical areas. High fishing pressure together with low local recruitment apparently prevents the recovery of overexploited plaice and cod stocks in the Skagerrak/Kattegat. In contrast, the responses of juveniles and adult fish to increasing seawater temperature are the main hypotheses for changes in distribution and abundance of both fish species in the North Sea/Bay of Biscay. However, temperature alone cannot explain the observed decline of fish in coastal areas, and the causes may be more complex, involving nutrient loading, primary productivity or food availability, although at present, knowledge of these factors is insufficient.",English,Review,,Web of Science,K,CS - North Sea,">100,000",decade,"5,000-10,000",,Fisheries Dependent Data,,,,,"The various factors causing the changing trends in abundance and distribution in near-shore and also offshore shelf waters are not fully understood at present. Although common factors such as temperature or fisheries are often invoked as major factors in both coastal and offshore areas, changes will affect the different age groups in the habitats differently. Fundamental differences apparently exist in the significant variables identified for changes in plaice and cod abundance in the North Sea and the Skagerrak/Kattegat. In the latter, a continuously high fishing pressure, together with a strong dependence of local recruitment on transport from the North Sea, seemingly prevents the recovery of overexploited plaice and cod stocks (e.g. Cardinale et al. 2011; Bartolino et al. 2012). At present, however, it is unclear whether this affects inshore and offshore abundance of juveniles similarly. In contrast, changes in distribution and abundance in the North Sea are largely attributed to changing environmental factors (Tulp et al. 2008; Dulvy et al. 2008; Simpson et al. 2011). In particular, direct and indirect responses of juvenile and adult fish to increasing seawater temperature dominate the present discussion on the causative effects. ","Several observations, however, question a prevailing role of temperature as the single determinant of the observed changes in plaice abundance and distribution, and point to an interplay with other factors such as food availability or competition. In the Dutch coastal area, general shifts in species composition and a decrease in demersal fish abundance were related to temperature in the coastal zone only and not in the Wadden Sea, in which the strongest decline in plaice was observed (Tulp et al. 2008; Bolle et al. 2009a).

In parallel, porpoise distribution was positively linked to fish assemblage components representing sandeel and poor cod in summer and flatfish in spring.

The function of such an optimization strategy is to maximize the usability of the sea surface. This article focuses on the pragmatic aspects of marine spatial planning. The authors presuppose a tool for planners that (i) is based on readily available information, is comparable for various countries (ii) and for which the economic interpretation is straightforward and allows for the comparison of fisheries with other sectors. The analysis is based on two pan-European surveys collected under the Common Fisheries Policy. The distribution and catch information is sourced from the Vessel Monitoring System and logbooks, and the economic data come from the national data submissions for the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries. A contribution margin consisting of the difference between the revenue and variable costs at a spatial unit with a 0.05-degree resolution was chosen as the most appropriate indicator for these purposes. A variable costing method can be used to determine the efficiency of maritime sectors in specific spatial units without artificially assigning costs that are unrelated to a given sea area. The analysis covers the period of 2013-2017. Three key areas for Polish fisheries have been identified: the Gulf of Gdansk, the Bornholm Basin, and the Slupsk Furrow; the average contribution margins in these regions were 1133, 651 and 580 EUR/km2, respectively. The variance analysis revealed that the high indicator values were mostly influenced by high catches of sprat and herring fished with pelagic trawls as well as high sprat prices. Fishing with passive gear (gillnets, hooks) and in the 3rd and 4th quarters proved to result in deficits in a large Polish maritime area. The indicators may have been influenced by the lack of data on the individual steaming times, as well as by variations among fuel consumptions and salary costs within fleet segments. Despite these limitations, the method used in this study allows a first attempt at the estimation of the contribution margin and its spatial variation over time in the context of Maritime Spatial Planning needs.

The spatial management of discards has attracted interest as a potential tool for minimizing the unwanted catch. The aim of the present work was to identify areas with high quantities of bottom trawl discarded catch regarding species subjected to MCRS, in six areas of southern European waters (southern Portuguese waters, Catalan Sea, Ligurian and northern Tyrrhenian Seas, Strait of Sicily, eastern Ionian Sea, and Aegean Sea). Analyses were based on two types of data: (a) the undersized catch of species subjected to MCRS from bottom trawl surveys and (b) the actual discarded catch (including undersized and non-undersized individuals) of species subjected to MCRS from commercial bottom trawling. Geostatistical analysis techniques were applied to the first type of data and Generalized Additive Models using environmental variables were applied to the second one. Subsequently, areas that persistently presented high quantities of discarded catch (i.e., iDC grounds) or undersized catch (i.e., iUC grounds) were identified and mapped. The iDC grounds/iUC grounds were located either over the slope or within the continental shelf and over marine plateaus, largely depending on the main target species of each fishery. Next, the overlap of iDC grounds/iUC grounds with the existing Fisheries Restricted Areas (FRAs) and the proposed Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) was estimated aiming to explore how spatial closures could contribute to the reduction of bottom trawl discarded catch/undersized catch. Certain spatial closures were more effective in the Central Mediterranean and others to the Eastern Mediterranean. The overlapping of existing FRAs with iDC grounds/`iUC grounds did not exceed 24 % in any study area, whereas proposed MPAs, like the CIESM Marine Peace Parks, reached up to 90 % for the same study area.",English,Article,,Web of Science,K,CS - Western Waters,">100,000",decade,"50,000-100,000",year,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey,GAM,2,2,3,,,Task 5.5.

Size-based community metrics are potentially useful indicators because of their theoretical foundation and practical utility. Temporal and spatial patterns in size-based community metrics for Celtic Sea fish are described and calculated using data from the English groundfish survey of the area (1987-2003). The results reveal that the size structure of the community has changed over time, and that a decrease in the relative abundance of larger fish was accompanied by an increase in smaller fish (4-25 g). Temporal analyses of the effects of fishing and climate variation suggest that fishing generally has had a stronger effect on size structure than changes in temperature. Therefore, size-based metrics respond clearly to the effects of fishing even in variable environments, reflecting the ubiquity of size-based processes in defining community structure and responses to mortality. Spatial analyses were inconclusive, probably owing to the limited area for which fishing effort, temperature, and survey data were all available.

For data collection, the Adriatic Sea is divided into two management areas (namely FAO Geographical Sub-Areas GSAs). To account for these spatial patterns while using the data available, we propose a method for estimating the monthly landings of Italian trawlers operating in the Adriatic Sea at a higher spatial resolution than the GSA. We use a stepwise approach based on the combined analysis of questionnaire-derived vessel-specific landings and the spatial activity of the vessels with respect to a set of fishing grounds. Thus, we sequentially 1) analyze the available vessel monitoring system data, 2) partition the study area into fishing grounds (the origin of the landings), 3) cross analyze vessel-specific fishing efforts with the available vessel-specific monthly landings to estimate the LPUE of each fishing ground, and 4) estimate the monthly landings (by vessel, fishing ground, and harbor) for the whole fleet and the monthly fluxes between fishing grounds (origin) and landing harbors (the destination of the landings). We apply the method to two species: the Norway lobster and the European hake. For both species, we find a few fishing grounds to be consistently more productive than others and the landings per harbor to vary greatly but with few harbors regularly receiving a significant share. In particular, the results suggest that the Pomo/Jabuka pit area represents a critical area for both species.

We developed a framework to anticipate the cost-effectiveness of several fisheries management options, including space-time closures, gear selectivity improvements, and fishing effort reduction of eastern Ionian Sea fisheries. We also examined to what extent these fisheries could be influenced by placing new aquaculture sites into specific areas. We used a dynamic space-time model considering the effect of possible fishing effort displacement on alternative marine areas. A fine-scale distribution of 6 species of high commercial importance, for the eastern Ionian fisheries (central Mediterranean), was used together with the fishing effort distribution of trawlers, purse-seines, and small-scale fisheries to track the implications on several bio-economic indicators. The study revealed that the stocks and the fisheries economics benefited from a 10% reduction in fishing effort for all fishery sectors, while the unwanted fish catch was slightly higher. Thus, although there are notable advantages, this management option is not sufficient to support an EU regulatory framework aiming to promote more selective fishing practices and mitigate unwanted catches. However, we showed that the protection of juveniles, by imposing selectivity improvements or space-time closures on trawlers, slightly reduced the unwanted catch. Nevertheless, the benefit for the majority of stocks and fisheries economics, during the five-year simulation period, was limited. In the case of spacetime closures, this is attributed to the offset due to the fishing effort displacement towards other areas. While the benefit on fish populations by improving trawl selectivity, it depends on the species. Finally, the establishment of new aquaculture units could lead to a slight re-allocation of fishing effort along the border of the new sites without substantially affecting the profit of small-scale fisheries.

We explored the relative effectiveness of seasonal closures versus size-based landing restrictions using a four-season age-structured model. More than a third of adult thornback rays are currently removed by fishing each year, and without effective management, a further 90% decline within 30 years is likely. A three-season closure of the Thames Estuary was the shortest closure that ensured thornback ray recovery and minimal loss of fishery yield. Minimum and maximum landing size restrictions are nearly as effective at recovering thornback rays but less so at improving yield.

Fish landings from the Baltic and North Sea are shown to be taken from a lower trophic level and are shown to be overall more planktivorous than those from shelf edge regions. The secondary production required per unit of landed fish from the North Sea was approximately half that for landings from the southwest approaches to the UK, referred to as the Celtic Seas, where zooplankton production accounted for only a small fraction of the secondary production demands of the fisheries. In the North Sea, variability in zooplankton production seems to have exerted a bottom-up effect on fish production, which in turn has exerted a top-down effect on the benthos. Conversely, Celtic Seas benthos production has been a bottom-up driver of fish production, which seems to have been independent of variability in plankton production. Thus, climate and fishing pressures call be expected to influence these regional fisheries in very different ways. Overall, the results indicate very strong spatial patterns in the fish foodweb structure and function, which will be important considerations in the establishment of regional management plans for fisheries.

To construct OPFish, we used productivity frontal features derived from chlorophyll-a horizontal gradients, which characterize 10%-20% of the global phytoplankton production that effectively fuels higher trophic levels. OPFish is relatively consistent with the spatial distribution of both pelagic and demersal fish landings and catches per unit of effort (LPUEs and CPUEs, respectively). An index of harvest relative to ocean productivity (H-P index) is calculated by dividing these LPUEs or CPUEs with OPFish. The H-P index reflects the intensity of fishing by gear type with regard to local fish production. Low H-P levels indicate lower LPUEs or CPUEs than expected from oceanic production, suggesting over-exploitation, while high H-P levels imply more sustainable fishing. H-P allows comparing the production-dependent suitability of local fishing intensities. Our results from bottom trawl data highlight that over-exploitation of demersal species from the shelves is twice as high in the Mediterranean Sea than in the North-East Atlantic. The estimate of H-P index by dominant pelagic and demersal gears suggests that midwater and bottom otter trawls are associated with the lowest and highest overfishing, respectively.

Mobile demersal gears had the highest intensity and widest distribution of activity in the study area, and so might be expected to have the most widespread ecosystem-level impacts. The potential effects of two proposed fisheries closures; a planned wave energy testing facility (Wave Hub) and a candidate offshore Marine Protected Area (Haig Fras) are described. Maps indicate that mobile demersal gear fleets would be little affected if they were excluded from these proposed closures, but if the static gear fleets were excluded this would likely result in displacement of certain vessels, increasing fishing pressure on other rocky grounds and other fishers.

The most prominent result was that most fleets fishing near to aggregate extraction sites were not deterred by extraction activities. The fishing effort of dredgers and potters could be greater adjacent to marine aggregates sites than elsewhere, and also positively correlated to extraction intensity with a lag of 0-9 months. The distribution of fishing effort of French netters remained consistent over the study period. However, it is of note that the fishing effort of netters has increased substantially in the impacted area of the Dieppe site (where it is correlated to extraction intensity with a lag of 6 months), while slightly decreasing in the intermediate and reference areas. The attraction of fishing fleets is likely due to a local temporary concentration of their main target species. However, knowledge of their life-history characteristics and habitat preferences suggests that some of these species could be particularly vulnerable to aggregate extractions in the longer term.

Results showed that daily sole landings were up to twice as high just after re-opening of the fishery and dropped within 3 weeks to a reference level.

By applying Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) on records from electronic tags, migration routes of tagged fish can be reconstructed and new insights to the movement ecology of a species can be gained. We demonstrate the usability of HMMs on a widespread, iteroparous salmonid (sea trout, Salmo trutta) in a complex marine area with highly variable temperatures and salinities within small geographic distances. Understanding how the highly adaptable sea trout cope with these complex conditions could shed new light on factors driving the movement ecology of salmonids. Migration tracks of fish migrating at sea are reconstructed by applying an HMM on temperature and depth records from eight wild post-spawned sea trout from four Danish rivers.ResultsThe fish migrated at sea for 47-142 days. Estimated positions of all fish were close to the coast (<100 km) throughout the marine period, but migrations along coastlines up to 580 km away from the natal river occurred. Seven of eight individuals resided in or actively migrated into stratified or shallow marine areas that heat up fast during spring, while all eight individuals resided in deeper and more heterogeneous areas that heat up slow during summer. All fish entered the Skagerrak (located between Denmark and Norway) at some stage during summer. Migrations were directed into less saline areas during the first 15 days at sea for all individuals. Mean linear progression of the fish was 16 km day(-1) (range 0-58 km day(-1)).ConclusionsThe results corroborate the expectation that sea trout are more coastally orientated than other salmonids, but also suggest that longer migrations occur in the seas surrounding Denmark compared to elsewhere. This could be a consequence of the fish seeking out habitats with optimal conditions (e.g. salinity, temperature, predation and foraging options) for growth in different parts of the year. The coinciding movement from shallow or stratified marine areas that heat up fast during spring to deeper, more well-mixed areas that heat up slow during summer suggested that some habitat selection had occurred.

At least three different subpopulation components (southern and northern North Sea, and west of Scotland) were indicated on the basis of differing trends. Analysis of spatial distribution suggested that the boundary between the northern and southern North Sea subpopulations was associated with the change in bathymetry that extended from the coast of Norfolk in England to the southern tip of Norway.

As the offshore hydrocarbon industry matures, operators and national governments must decide whether decommissioned pipelines should be left in situ or removed for onshore disposal. In most jurisdictions, there is a requirement to evaluate the environmental consequences of different pipeline decommissioning options in a comparative assessment. To do this effectively requires an understanding of the associations between pipelines and fauna. Pipeline operators routinely collect video footage for inspection and maintenance purposes using remotely operated vehicles (ROV). This footage has the potential to provide insight into interactions between the marine environment and offshore pipelines. This study uses inspection footage from eight pipelines to quantify the presence and abundance of species and features listed under a number of EU and United Kingdom conservation designations; 12 such features and species were observed on the pipelines or neighboring sediments. The soft coral Alcyonium digitatum was present in the highest densities on pipelines located on mud, while Sabellaria sp. and Echinus esculentus were more common on pipelines in sand. Gadoids, anemones and hermit crabs were also frequently observed around pipelines. The study identifies the limitations to the use of industry ROV footage for ecological purposes, but shows that with consideration of taxon size, image resolution, ROV speed and altitude, this can be a valuable approach to gain additional insights into environment-infrastructure interactions.

Conservation is crucial to maintain fish populations and their exploitation. Since 2013, the spawning stock biomass of the northern stock of European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) has been in a worrying state. A series of low recruitments with a persistently high level of fishing has been blamed, raising concerns about the processes involved in seabass reproduction and settlement in nurseries. Here, we characterise seabass spawning areas along the French Atlantic coast using vessel monitoring system (VMS) data. A non-linear geostatistical approach was applied, from 2008 to 2014, to detect locations where seabass aggregate for spawning. Occurrence maps of spawning distribution were combined into probability maps to quantify the seasonal and inter-annual variability and to highlight recurrent, occasional and unfavourable spawning areas. We identified three main spawning areas: the Rochebonne Plateau in the Bay of Biscay, the Western English Channel and the North of the Cotentin peninsula in the Eastern English Channel. The correlative link between this geographical distribution and environmental factors was investigated using a Bayesian spatio-temporal model. The spatio-temporal structure accounted for the vast majority of the model predictive skills, whereas environmental covariates had a negligible effect.

In this study, generalized additive models were used to predict the spawning habitat of North Sea cod, based on the abundance of spawning fish within three population subareas and nine environmental layers. The length of spawning cod differed among population subareas, consistent with published evidence of maturation differences. In the northeast North Sea (Viking), the peak in the spawning season was estimated to occur after the survey which made the prediction of spawning grounds for this area less certain. Cod were found to prefer areas with temperatures around 5-7 degrees C for spawning and there was a general preference for high salinity waters. Persistence of cod spawning grounds over the study period was related to interannual stability in temperature, with high variability in the use of Southern Bight spawning grounds. As such, cod appear to minimize interannual variability in the initial environmental conditions affecting offspring survival by selecting suitable cold spawning grounds. Seabed conditions also affected spawning distribution with cod selecting coarse sand and avoiding areas of very high tidal flow. The model prediction was compared with the distribution of cod aggregations during the spawning season reported by fishing boats. Seventy per cent of the aggregations was located in areas classified as occasional or recurrent spawning grounds. The predicted distribution confirmed the widespread occurrence of spawning in the North Sea and showed good agreement with recent and past studies of cod egg distribution, suggesting that nearly all major historical areas of spawning still appear in use today.

Atlantic cod Gadus morhua L. was over exploited in the sea areas around the British Isles in the last century and is struggling to recover. There is an urgent need to define the biological stock structure to improve management. In this study, we used data recovered from temperature and depth loggers attached to 252 Atlantic cod to infer and map their movements around the British Isles. Individual cod showed a range of behaviours including migration, site fidelity and limited home ranging. We estimated home ranges and seasonal movements and test predictions based on data from population genetics. Cod from a northern offshore area in the North Sea did not mix with cod from the central and southern North Sea, which in turn did not mix with those from western areas (the Celtic and Irish Seas). Cod experienced average monthly temperatures between 6 and 17 degrees C and occupied average depths between 15 and 165m. Cod that occupied the deeper northern offshore area lived in colder and less variable waters than elsewhere. Differences in thermal experience are likely to underpin variation in physiology and growth rate that will have implications for how the species responds to climate change. This study provides evidence that cod living around the British Isles are comprised of at least one more distinct population unit that is currently recognized for stock management purposes.

During the last century, the main research focus has been on the spatio-temporal match of larval fish and appropriate food (bottom-up processes). However, these field studies are often criticised for their limited capability to disentangle their results from mortality caused by predation since these top-down mechanisms are rarely studied. We examined the predation on herring (Clupea harengus) larvae in a Baltic inshore lagoon by investigating the spatio-temporal overlap of larval herring and their potential predators such as the dominant threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in distinct habitats (sublittoral and littoral areas) using a set of different gears and sampling techniques. Despite significant spatial and temporal predator-prey overlap, stomach analyses suggested that very few larvae were consumed by sticklebacks, even if projected to the entire study area and season. Other well-known predators of clupeid larvae such as gelatinous plankton occur later in the year after young herring have migrated out of the system. The observed predation on herring larvae was much less than expected and appears being a minor factor in determining herring reproduction success in our study area, particularly if compared to other causes of mortality such as egg predation.

We tested for various hypotheses of spatial structure, based on both scientific and expert knowledge, including three isolated subunits, their combination, and no spatial structure. We combined two sets of analyses: (1) a selection of the von Bertalanffy growth model with spatial effects capturing the most accurate spatial structure of the stock and the analysis of long-term spatial patterns (gradients, trends, synchrony) in growth parameters; and (2) an analysis of the synchrony among density-at-age time series between spatial subunits. Growth analysis revealed a spatial structure in three subunits (Le. the southwestern, northeastern and English parts of the EEC) and an overall decline of length-at-age, suggesting Fishery-Induced Evolution. The synchrony analysis revealed high spatiotemporal integrity at the level of the southwestern subunit of the EEC. Our two analyses thus detected a lasting signal of spatial stock structure with a probable isolation of the southwestern subunit from the rest of the EEC. Future research should build on our study by investigating the connectivity of sole throughout its entire life cycle, to improve stock assessment and fishery management.",English,Article,,Web of Science,K,CS - North Sea,">100,000",multidecadal,"50,000-100,000",year,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey,"Fitting a von Bertalanffy Growth Function per area from a long time series of catch data from the Beam trawl survey, and then cross-correlation",1,2,1,Inconsistencies between population structure and stock units may bias stock assessment results and the quantification of risks for sustainable fisheries management.

Trends identified mainly as a function of longitude from west to east were: (i) higher delta N-15, parallel to delta N-15 shifts in the top 200 m of the water column for particulate organic N (Pantoja et al., 2002). The delta 15N trend indicates that the deep trophic web, i.e. A. foliacea at 400-600 m, reflects the delta N-15 signal of the photic zone; (ii) a similar significant trend of delta C-13, related with exploitation of pelagic versus benthic resources by A. foliacea in each area (i.e. by local variability of terrigenous inputs via submarine canyons). More depleted delta C-13 was found at mid-longitudes (Tyrrhenian Sea and Sicily Channel) linked to higher consumption of macroplankton prey (Pasiphaea spp., euphausiids and mesopelagic fishes). The feeding intensity (gut fullness, F) and prey diversity U) of A. foliacea were related, according to generalized linear models, with the temperature and salinity of intermediate waters, variables in turn associated with latitude and longitude. Both F and J were higher in areas with greater shrimp density. The optimal ecological habitat of A. foliacea appears to be located in the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Sicily Channel, where we found the highest F, the greatest trophic diversity and A. foliacea in the best biological condition (i.e. with higher hepato-somatic index, HSI).

Human exploitation of these resources also varies as a function of space, time and the type of fishing activities performed. These three factors determine fishing strategy at different levels of integration. The purpose of this study was to describe and analyse, with respect to different time scales, the relations between the modalities of resource exploitation and the biological or demographic characteristics of the species involved. These investigations relate to the more general task of acquiring the basic knowledge needed for spatialised management of fishing effort. A fleet of trawlers from La Rochelle, operating in the Bay of Biscay, was studied over a 15-year period (1979-1993), which led to the development of a reference resource exploitation scheme for these vessels. The degree of stability of this scheme over time was determined from landing profiles of the 18 most important species fished (94% of landings). An annual cycle for the species composition of landings was determined by multiple factor analysis. Two factors account for more than 55% of the inertia of the data. The first, of biological origin, is closely related to the breeding activity of species and associated migrations between the coast and the open sea. The second is spatial in nature, corresponding to the distribution and availability of resources according to a bathymetric gradient. This organisational scheme persisted over the first 13 years, but showed signs of change toward the end of the study period. Analysis of multi-year trends indicated four periods marked by sustained levels of landings per unit of effort for some species (decreasing for sole and wedge sole, or increasing for Norway lobster, striped red mullet, rays and the smallspotted catshark). These changes are attributable to restrictions on resource access imposed on the fleet (regulations and/or competition among the fishing gears for occupation of space), variations in the abundance of traditionally fished populations (hake, anglerfish) and changes in the professional behaviour of fishermen.

Our major experience by the coupling model subsystems is that well-defined and generic model interfaces are very important for a successful and extendable coupled model framework. The integrated approach, simulating ecosystem dynamics from physics to fish, allows for analysis of the pathways in the ecosystem to investigate the propagation of changes in the ocean climate and to quantify the impacts on the higher trophic level, in this case the sandeel population, demonstrated here on the basis of hindcast data.

4–7 °C and depths around 100 m, while NE-R cod are found at
1–4  °C in shallower waters. During the feeding period the two groups lives in similar ranges of temperature and depth. The low connectivity between the MPAs in the two feeding and nursery areas supports the management choises."

The application was developed for a nursery-dependent fish species, the common sole (Solea solea), on the Eastern Channel population (Western Europe). The approach combined processes of different natures and various sources of observations within an integrated framework for life-cycle modeling: (1) outputs of an individual-based model for larval drift and survival that provided yearly estimates of the dispersion and mortality of eggs and larvae, from spawning grounds to settlement in several coastal nurseries; (2) a habitat suitability model, based on juvenile trawl surveys coupled with a geographic information system, to estimate juvenile densities and surface areas of suitable juvenile habitat in each nursery sector; (3) a statistical catch-at-age model for the estimation of the numbers-at-age and the fishing mortality on subadults and adults. The approach provided estimates of hidden variables and parameters of key biological significance. A simulation approach provided insight to the robustness of the approach when only weak data are available. Estimates of spawning biomass, fishing mortality, and recruitment were close to the estimations derived from stock-assessment working groups. In addition, the model quantified mortality along the life cycle, and estimated site-specific density-dependent mortalities between settled larvae and age-0 juveniles in each nursery ground. This provided a better understanding of the productivity and the specific contribution of each nursery ground toward recruitment and population renewal. Perspectives include further development of the modeling framework on the common sole and applications to other fish species to disentangle the effects of multiple interacting stress factors (e.g., estuarine and coastal nursery habitat degradation, fishing pressure) on population renewal and to develop risk analysis in the context of marine spatial planning for sustainable management of fish resources.",English,Article,Green Submitted,Web of Science,K,CS - North Sea,">100,000",multidecadal,"50,000-100,000",half year,Simulated dynamics,Bayesian Hierarchical Model,2,2,2,,integrated life cycle model,"Task 5.4.

Here we examine an 11-year data set of monthly catches per unit of effort (CPUE) of the red-shrimp Aristeus antennatus. These data comprise 16 locations of two population subunits in the Western Mediterranean, the Catalan coast and the Balearic archipelago. The analysis of their seasonal covariation and its space-time structure showed small-scale geographical segregation of locations linked with the seasonal fluctuations of CPUE. Results further revealed that seasonal synchrony dominates at short spatial scales (ca. 50 km), while asynchrony prevails are broader spatial scales (ca. 200-300 km). This spatial pattern, however, varied over the period examined, although it was specific for each population subunit suggesting contrasting drivers of seasonal synchrony. The Balearic Islands, a patchier population subunit, displayed a seasonal synchrony pattern mainly dependent on biological and oceanographic processes at local scales. By contrast, in the Catalan coast, the pattern appeared related with regional-scale climate, which triggers spatial differences in the phenology of primary producers and the timing of food advection to the seabed.

The results show that fishing plays an important role in shaping the spatial distribution of the two species.

The aim of the presently reported study was to identify the differences in the food composition of cod depending on the area, depth, season, and the cod size and compare it with the findings from the 1970s and 1980s. Materials and methods. Food composition and selection of prey size for Baltic cod was evaluated by examining the stomach contents of 556 adult cod, collected in 2006 and 2007. Fish stomachs were sampled from research catches within the Polish Exclusive Economic Zone. Results. The main component of the cod diet were the clupeids, constituting more than 67% of the total weight of the food recovered from the specimens studied. Other fishes in the diet represented Gobiidae, Ammodytidae, as well as young cod. The dominant invertebrate in the diet was the isopod Saduria entomon which accounted for 13% of the diet by weight. The weight proportion of larger fish, such as herring, Clupea harengus (L.), and cod, increased with the cod size, while the proportion of small- and medium-sized fish (sprats, gobies) decreased. The food composition of cod varied seasonally. The weight proportion of European sprat, Sprattus sprattus (L.), was much higher in winter (55%) than in fall (27%), while the proportion of cod in the diet was higher in the fall (10%) than in winter (4%).

Other fishes in the diet represented Gobiidae, Ammodytidae, as well as young cod. The dominant invertebrate in the diet was the isopod Saduria entomon which accounted for 13% of the diet by weight. The weight proportion of larger fish, such as herring, Clupea harengus (L.), and cod, increased with the cod size, while the proportion of small- and medium-sized fish (sprats, gobies) decreased. The food composition of cod varied seasonally. The weight proportion of European sprat, Sprattus sprattus (L.), was much higher in winter (55%) than in fall (27%), while the proportion of cod in the diet was higher in the fall (10%) than in winter (4%). The proportion of sprat in the diet increased with depth, while that of Ammodytidae and Gobiidae showed a decreasing trend. At depths greater than 40 m, the proportion of invertebrates in cod stomachs decreased. This study demonstrated a significant area effect for sprat; year effect for sprat and Saduria entomon; a seasonal effect for young cod and S. entomon; and a depth effect for sprat, young cod, and S. entomon. The occurrences of herring and small cod increased in the stomach as the predator increased, while no significant relation was found for sprat and S. entomon. The data collected do not indicate that cod select a specific size of sprat or herring, though cod were found to use size selection for S. entomon and juvenile cod. Conclusion. The food composition of cod has undergone certain changes compared to results of Zalachowski (1977, 1985), which covered the 1970s and 1980s. Currently, the proportion of clupeids in the food is approximately 67% (in weight), while during the 1977-1982 it was in the range of 25%-50% depending on cod length.

At the end of 1980s, ecological regime shifts occurred in the Baltic. Since, the Baltic fish assemblage has been dominated by sprats, whereas before cod was the dominant fish species. The majority of previous food studies refer to the period before the shift. This raises the question, how changes in the Baltic ecosystem have affected the diet of cod. The aim of the presently reported study was to identify the differences in the food composition of cod depending on the area, depth, season, and the cod size and compare it with the findings from the 1970s and 1980s. Materials and methods. Food composition and selection of prey size for Baltic cod was evaluated by examining the stomach contents of 556 adult cod, collected in 2006 and 2007.

A life cycle approach was used to quantify the relative influence of these stressors on the Eastern English Channel (EEC) population of the common sole (Solea solea), a coastal-nursery dependent flatfish population which sustains important fisheries. The common sole has a complex life cycle: after eggs hatch, larvae spend several weeks drifting in open water. Survivors go on to metamorphose into benthic fish. Juveniles spend the first two years of their life in coastal and estuarine nurseries. Close to maturation, they migrate to deeper areas, where different subpopulations supplied by different nurseries reproduce and are exploited by fisheries. A spatially structured age-and stage-based hierarchical Bayesian model integrating various aspects of ecological knowledge, data sources and expert knowledge was built to quantitatively describe this complex life cycle. The model included the low connectivity among three subpopulations in the EEC, the influence of hydrographic variability, the availability of suitable juvenile habitat and fisheries. Scenarios were designed to quantify the effects of interacting stressors on population renewal. Results emphasized the importance of coastal nursery habitat availability and quality for the population renewal. Realistic restoration scenarios of the highly degraded Seine estuary produced a two-third increase in catch potential for the adjacent subpopulation. Fisheries, however, remained the main source of population depletion. Setting fishing mortality to the maximum sustainable yield led to substantial increases in biomass (+100%) and catch (+33%) at the EEC scale. The approach also showed how climate-driven variability in hydrography is likely to interact with human pressures, e.g., overfishing increased the sensitivity to unfavourable conditions. Our results provided insights into the dynamics of numerous exploited coastal-nursery-dependent species while paving the way toward more robust advice for sustainable management of these resources.

However, protection for this species is limited in European waters and varies spatially. Without information on the amount of time individuals spend in different areas, any potential risks to population levels from incidental capture, possible future exploitation and climate change will be difficult to assess. To quantify the annual space-use patterns within political-economic zones in the north-east Atlantic we used geolocation data from seven transmitter-tagged basking sharks tracked for 964 days (16,754 km). Basking sharks tagged within the UK protection zone off south-west England and north-west Scotland spent subsequently only about 22% (range, 2.4-47.7%) of time at liberty within this zone, and a further 30% in the UK fishing zone. Although only about 6% of time was spent in the territorial waters of Ireland and France, basking sharks remained in UK, Irish and French fishing and EEZ zones for over 71% of track time (range, 51.4-89.2%). Sharks did not occupy International waters away from the European shelf at any time. These results indicate basking sharks move between different economic zones and were not afforded statutory protection for the major part of the time (78%) they spent within preferred habitat on the European shelf. This demonstrates the limited capacity of the British protection zone for encompassing the greater part of shark space utilisation. Tracked basking sharks regularly crossed national zone boundaries suggesting that conservation measures for this species need to be framed on a European, rather than national, basis. This study highlights the need for better information about the movements and habitat use by marine animals if Conservation strategies are to be truly effective. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

A total of 24 families and 52 fish species were recorded and depth was consistently associated with a significant proportion of the variation of the fish assemblage. The highest species richness was observed at the shallowest depth layer (0-50 m) and significantly decreased, remaining almost constant, in deeper layers. Similarly the highest abundance was recorded at 0-50 m, where C. julis represented the most abundant species, and decreased progressively throughout the whole depth gradient. Although the factor habitat complexity explained only a small proportion of the fish assemblage variation, significant differences among different degrees of habitat complexity were observed, together with a general positive trend for species richness and abundance with increasing habitat complexity. The ROV also allowed us to observe some rare or poorly known fish species such as Scorpaenodes arenai, Hyporthodus haifensis, Myliobatis aquila, Gadella maraldi, Epinephelus caninus and Lappanella fasciata.

The aim of the present study was to explore whether and to what extent parr from different S. trutta spawning streams and hatcheries can be differentiated, using water chemistry and otolith microchemistry. Water chemistry samples demonstrated significant spatial variation between different study regions (Estonia and Finland); Sr, Mg, Fe, Zn, Ca and Cu contributed most to the separation.

The reclassification rate of S. trutta parr was on average 73%, being highest in Finnish streams and hatcheries, followed by Latvia and Estonia. Otolith Sr-87:Sr-86 and Sr:Ca ratios were the most important in discriminating fish from different sampling sites.

A life cycle approach was used to quantify the relative influence of these stressors on the Eastern English Channel (EEC) population of the common sole (Solea solea), a coastal-nursery dependent flatfish population which sustains important fisheries. The common sole has a complex life cycle: after eggs hatch, larvae spend several weeks drifting in open water. Survivors go on to metamorphose into benthic fish. Juveniles spend the first two years of their life in coastal and estuarine nurseries. Close to maturation, they migrate to deeper areas, where different subpopulations supplied by different nurseries reproduce and are exploited by fisheries. A spatially structured age-and stage-based hierarchical Bayesian model integrating various aspects of ecological knowledge, data sources and expert knowledge was built to quantitatively describe this complex life cycle. The model included the low connectivity among three subpopulations in the EEC, the influence of hydrographic variability, the availability of suitable juvenile habitat and fisheries. Scenarios were designed to quantify the effects of interacting stressors on population renewal. Results emphasized the importance of coastal nursery habitat availability and quality for the population renewal. Realistic restoration scenarios of the highly degraded Seine estuary produced a two-third increase in catch potential for the adjacent subpopulation. Fisheries, however, remained the main source of population depletion. Setting fishing mortality to the maximum sustainable yield led to substantial increases in biomass (+100%) and catch (+33%) at the EEC scale. The approach also showed how climate-driven variability in hydrography is likely to interact with human pressures, e.g., overfishing increased the sensitivity to unfavourable conditions. Our results provided insights into the dynamics of numerous exploited coastal-nursery-dependent species while paving the way toward more robust advice for sustainable management of these resources.

The Levantine Intermediate Water (LIW), inhabited by A. foliacea in the western Basin, had significant temperature (T) and salinity (S) increases in the 1950-1970 period, and Nile damming has contributed about 45% of the total S increase of Western Mediterranean deep-water masses from the 1960s to the late 1990s (Skliris and Lascaratos, 2004). This had to increase, for instance, LIW salinity at its formation site in the eastern Mediterranean. Nile damming was probably a triggering factor for the extinction/drop in abundance of deep-sea shrimp off Catalonian coasts. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Multi-seasonal sampling was conducted at one of the oil platforms located in the central North Sea between September 2010 and January 2014 to characterise temporal variation in the stomach contents of different fish species. A total of 6 fish species were recorded, including commercially important gadoids such as saithe Pollachius virens, haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus and cod Gadus morhua. Saithe fed predominantly on euphausiids and haddock consumed a large proportion of ophiuroids, whereas cod were mainly piscivorous. The prey compositions were significantly different between species, indicating the presence of interspecific prey resource partitioning among those species. To further investigate possible links between the feeding habits of the most dominant fish species, saithe, and the physical presence of offshore platforms across the North Sea, a separate set of stomach data was collected during the 2012 Quarter 3 International Bottom Trawl Survey aboard the FRV `Scotia'. The multivariate analysis of both data sets showed that the observed spatio-temporal variability in the saithe diet was significantly explained by proximity to the nearest offshore platforms and changes in water temperatures, which appear to reflect patterns of euphausiid availability over space and time. The physical presence of the offshore structures may potentially affect the distribution/availability of zooplankton (i.e. euphausiids) and thereby influence the feeding behaviour of saithe and any other marine populations that are interconnected to the dynamics of such trophic interactions.",English,Article,Green Submitted,Web of Science,K,CS - North Sea,">100,000",quarter,">100,000",quarter,Stomach Contents Analyses,Multivariate analysis,1,2,3,Offshore oil and gas installations provide a unique feeding ground for a variety of commercially important fish species in the North Sea.,Effect of human structures on feeding ecology,"Task 5.4.

Rapid expansion and deleterious ecosystem effects have motivated extensive research on this species; here this research is synthesized. Maps of the global distribution are provided and the invasion history of N. melanostomus, which spread more rapidly at first in North America, but has undergone substantial expansion over the past decade in the Baltic Sea, is summarized. Meta-analyses comparing their size at age, diet, competitors and predators in North American and European ecosystems are provided. Size at age is region specific, with saline habitats typically supporting larger and faster growing individuals than fresh water. Neogobius melanostomus prey differs substantially between regions, demonstrating a capacity to adapt to locally abundant food sources. Neogobius melanostomus comprise at least 50% of the diet of eight taxa in at least one site or life stage; in total, 16 predator taxa are documented from the Laurentian Great Lakes v. five from Eurasia. Invasive N. melanostomus are the only common forage fish to heavily exploit mussels in the Laurentian Great Lakes and the Baltic Sea, facilitating the transfer of energy from mussels to higher trophic levels in both systems. Neogobius melanostomus morphology, life history, reproduction, habitat preferences, environmental tolerances, parasites, environmental effects, sampling strategies and management are also discussed. Neogobius melanostomus inhabit a wide range of temperate freshwater and brackish-water ecosystems and will probably continue to spread via ballast water, accidental bait release and natural dispersal worldwide. Climate change will probably enhance N. melanostomus expansion by elevating water temperatures closer to its energetic optimum of 26 degrees C. Future research needs are presented; most pressing are evaluating the economic effects of N. melanostomus invasion, determining long-term population level effects of egg predation on game-fish recruitment and comparing several variables (density, ecological effects morphology and life history) among invaded ecosystems.

Restoration efforts are often constrained by limited resources, and insights from SLOSS studies therefore have important implications if restoration efforts can be optimized by manipulating the spatial configuration of restored habitats. Yet, the relevance of SLOSS for habitat restoration remains largely unexplored. Here, we report the effects of spatial reef configuration on early colonization of marine organisms after restoring boulder reef habitats. Reefs were restored in single large (SL) and several small (SS) designs in the western Baltic Sea, where century-long boulder extraction has severely degraded large reef areas and likely exacerbated regional declines in commercially important gadoids (Gadidae spp.). We sampled the field sites using remote underwater video systems in a before-after control-impact (BACI) design and obtained probabilistic inferences on restoration and SLOSS effects from Bayesian hierarchical models. Probabilities of a positive restoration effect were high (>95%) for gadoids, labrids and demersal gobies, moderate (60%-75%) for species richness and sand gobies, and low (<5%) for flatfish abundance. Notably, gadoid abundance increased 60-fold and 129-fold on average at SL and SS respectively. The species composition at restored reefs deviated from control sites, mainly driven by large-bodied piscivores. Spatial reef configuration had the strongest effect on small-bodied mesopredators, including gobies, which were more abundant at SS and driving distinct species assemblages between the reef designs.

Restoration efforts are often constrained by limited resources, and insights from SLOSS studies therefore have important implications if restoration efforts can be optimized by manipulating the spatial configuration of restored habitats. Yet, the relevance of SLOSS for habitat restoration remains largely unexplored. Here, we report the effects of spatial reef configuration on early colonization of marine organisms after restoring boulder reef habitats. Reefs were restored in single large (SL) and several small (SS) designs in the western Baltic Sea, where century-long boulder extraction has severely degraded large reef areas and likely exacerbated regional declines in commercially important gadoids (Gadidae spp.). We sampled the field sites using remote underwater video systems in a before-after control-impact (BACI) design and obtained probabilistic inferences on restoration and SLOSS effects from Bayesian hierarchical models. Probabilities of a positive restoration effect were high (>95%) for gadoids, labrids and demersal gobies, moderate (60%-75%) for species richness and sand gobies, and low (<5%) for flatfish abundance. Notably, gadoid abundance increased 60-fold and 129-fold on average at SL and SS respectively. The species composition at restored reefs deviated from control sites, mainly driven by large-bodied piscivores. Spatial reef configuration had the strongest effect on small-bodied mesopredators, including gobies, which were more abundant at SS and driving distinct species assemblages between the reef designs. In addition to providing suitable conditions for reef species, results suggest that SS can also benefit soft-bottom taxa, possibly through a dispersed predator-mediated effect relative to SL.

Recently the race for space in heavily used areas such as the North Sea triggered the proposal of co-locating other activities such as aquaculture or fisheries with passive gears in offshore wind farms (OWFs). Our interdisciplinary approach combined a quantification of spatial overlap of activities by using Vessel Monitoring System and logbook data with a stakeholder consultation to conclude and verify on the actual feasibility of co-location. In the German Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the North Sea up to 90% of Danish and 40% of German annual gilinet fleet landings of plaice overlapped with areas where OWFs are developed. Our results indicated further that the international gilinet fishery could lose up to 50% in landings within the North Sea German EEZ when OWF areas are closed entirely for fisheries. No spatial overlap was found for UK potters targeting brown crab in the German EEZ. We further identified a number of key issues and obstacles that to date hinder an actual implementation of co-location as a measure in the marine spatial planning process: defining the legal base; implementation of safety regulations; delineation of minimum requirements for fishing vessels such as capacities, quotas, technical equipment; implementation of a licensing process; and scoping for financial subsidies to set up business. The stakeholder consultation verified the scientific findings and highlighted that all those points need to be addressed in a planning process. In the German EEZ we have shown that the socioeconomic importance of spatial overlap varies within planning boundaries. Therefore we recommend an interdisciplinary bottom-up approach when scoping for suitable areas of co-location. Hence, an informed marine spatial planning process requires comprehensive and spatial explicit socio-economic viability studies factoring in also ecological effects of OWFs on target species.

We developed a marine spatial risk assessment framework for the UK continental shelf assessing the vulnerability of 11 fish and shellfish species to aggregate extraction. We calculated a sensitivity index (SI) using life-history characteristics and modelled species distributions on the UK shelf using long-term monitoring data and indicator kriging. Merging sensitivity indices and predicted species distributions allowed us to map the sensitivity of the selected fish to aggregate extraction. The robustness of the sensitivity map was affected primarily by widespread species with a low to medium level of sensitivity, while highly sensitive species with more restricted distributions had a limited effect on the overall sensitivity. The highest sensitivity in the case study occurred in coastal regions, and where nursery and spawning areas of four important commercial species occur. To test the framework, we overlaid the estimated sensitivity map with the occurrence of aggregate extraction activity in inshore waters, including sediment plume estimations, to describe species vulnerability to dredging. We conclude that our spatially explicit risk assessment framework can be applied to other ecosystem components and pressures at different spatial scales and it is therefore a promising tool that can support the sustainable development of marine spatial plans.

The consistency of year-class strengths estimated over time from these surveys was taken as an indication of the reliability of the survey data to monitor megrim population abundance. Recruitment strength was, to a large extent, the main factor governing abundance found in successive years. This is due to the fact that the greater percentage of accessible biomass comprises 1. 2 and 3-year-old individuals. Four spot megrim (L. boscii) is currently the most abundant species in this zone due to the weak recruitment of L.. ir pp in recent years.

The round goby, Neogobius melanostomus (Pallas, 1814), is a recent invader in the Curonian Lagoon, SE Baltic Sea. As invasive species are among the most severe threats for biodiversity loss and can induce food web alterations, the development of round goby population in the Curonian Lagoon and its possible impacts on fish community and the entire ecosystem are of great scientific interest. This research reports on the expansion and trophic role of round goby in the Curonian Lagoon. Materials and methods. Occurrence and abundance of round goby was investigated using a beach seine and gill nets at the northern and central parts of the Curonian Lagoon during a six-year period from 2007 to 2012. The trophic niche of the newcomer was revealed by applying gut content and stable isotope analyses (SIA). A total of 61 samples of other fish species were taken for SIA in order to reveal with which resident fish species the exploitative competition could be expected. Stable isotope mixing models were used to evaluate the contribution of round goby to the nutrition of top predators of the Curonian Lagoon: European perch, Perca fluviatilis Linnaeus, 1758; pike-perch, Sander lucioperca (Linnaeus, 1758); great cormorant, Phalacrocorax carbo; and grey heron, Ardea cinerea. Results. The survey showed that round goby expanded its distribution area and recently occurs in the entire Lithuanian part of the Curonian Lagoon. Variation in the density of round goby suggests that the invader's abundance may be stabilised in the northern part of the lagoon. Gut content and stable isotope analyses showed round goby being mainly benthivorous. The largest trophic overlap with respect to SIA was detected between the invader and ruffe, Gymnocephalus cernua (Linnaeus, 1758), the fish which presumably exploits the same habitat type. According to stable isotope mixing models round goby was included with considerable shares into the diet of top predators. Conclusion. The further expansion of round goby inside the Curonian Lagoon is ongoing. However, there is evidence on population density stabilisation in the northern part of the lagoon. Native benthivorous fish, especially ruffe, may be affected through competition for food resources in habitats where the newcomer is numerous. Round goby significantly contributes to the diet of piscivorous fish and birds.

Although spatial distribution patterns and fish time series of abundance have been studied in the past, little research has addressed the impact of spatial scale on mapping spatiotemporal patterns. To achieve this goal, the first step is to develop a method describing spatiotemporal communities statistically. At three spatial resolutions, from 1043 km(2) to 522 km(2), we compared the output of a new framework, the Autoregressive Spatiotemporal Clustering analysis (ASTEC) and we finally retained the most parsimonious scale: 522 km(2). ASTEC combines a zero-inflated Poisson model with latent predictors alongside a hierarchical clustering analysis using multiscale bootstrap resampling. It estimates the spatial and spatiotemporal communities formed by 16 species in the Eastern English Channel using 20 years of data from the Channel Ground Fishery Survey. Community structure was strongly dependent upon the spatial scale of analysis and the smallest scale provided the most parsimonious model. Moreover, integrating temporality in spatial studies defined a stable composition and richness community structure. Combining a spatial and spatiotemporal approaches highlighted cluster composition shifts over time. It shows that small-scale data should be used for studies on spatial connectivity and meta-community when integrating temporality. Moreover, the scale of the study did not matter anymore in a spatiotemporal case.

A total of 32 herring schools were tracked continuously for up to 1.2 h by multi-beam sonar. Larger herring schools swam faster and in warmer water masses than smaller schools. Herring had on average a low dynamic tendency, with relatively few split, join and behavioural events per hour, probably due to low temperatures near the Arctic front. No clear diurnal vertical migration was detected based on the acoustic data, and herring were distributed from the surface area down to approximately 360 m. Zooplankton biomass was the highest at the Arctic front and lower on both sides of the front, indicating that herring were successfully searching for high food concentrations there. We suggest that herring were also feeding in the deep (> 300 m) cold 'fridge' based on stomach samples and high concentrations of larger zooplankton at these depths. The temperature differences were considerable between the surface and 400 m depth, exceeding 5 degrees C (0.5-5.5) in some areas. Nevertheless, herring did not seem to have any strong vertical preferences with regard to temperature and tolerated very low temperatures.

Genetic differentiation quickly becomes zero as soon as a few dozen migrants are exchanged per generation. This provides little information to determine whether migration can ensure demographic coupling. The resulting difficulties in delineating conservation units for the management of commercially exploited marine fish species are well illustrated in the case of the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrox). Previous attempts to assess connectivity patterns in the northeast Atlantic have been hampered by a lack of spatial genetic structure. In contrast, mark-recapture data suggested low migration rates between regional spawning areas. Here, we show how a spatial gradient of introgressed Mediterranean ancestry across the northeast Atlantic reflects cryptic patterns of genetic and demographic connectivity. Using a 1K SNP chip data set in 827 individuals sampled from Portugal to the North Sea, we found null overall genetic differentiation across the northeast Atlantic. We however detected a subtle latitudinal admixture gradient originating at the edge of the contact zone with the Mediterranean sea bass lineage. Two significant breaks in the ancestry gradient at the tip of Galicia and northern Brittany indicated barriers to effective dispersal between demographically distinct units. Moreover, a northward expansion signal in Irish and North Seas was revealed by the surfing of rare Mediterranean alleles at the edge of the species range.

The most recent report of the ICES advisory committee for sea bass populations (ICES, 2019) states that spawning-stock biomass has been declining since 2009–2010 and is now just above or below the maximum sustainability yield, depending on the region considered. The need for precise stock assessment is therefore more crucial than ever for a proper management of fisheries. To this end, the spatial delineation of at least three main populations would need to be revised to account for these new findings. Namely, the northern management unit comprising populations from the North Sea, Irish Sea, English Channel, Bristol Channel, and Celtic Sea includes areas that most likely belong to the northern part of the Bay of Biscay population. Moreover, the Bay of Biscay south, which is currently grouped with the Atlantic Iberian Waters, most likely belongs to the Bay of Biscay population."

The Baltic Sea comprises a heterogeneous oceanographic environment that structures the spatial and temporal distribution of the dominant species cod, herring, and sprat (Sprattus sprattus). Despite local differences, the stocks are traditionally managed as homogeneous units. Here, we present a metacommunity-perspective on source sink dynamics of Baltic Sea fish stocks by using a spatially disaggregated statistical food web model. The model is fitted to area-specific time series of multiple abiotic and biotic variables using state-space methods. Our analysis reveals pronounced net fluxes between areas, indicative of source sink dynamics, as well as area-specific differences in species interactions (i.e., density dependence, competition, and predator prey) and the degree of fishing and climate impact on survival and recruitment. Furthermore, model simulations show that decreasing exploitation pressure in the source area for cod (without reallocating fishing effort) produces an increase in neighboring sink habitats, but a decline of prey species in response to increased predation.

Now, an advanced version considers the underlying size-based dynamics of the targeted stocks for Danish and German vessels harvesting the North Sea and Baltic Sea fish stocks. The stochastic fishing process is specific to the vessel catching power and to the encountered population abundances, based on disaggregated research survey data. The impact of the effort displacement on the fish stocks and the vessels' economic consequences were evaluated by simulating individual choices of vessel speed, fishing grounds, and ports. Some scenarios led to increased energy efficiency and profit while others such as fishing closures or fishermen optimization sometimes lowered the revenue by altering the spatiotemporal effort allocation. On an individual scale, the simulations led to gains and losses due to either the interactions between vessels or to the alteration of individual patterns.

Individual vessels can fish in five distinct areas, and the utility of fishing in an area depends on expected revenue measured as previous success (value per unit effort) and experience (past fishing effort allocation), as well as perceived costs (measured as distance to landing port weighted by fuel price). The model predicts fisher location choice, and the predictions are evaluated using iterative partial cross validation by fitting the model over a series of separate time-periods (nine separate time-periods). Results show the relative importance of the different drivers that change over time. They indicate that there are three main drivers throughout the study, past annual effort, past monthly effort in the year of fishing, and fuel price, largely reflecting the fact that previous practices where success was gained are learned (i.e. experience) and become habitual, and that seasonal variations also dominate behaviour in terms of the strong monthly trends and variable costs. In order to provide an indication of the model's predictive capabilities, a simulated closure of one of the study areas was undertaken (an area that mapped reasonably well with the North Sea cod 2001 partial closure of the North Sea for 10 weeks of that year). The predicted reallocation of effort was compared against realized/observed reallocation of effort, and there was good correlation at the trip level, with a maximum 10% misallocation of predicted effort for that year.

We link exhibited trends with changes that took place in the wider Baltic Sea region in fisheries' resource abundance and management, in order to provide insights in the sector's adaptation potential to past changes. Results suggest that the SSF was affected by changes in the abundance and allocation of fishing opportunities (TACs) of major target species (herring and cod) and technical measures for fishing gear. There is also evidence to suggest that the SSF was affected by measures directed to the activity of the Large-Scale Fishery (LSF). We argue that such an approach can provide new insights on the impacts of future management changes or incidents of environmental variability on the SSF sector and is crucial in order to effectively integrate SSFs within policy.

Huge fluctuations in abundance have traditionally been associated with external environmental forcing on recruitment, exempting other processes from contributing to fisheries collapse. On the other hand, theory predicts that density dependence and overexploitation can increase the likelihood of population oscillations. Here, we combined nonlinear population modeling with Bayesian analysis to examine the importance of different regulatory mechanisms on the collapse of European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) in the Bay of Biscay. The approach relied on detailed population data and in a careful characterization of changes in the environment experienced by anchovy early stages based mainly on satellite remote sensing. Alternative hypotheses about external forcing on recruitment determined prediction skill and provided alternative interpretations of the causes behind the collapse. Density dependence was weak and unable to generate huge oscillations. Instead, models considering changes in phytoplankton phenology or in larval drift presented the best prediction skill.

The comparison was carried out considering total landings and the six main species targeted inside the three miles area (sand smelt, cuttlefish, red mullet, sole, turbot, and mantis shrimp). Within a general reduction of total landings, a differential effect based on the analysed m tiers was detected, with small trawlers being more negatively affected than the large and rapido ones, which showed, for some species, positive impacts. From an ecological point of view, though, no positive overall effects were detected, probably due to the fact that the adopted measure is not sufficient to reduce the overexploitation. In any case, all this is affecting the structure of the small-scale fishery in the area, since small trawlers are changing m tier, moving towards the artisanal fishery, with deep impacts on the very coastal area that the trawling ban was designated to protect, compromising all possible benefits.

However, this information is not available for the majority of marine species and is difficult to obtain for those with low population densities. The common skate, Dipturus batis, was once abundant and widespread in the North-East Atlantic but is now thought to be locally extinct in the Irish Sea and in the central and southern North Sea, and is listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. The constraints of skate body morphology on locomotory mode assume low levels of activity with long periods spent resting on the seabed, therefore predicting a high degree of site fidelity. To investigate this hypothesis we tagged 8 common skate (two male and six female, mass range: 10.9-63.5 kg) with depth and temperature-logging data storage tags off the west coast of Scotland in May 2008. All 6 tags attached to females were recovered after 1-9 months at liberty. All 6 individuals exhibited pronounced site fidelity to highly localised areas. Within these local areas however, time-depth profiles were dominated by periods of high activity, with vertical movements of >100 m being conducted on a regular, sometimes daily, basis. Intra-individual plasticity was observed in vertical activity patterns with individuals switching between low and high activity patterns. Smaller skate were generally less active and occupied deeper depths. Limited short-term horizontal movements in preferred habitats supporting apparently high foraging activity highlights the need for spatial management of 'refugial' populations of this once widespread fish, that appears now largely extirpated from European waters.

D. batis, using electronic tags and as such provides the first insights
into the subsurface behavior and vertical activity patterns of this, the
largest batoid species in European waters. Thus, overall it appears likely that tracked fish did not move far whilst at liberty, perhaps even remaining in the localized region of Loch Sunart for the entire time. One reason why skate may frequent this area is the
presence of two aquaculture cages containing salmon. High densities of large rays have been documented at fish farms in other locations, presumably, together with other aggregating wild fish, to take advantage of the persistent supply of food available in terms of unused feed, dead cultured fish (Dempster et al., 2005) and abundant benthic infauna (Brown et al., 1987). Our results support the hypothesis that individual skate may associate with specific sites for long periods. The slow life-history characteristics of elasmobranchs, including a late age at maturity, slow growth, low fecundity and long gestation period, result in low rates of population increase (Stevens et al., 2000). Due to recent declines in abundance, coupled with their inherent vulnerability to extinction, common skate are listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Common skate were protected by a zero total allowable catch (TAC) in European waters, and new regulations now prevent them from being retained by commercial vessels necessitating the prompt release of unharmed fish. However, there is currently no spatial protection for this species in the European seas.","Despite a recent surge in tagging studies, our knowledge of the movements and behavior of batoids is poor, particularly in the vertical

As extinction vulnerability is linked to geographic range (Dulvy and Reynolds, 2002), the extreme site fidelity demonstrated by female common skate likely explains historical local extinctions. Taking all of this into consideration, it's seems that there is little capacity for recolonization of depleted areas since juvenile recruitment to new areas would be dependent on adult female dispersal and egg-laying. The authors highlight the need for spatial management of these populations across their entire range."

The recapture of two black anglerfish, one released in the distribution area of the southern stock and recaptured in the northern stock location, and another released at the boundaries between these stocks and found in the northern stock area, is probably linked to movements between populations. This is the first evidence of interactions between black anglerfish stocks. Since stock definitions are essential for fishery management, the present results point out the need for revising the assessment and management of anglerfish in the Bay of Biscay and the Celtic Sea. A failure in discriminating population structures could lead to over-fishing and finally to possible erosion of genetic diversity at the species level (Stephenson, 1999). Stock definitions have tended not to be revisited in fisheries management. Stock structure can often create more uncertainty in fisheries management, particularly when it contradicts historically established stock and management boundaries, however, ignoring such information can contribute to an erroneous and ineffective fisheries management (Begg and Waldman, 1999).","Although the size of the anglerfish had no apparent influence on the displacement distance, as was also observed by Laurenson et al. (2005), the five longest displacements of white anglerfish were undertaken by juveniles.",Task 5.2 Predicting species distribution ,Lophius,juv and adults,demersal,Research & Commercial combined,Nets,Combined gillnet-trammel nets,Management,area covered,Management,No,,,,"spatiotemporal: dynamic, movement, allocation, shift, migration, displacement (e.g. by depth)",visualization/maps,visualization/maps,Yes,"Within the frame of an international tagging program, movements
of black and white anglerfish (Lophius budegassa and L. piscatorius) in Southern European waters were studied. The movements of the anglerfish indicate mixing between northern and southern populations which may have strong implications for the current geographical boundaries of the stocks from a management perspective. In the present study, there is further evidence of these movements in both directions, as the first report of movement of white anglerfish between the Le Danois Bank and the Cantabrian continental shelf."

The absence of species-specific information on catch, life history and migration of skates has often precluded the development of single-species stock assessments and led to the use of cursory multispecies assessments, which lack the ability to track species-specific catch and abundance trends. This has resulted in undetected local extirpations, as has been previously reported for common (Dipturus batis, Rajidae), white (Rostroraja alba, Rajidae) and long-nose (Dipturus oxyrhinchus, Rajidae) skates in the Irish Sea. Here, we (a) use case studies to illustrate how the perception of skate population structure and stock status has historically been masked through multispecies assessment and management practices, (b) review current information on the movement of skates and identify gaps in knowledge, and (c) identify biases associated with the use of various tagging technologies, which have confounded our understanding of movement and migration ecology of skates. Considering that over 40% of extant Rajidae species are listed as Data Deficient by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, we illustrate a critical need to broaden the current understanding of skate life history, movement and migration ecology by providing recommendations on the further application of electronic tags and biogeochemical natural tags in movement studies and highlight the benefits that studies using these approaches have for novel management frameworks.",English,Article,,Web of Science,K,Global,">100,000",multidecadal,,,"Data Storage, GPS, Acoustic Taggin",,,,,"As stated, the first step in developing appropriate assessment and management approaches for Rajidae species involves the collec-tion of species-specific landings, abundance, movement and stock structure data. Simply stated, the paucity of information on the ecol-ogy of skates leaves a critical gap in the understanding of ecosystem dynamics and multispecies interactions and places species at risk of long-term and often unnoticed declines. However, if alternative as-sessment and management strategies which incorporate newly gen-erated movement and migration information are adopted, caution should be exercised. The use of temporal closures, spatial closures and gear type restrictions to conserve bycaught species can have a direct, negative effect on target fisheries (Hunter et al., 2006). Therefore, because of the direct effect their decisions have on eco-logical and socioeconomic elements of fisheries, it is imperative that fishery managers are well-informed and efficient in management strategy decision- making.","Multispecies assessment strategies inherently contain an unknown level of uncertainty on the status of individual species incorporated in the multispecies complex.

We combined a Bayesian Belief Network with a Geographical Information System (GIS) for the spatially explicit quantification of the ecological and economic risks of spatial management options. As an example we assessed the German exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the North Sea to determine the potential effects of 2 scenarios on the vulnerability of plaice Pleuronectes platessa to fishing, fishing fleets and their revenues. In the first scenario we simulated a shift in plaice distribution due to changes in bottom temperatures to assess spatial management options. Then we imitated an expansion of offshore wind energy development with an associated reallocation of international fishing effort to assess the ecological and economic consequences. We predicted that an increase of 0.5 degrees C in the average bottom temperature would require a significant reduction in fishing effort to maintain the current relative level of the vulnerability of plaice to fishing. The likely consequences of the second scenario were a homogenous increase in plaice catches around the areas closed for fishing, together with a decrease in the vulnerability of plaice to fishing within 17% of the study area. Our results showed the great potential of this framework to integrate the spatially explicit assessment of the economic and ecological risks of spatial management options.

Recent changes in stock structures, conditions and stock mixing between eastern and western Baltic cod can jeopardize the reliability of stock assessments and of the fishery economy. We modelled how different management, individual vessel decision-making, and stock growth and mixing scenarios have induced alternative individual vessel spatial effort allocation and economic performance by affecting fishing costs and by changing the relative stock abundance and size distribution. Stock mixing heavily influences profit and stock abundance for stocks that have experienced increased fishing mortality (F) levels. Western cod F has increased from a higher total allowed catches (TAC) advised in the medium-term due to the westward migration of eastern cod while eastern cod F has increased from reduced growth in the east. Greater pressures on western cod and decreased eastern cod growth and conditions greatly reduce the overall cod spawning stock biomass, thus changing the landing size composition and associated fishery profits. As a cumulative effect, fishing efforts are redirected towards western areas depending on management (quotas). However, total profits are less affected when traditional fishing opportunities and switching possibilities for other species and areas are maintained. Our evaluation indicates that current management mechanisms cannot correct for potential detrimental effects on cod fisheries when effort re-allocation changes landing origins. By investigating different economic starting conditions we further show that Baltic cod mis-management could have resulted in unintended unequal (skewed) impacts and serious consequences for certain fleets and fishing communities compared with others. Our management strategy evaluation is instrumental in capturing non-linear effects of different recommendations on sustainability and economic viability, and we show that fixed F-values management is likely not an attainable or sufficient goal in ensuring the sustainability and viability of fisheries and stocks given changing biological conditions.",English,Article,,,K,CS - Baltic Sea,">100,000",five year,"1,000-5,000",subday,Simulated dynamics,DISPLACE model,2,2,3,,,Task 5.3 Predicting changes in fisheries distribution ,Gadus morhua,juv and adults,demersal,Commercial,Demersal trawls,Bottom trawl,Management,other (MSY),Legislation/ Management/Regulation,Yes,Biomass (SSB) _ Revenues _ Landings _ Gross Value Added _ Value Per Unit Fuel,Multiple,,"spatiotemporal: dynamic, movement, allocation, shift, migration, displacement (e.g. by depth)",bio-economic,DISPLACE model,Yes,"When the current management is abandoned and the FMSY approach is applied exclusively for both cod stocks, outcomes change toward more sustainable exploitation as indicated by F and SSB levels, while revenues from catches increase for both stocks  based on higher advised TACs.

Those anthropogenic activities that affect spawning conditions and could underlie MSP regulations are then analysed on the basis of the pressure maps to assess their importance for recruitment success in comparison to other pressures which are not subject to MSP by-laws, e.g. eutrophication. The results confirm that MSP could potentially improve the management of certain fish stocks and help to close existing gaps in European fisheries policy. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Moreover, little insight exists on the impacts of past environmental and management changes on the German Baltic SSF. Using a spatial database developed specifically for the German Baltic SSF sector, we assess the sector's key structural and operational characteristics (vessel numbers, gears, landings and target species) to review its development during the period between 2000-09. We link exhibited trends with changes that took place in the wider Baltic Sea region in fisheries' resource abundance and management, in order to provide insights in the sector's adaptation potential to past changes. Results suggest that the SSF was affected by changes in the abundance and allocation of fishing opportunities (TACs) of major target species (herring and cod) and technical measures for fishing gear. There is also evidence to suggest that the SSF was affected by measures directed to the activity of the Large-Scale Fishery (LSF). We argue that such an approach can provide new insights on the impacts of future management changes or incidents of environmental variability on the SSF sector and is crucial in order to effectively integrate SSFs within policy.

We showed that the box has certainly had an effect on reducing bycatch in the fishery, but that this effect is indirect by more frequently protecting sensitive habitat types such as shallow sandy grounds inside the box.An important adjustment to the box would, therefore, consider more specific closures according to benthic habitat types rather than the current widespread Norway pout box fishing closure as a protective management strategy."

Following a theoretical model, we investigate whether the composition of marine fish communities can be understood in terms of a set of life-history strategies and whether the prevalence of the strategies follows specific spatial patterns that can be related to the environment. Location: European seas. Time period: 1980-2014. Major taxa studied: Fish. Methods: An extensive set of scientific bottom trawl surveys was collected to obtain the species composition of fish communities across European seas. We complemented these data with species-specific information regarding six life-history traits, reflecting reproductive, growth and feeding modes. We then calculated the optimal number of strategies needed to summarize the information contained in the traits by using archetypal analysis. The proportion of each obtained strategy in the communities and their spatial patterns were explained as a function of the environment and their temporal changes were investigated. Results: The species could be decomposed into a continuum of three life-history strategies-opportunistic, periodic and equilibrium-resulting from trade-offs between traits. The marked spatial patterns of these strategies could be explained by depth, temperature and its seasonality, chlorophyll and fishing effort. In recent years, opportunistic and equilibrium strategies significantly increased, probably due to an increase in temperature and decrease in fishing effort. Main conclusions: Our empirical analysis supports a theoretical framework outlining three life-history strategies of fish. The strategies vary predictably in space and time in response to the environment. This highlights the underlying process whereby fitness is optimized through trade-offs between growth, feeding and reproduction under different environmental conditions. Due to their response to the environment, life-history strategies provide a suitable tool for monitoring and understanding community changes in response to natural and anthropogenic stressors, including fishing and climate change.",English,Article,Green Submitted,Web of Science,K,Global,">100,000",month,"10,000-50,000",week,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey,unsupervised learning method Archetypal analysis (AA) _ GAM,2,2,3,"Environmental predictors of life history strategies: the best models with maximum three abiotic predictors explained 50.8%, 77% and 77.6% of the variability

The work presented here, the spatial temporal data framework, is part of a larger study, the NF-UBC Nereus Program, to develop a new approach to model interoperability for closing the gap between marine ecosystem modeling tools via geographic information systems (GIS) technology. The approach we present simplifies interdisciplinary model interoperability by separating technical and scientific challenges into a flexible and modular software approach. To illustrate capabilities of the new framework, we use a remote-sensing derived spatial and temporal time series to drive the primary production dynamics in an existing food web model of the North-Central Adriatic using the Ecospace module of the Ecopath with Ecosim approach. In general, the predictive capabilities of the food web model to hind-cast ecosystem dynamics are enhanced when applying the new framework by better reflecting observed species population trends and distributions. Results show that changes at the phytoplankton level due to changes in primary production are realistically reproduced and cascade up the pelagic food web. The dynamics of zooplankton and small and large pelagic fish are impacted. Highly exploited demersal species such as European hake do, however, not show clear signs of cascading. This may be due to the high fishing pressure on this species and the resulting strong historical decline in the area. In general, the development of the new framework offers ecosystem modelers with unprecedented capabilities to include spatial temporal time series into food web analysis with a minimal set of required steps. It is a promising step toward integrating species distribution models and food web dynamics, and future implementations of interdisciplinary model interoperability. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

One individual spent a third of its foraging time in direct, long distance trips (200-350 km) across the English Channel, but most seals spent the majority (68.5%) of their foraging time in the Iroise Sea, making return trips within 30 km of their departure haulout sites.

function of shipping intensity (distance to port, cargo traffic) and
abiotic hydroclimatic environment (wave exposure). Although high
frequency of release does not necessarily lead to successful invasions,
the round goby seems not to have major environmental
constraints in the Baltic Sea. This points to an obvious need for
effective management measures of the Baltic shipping, including
performing relevant risk assessments in intra-Baltic shipping (e.g.,
David et al., 2013)."

The environment (latitudinal effects) will have an impact on the maturation schedule, with northern (colder water) stocks growing more slowly and maturing at a greater age. This is, however, modified by the impacts of fishing, whereby under severe exploitation, maturation tends towards an earlier age. Cod in the Irish Sea are towards the southern end of the species' range and the stock is severely depleted, with most males and females maturing between 2 and 3 years of age and at a relatively small size. The North Sea cod stock is considered to be harvested unsustainably, and, in addition, in recent years has shown the classic shift in maturity schedule to most fish maturing at a younger age and smaller size. The Barents Sea (Northeast Arctic) cod stock has undergone major changes in population size, but is currently not overexploited. There have also been shifts in the maturation schedules of Northeast Arctic cod. However, over the past decade or so, there has not been a clear trend in the age- or length-at-50% maturity with time or population size. The relationship between the age- and length-at-50% maturity differs markedly between the three cod stocks (Irish.

However, so far, the number of practical cases of marine fisheries management using genetics has been limited. Here, we used Atlantic cod in the Baltic Sea to demonstrate the applicability of genetics to a complex management scenario involving mixing of two genetically divergent populations. Specifically, we addressed several assumptions used in the current assessment of the two populations. Through analysis of 483 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distributed across the Atlantic cod genome, we confirmed that a model of mechanical mixing, rather than hybridization and introgression, best explained the pattern of genetic differentiation. Thus, the fishery is best monitored as a mixed-stock fishery. Next, we developed a targeted panel of 39 SNPs with high statistical power for identifying population of origin and analyzed more than 2,000 tissue samples collected between 2011 and 2015 as well as 260 otoliths collected in 2003/2004. These data provided high spatial resolution and allowed us to investigate geographical trends in mixing, to compare patterns for different life stages and to investigate temporal trends in mixing. We found similar geographical trends for the two time points represented by tissue and otolith samples and that a recently implemented geographical management separation of the two populations provided a relatively close match to their distributions. In contrast to the current assumption, we found that patterns of mixing differed between juveniles and adults, a signal likely linked to the different reproductive dynamics of the two populations. Collectively, our data confirm that genetics is an operational tool for complex fisheries management applications.

The results show that abundance of fish >30 cm is presently extremely low for most long-lived species compared to historical records from the 1920s to 1970s. Cod, haddock, whiting, plaice. dab, long rough dab all showed a marked shift of the size spectra to the smaller sizes. Flounder was a notable exception: the size distribution had even widened and included more smaller as well as larger fish than in the historical records. Because flounder is the only long-lived species that is coast-bound and stationary, local fishing activity is apparently not responsible for the observed shift in the less stationary species. Also, fishing in the coastal zone has presumably been reduced because of the absence of the size range suitable for consumption, Overall. the demersal fish catches ere dominated by immature fish that disappear when they, grow, older and most likely migrate offshore, The persistently high abundance of juvenile fish and the absence of adult fish suggest that the inshore demersal fish Populations are presently regulated by recruitment from offshore sources. while historical information indicate that spawning aggregations of several of these species were common in these areas. It was hence hypothesized that a major change of the inshore demersal community has taken place during the last twenty years: local (sub-)populations of demersal fish have been eradicated. and the inshore area has become more and more dependent on transport of recruits from offshore spawning areas.

Clear trends in this reproductive parameter are observed along the time series and the potential factors affecting these trends have been investigated. Total biomass, different indexes of SSB, age diversity index, fishing mortality at age, NAO winter index, upwelling index and temperature were included in multiple regressions models to assess the relative importance of each of them on shifts in size at maturity. Bay of Biscay and Galician coast hake have followed different evolution in patterns of changes in size at maturity. In Bay of Biscay, a steadily decline of 15 cm has been observed from 1987 to 2004, which is well predicted by fishing mortality and age diversity, but also the environment may have played an important role. However, on the Galician coast a drastic decline of 16 cm from 1980 to 1988 was followed by a rapid increase in size at maturity during the next 10 years to original values and a stable period in the last 6 years. Decreasing biomass may explain the decline in size at maturity in the first period. However, total biomass and spawning biomass declined even during the period when size at maturity increased, which is contrary to compensatory theory. Shifts in environmental regime, NAO and upwelling, may have contributed to a decelerated growth during this period that might explain the later maturation. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

For each trawling location, environmental and geographical parameters were recorded, while biomass, abundance, biodiversity and size-based metrics were estimated for the total megafaunal community, as well as for four taxonomic sub-communities (Osteichthyes, Chondrichthyes, Crustacea and Cephalopoda) which were expected to respond differently to environmental changes and fishing. In addition, biomass and abundance of ten species selected based on commercial interest, depth range and life history traits were explored, with particular emphasis on deep-sea species. Fishing effort data collected during the study period were analysed and showed a decreasing trend, mainly due to a decrease in the activity of static nets. The relation between the estimated parameters and environmental and spatial factors, as well as temporal (interannual) effects and the effect of fishing effort were explored using generalized additive models (GAMs). Results of GAMs showed that depth and location explained much of the variation in community metrics, probably reflecting mesoscale spatial features and species/communities requirements. Even though the different communities and species exhibited variant patterns in bathymetric and spatial distribution, some common aggregation patterns in productive areas were identified. Despite the relatively short time series, GAMs were effective in detecting increasing trends for several metrics; taking into account spatial factors further contributed to attributing the remaining deviance to temporal effects. These trends were partly explained by the observed decline of fishing effort, which is further supported by the fact that negative relations between several metrics and fishing effort were identified, for some of the selected communities and populations.

Climatic and anthropogenic effects often interact leading to unexpected results. For example, climate may lead to a change in the spatial distribution of a fish stock and thereby its vulnerability to exploitation. The North Sea cod stock is currently under pressure from both environmental change and human exploitation. This stock has experienced a series of poor recruitments since the late 1990s and, concomitant with the decrease in abundance, the distribution of cod has changed. While it has been suggested that the change in distribution can be linked to increasing temperatures and fishing pressure, there is little evidence for this hypothesis. 2. Using winter and summer survey catches, we investigated whether a directional shift in the distribution of cod has taken place over the years 1983-2003. We then examined whether the change could be linked to climatic conditions, fishing mortality, stock size or limited directional movement of cod. Using the derived models, we investigated whether fishing has increased the sensitivity of the cod population to climate-induced distribution changes. 3. A series of winters characterized by high temperatures and southerly winds during the egg and larval phases of cod led to a northward shift in the distribution of juvenile North Sea cod the following year. A concomitant northern shift of mature fish around the time of spawning was linked directly to a tendency for northerly distributed juveniles to remain northerly throughout their life. This shift of the spawners further augmented that of the new recruits. 4. Although fishing mortality on a North Sea scale was not directly correlated with the displacement of any of the age groups, fishing has severely decreased the number of fish in older age groups. This increased the sensitivity of the distribution of the cod stock to climatic changes. 5. Synthesis and applications. The centre of gravity of North Sea cod has moved north as a result of the effect of a series of warm, windy winters on the distribution of recently settled cod. The shift was followed by a northwards shift in the distribution of older age groups. Unless a series of cold and calm years combined with a reduced mortality in the southern areas allows a southern spawning population to rebuild, the cod stock is unlikely to return to its previous area of distribution. Furthermore, protecting adult cod mainly in northern areas is unlikely to result in improved recruitment to the southern North Sea.",English,Article,"Green Submitted, Bronze",Web of Science,K,CS - North Sea,">100,000",multidecadal,"5,000-10,000",month,Regular Fisheries Independent Survey,Predictive model,2,2,3,"Although fishing mortality on a North Sea scale was not directly correlated with the displacement of any of the age groups, fishing has severely decreased the number of fish in older age groups.

As a prerequisite, we analyse here how this variability relates to population dynamics in conjunction with environmental conditions. For that, spatio-temporal statistical approaches are needed but seldom used in fisheries science. To fill this gap, we showcase the usefulness of the method of empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs). Guidelines are given to apply the method on a series of gridded maps as derived from fisheries survey data-series that now span over decades. The method is applied to the series, 2000-2012, of the spatial distributions of European anchovy in the Bay of Biscay at spawning time. Across the series, the EOF decomposition allowed to identify three main types of spatial distributions. One type corresponded to an extended distribution, another to a restricted distribution in core areas, and the third to a very coastal distribution. The coastal spawning distribution corresponded to a low population growth rate as it was never followed by a large recruitment in the subsequent year. We did not attempt to explain the spatial patterns per se but the drivers of change from one type of distribution to another. Stock size and fish size as well as bottom temperature and water column stratification were the covariates that controlled the variability in the spatial distributions over time. Further, the spatial distribution at spawning time related to recruitment in the following year, meaning that variability in the spatial distribution of spawning affected population dynamics.

Given the increasing use of these models, one must ask the question: How much faith can we have in their estimates? We briefly review mortality processes acting on marine fish early life stages and how IBMs have been used to estimate those processes. Next, we provide a summary of the sensitivity analyses and scenario results conducted in 50 studies that provided estimates of: 1) advection-based losses from drift modeling, 2) mortality due to starvation from foraging and growth modeling, and/or 3) modeled mortality due to predators. We illustrate how IBM estimates of larval distribution and survival can be sensitive to assumptions regarding the magnitude and timing of mortality by performing drift model simulations for Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) larvae in the North Sea. Despite the growing number of studies applying IBMs, less than 25% reviewed here included formal sensitivity analyses of parameters. Our literature review indicated a need for biological research on 1) larval swimming behavior including cues for movements, 2) foraging parameters such as larval visual field estimates, and 3) parameters associated with growth physiology including assimilation efficiency and energy losses due to active metabolism. Ontogenetic changes in those factors are particularly relevant to examine for modeling activities. Methods also need to be developed for depicting predator encounter in a dynamic way (e.g., based upon predator-prey overlap). High priority should be given to developing (and funding) research programs that not only construct and apply IBMs but also that measure the aspects of larval behavior and physiology as well as aspects of the larval environment needed to parameterize them. Coupling these research activities will strengthen our confidence in IBM-derived estimates of mortality and the processes responsible for death of larvae in the sea. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The work presented here, the spatial temporal data framework, is part of a larger study, the NF-UBC Nereus Program, to develop a new approach to model interoperability for closing the gap between marine ecosystem modeling tools via geographic information systems (GIS) technology. The approach we present simplifies interdisciplinary model interoperability by separating technical and scientific challenges into a flexible and modular software approach. To illustrate capabilities of the new framework, we use a remote-sensing derived spatial and temporal time series to drive the primary production dynamics in an existing food web model of the North-Central Adriatic using the Ecospace module of the Ecopath with Ecosim approach. In general, the predictive capabilities of the food web model to hind-cast ecosystem dynamics are enhanced when applying the new framework by better reflecting observed species population trends and distributions. Results show that changes at the phytoplankton level due to changes in primary production are realistically reproduced and cascade up the pelagic food web. The dynamics of zooplankton and small and large pelagic fish are impacted. Highly exploited demersal species such as European hake do, however, not show clear signs of cascading. This may be due to the high fishing pressure on this species and the resulting strong historical decline in the area. In general, the development of the new framework offers ecosystem modelers with unprecedented capabilities to include spatial temporal time series into food web analysis with a minimal set of required steps.

There are numerous ways of inferring spatial structures, and information from multiple methods is becoming more common to examine how different processes shape the spatial structures of species to improve fish management. Here, we investigate the spatial structure of a suite of Baltic Sea fish species based on the following: (i) spatial (presumably neutral) genetic differentiation, reviewed from the literature, and (ii) spatial synchrony in abundance changes from time series of fishery-independent surveys, which we currently find to be under-used given the amount of data available. For each of these two methods, species were classified as having a distinct, continuous or no/weak spatial structure. In addition, based on each source of information, we estimated the spatial scale of management units for species.

This requires accurate, highresolution habitat maps showing the spatial distribution of benthic assemblages and enabling intersections of habitats and anthropogenic activities. However, such detailed maps are often not available because relevant biological data are scarce or poorly integrated. Instead, physiotope maps, solely based on abiotic variables, are now often used in marine spatial planning. Here, we investigated how pointwise, relatively sparse biological data can be integrated with gridded, high-resolution environmental data into informative habitat maps, using the intensively used southern North Sea as a case-study. We first conducted hierarchical clustering to identify discrete biological assemblages for three faunal groups: demersal fish, epifauna, and endobenthos. Using Random Forest models with high-resolution abiotic predictors, we then interpolated the distribution of these assemblages to high resolution grids. Finally, we quantified different anthropogenic pressures for each habitat. Habitat maps comprised a different number of habitats between faunal groups (6, 13, and 10 for demersal fish, epifauna, and endobenthos respectively) but showed similar spatial patterns for each group. Several of these 'fauna-inclusive' habitats resembled physiotopes, but substantial differences were also observed, especially when few (6; demersal fish) or most (13; epifauna) physiotopes were delineated. Demersal fishing and offshore wind farms (OWFs) were clearly associated with specific habitats, resulting in unequal anthropogenic pressure between different habitats. Natura-2000 areas were not specifically associated with demersal fishing, but OWFs were situated mostly inside these protected areas.

Given the increasing use of these models, one must ask the question: How much faith can we have in their estimates? We briefly review mortality processes acting on marine fish early life stages and how IBMs have been used to estimate those processes. Next, we provide a summary of the sensitivity analyses and scenario results conducted in 50 studies that provided estimates of: 1) advection-based losses from drift modeling, 2) mortality due to starvation from foraging and growth modeling, and/or 3) modeled mortality due to predators. We illustrate how IBM estimates of larval distribution and survival can be sensitive to assumptions regarding the magnitude and timing of mortality by performing drift model simulations for Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) larvae in the North Sea. Despite the growing number of studies applying IBMs, less than 25% reviewed here included formal sensitivity analyses of parameters. Our literature review indicated a need for biological research on 1) larval swimming behavior including cues for movements, 2) foraging parameters such as larval visual field estimates, and 3) parameters associated with growth physiology including assimilation efficiency and energy losses due to active metabolism. Ontogenetic changes in those factors are particularly relevant to examine for modeling activities. Methods also need to be developed for depicting predator encounter in a dynamic way (e.g., based upon predator-prey overlap). High priority should be given to developing (and funding) research programs that not only construct and apply IBMs but also that measure the aspects of larval behavior and physiology as well as aspects of the larval environment needed to parameterize them.

In the North Sea, most sandeel fishing takes place on the Dogger Bank during spring. Here, we studied sandeel-fishery and sandeel-predatory fish interactions in 2 sampling grids, focussing on (1) how localised sandeels are distributed during the day (when feeding pelagically) and at night (when buried in the seabed); (2) how precisely the fishery can target localised sandeel concentrations; and (3) how tightly day/night sandeel distributions are linked to the local abundance of predatory fishes and their sandeel consumption. Sandeel abundance differed widely between both grids. Within each grid, marked day/night differences in distributions indicated extensive diurnal migrations, with centres of gravity of day and night distributions up to 15 km apart. Fishing effort was tightly matched with sandeel populations during the day and was far higher in the 'high sandeel density' grid. Only at the finest scale examined, effort was concentrated at sandbanks but not significantly matched with local sandeel numbers. This suggested either insufficient knowledge among fishers or vessel maneuverability issues, possibly relating to high mobility of sandeels. Ten predatory fishes (8 'human consumption' species) preyed on sandeels, most notably whiting and lesser weever. Spatial comparisons showed that the predominant sandeel predators were whiting during the day and lesser weever at night. Tight predator-prey interdependencies were revealed: whiting and weever exhibited 'aggregative responses' to sandeels, and most predators consumed more sandeels in the 'high sandeel density' grid.

On average, sea trout spent 42.3 % (+/- 5.0% SE) of their time in the fjord within the reserve, a proportion similar to the area of the reserve relative to that of the fjord. On average, sea trout tagged inside the reserve received the most protection, although the level of protection decreased marginally with increasing home range size. Furthermore, individuals tagged outside the reserve received more protection with increasing home range size, potentially opposing selection toward smaller home range sizes inflicted on fish residing within reserves, or through selective fishing methods like angling.

The responses to a given intensity of fishing disturbance can be influenced by the extent to which these species and communities are preconditioned to disturbance by natural processes, in particular waves and currents. The advent of vessel monitoring system (VMS) and models of natural disturbance enable high-resolution and large-scale comparisons of fishing and natural disturbance. VMS data were employed to estimate the trawled area per 12 km by 12 km grid cell. We then quantified natural disturbance by estimating the number of days in a year the seabed was disturbed by tides and waves. As natural disturbance acts on large spatial scales, we assumed that each natural disturbance event affects whole grid cells. Frequencies could thus be translated into an area of impact, allowing us to compare fishing with natural disturbance. We showhow such comparisons can be used to estimate the extent of different seabed substrate types significantly affected by demersal fishing. Ameasure of the probability that fishing disturbance exceeds natural disturbance provides onemetric for identifying areas of significant trawling impact on seabed habitats and might be used to measure progress towards achieving good environmental status for sea-floor integrity within the context of the European Union's Marine Strategy Framework Directive. For more than half the seabed in the English sector of the Greater North Sea, the results suggest that disturbance attributable to demersal fishing exceeds natural disturbance based on data from the years 2006 to 2008.

A life cycle approach was used to quantify the relative influence of these stressors on the Eastern English Channel (EEC) population of the common sole (Solea solea), a coastal-nursery dependent flatfish population which sustains important fisheries. The common sole has a complex life cycle: after eggs hatch, larvae spend several weeks drifting in open water. Survivors go on to metamorphose into benthic fish. Juveniles spend the first two years of their life in coastal and estuarine nurseries. Close to maturation, they migrate to deeper areas, where different subpopulations supplied by different nurseries reproduce and are exploited by fisheries. A spatially structured age-and stage-based hierarchical Bayesian model integrating various aspects of ecological knowledge, data sources and expert knowledge was built to quantitatively describe this complex life cycle. The model included the low connectivity among three subpopulations in the EEC, the influence of hydrographic variability, the availability of suitable juvenile habitat and fisheries. Scenarios were designed to quantify the effects of interacting stressors on population renewal. Results emphasized the importance of coastal nursery habitat availability and quality for the population renewal. Realistic restoration scenarios of the highly degraded Seine estuary produced a two-third increase in catch potential for the adjacent subpopulation. Fisheries, however, remained the main source of population depletion. Setting fishing mortality to the maximum sustainable yield led to substantial increases in biomass (+100%) and catch (+33%) at the EEC scale. The approach also showed how climate-driven variability in hydrography is likely to interact with human pressures, e.g., overfishing increased the sensitivity to unfavourable conditions. Our results provided insights into the dynamics of numerous exploited coastal-nursery-dependent species while paving the way toward more robust advice for sustainable management of these resources.

The impact of the effort displacement on the fish stocks and the vessels' economic consequences were evaluated by simulating individual choices of vessel speed, fishing grounds, and ports. Some scenarios led to increased energy efficiency and profit while others such as fishing closures or fishermen optimization sometimes lowered the revenue by altering the spatiotemporal effort allocation.

A major challenge for fisheries managers is to be able to anticipate how fishing effort is re-allocated following any permanent or seasonal closure of fishing grounds, given the competition for space with other active maritime sectors. In this study, a Random Utility Model (RUM) was applied to determine how fishing effort is allocated spatially and temporally by the French demersal mixed fleet fishing in the Eastern English Channel. The explanatory variables chosen were past effort i.e. experience or habit, previous catch to represent previous success, % of area occupied by spatial regulation, and by other competing maritime sectors. Results showed that fishers tended to adhere to past annual fishing practices, except the fleet targeting molluscs which exhibited within year behaviour influenced by seasonality. Furthermore, results indicated French and English scallop fishers share the same fishing grounds, and maritime traffic may impact on fishing decision. Finally, the model was validated by comparing predicted re-allocation of effort against observed effort, for which there was a close correlation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We modelled the potential distribution for different life stages of commercially and ecologically important species, as a high-resolution indicator of the distribution of essential fish habitats. Model outputs were combined with observed, low-resolution fish distributions to derive 'hotspot' spawning and nursery areas.

High pressure from human activities is expected to impact EFHs in the English Channel and the central-east Celtic Sea.

Spatial plans require appropriate scales, reliable maps of sites important to marine organisms. We present maps of hotspots of Essential Fish Habitats (EFH) at a high spatial resolution for English and Welsh waters. These outputs can be integrated into an improved spatial plan for these waters. We modelled the potential distribution for different life stages of commercially and ecologically important species, as a high-resolution indicator of the distribution of essential fish habitats. Model outputs were combined with observed, low-resolution fish distributions to derive 'hotspot' spawning and nursery areas. The Celtic Sea and coastal areas of the North Sea are highlighted as important spawning and nursery grounds. High pressure from human activities is expected to impact EFHs in the English Channel and the central-east Celtic Sea. Our approach maintains the high resolution of the model-derived maps while filling in information gaps. As fish share essential habitat preferences, protected hotspot areas are expected to sustain a multitude of species. Overlaying human activities, such as fishing, on the hotspot maps allows managers to identify areas of conservation interest and apply appropriate measures.

While offshore cod stocks still were abundant and productive, the Swedish west coast showed signs of diminishing adult cod abundance at the beginning of the 1980s, where the local cod component was considered to be extirpated. To survey the present cod spawning activity and stock composition, we initiated egg trawling over two consecutive years (203 hauls in total) in combination with population genetic analyses (425 individually genotyped eggs). Here, we provide evidence of cod spawning at the Swedish Skagerrak coast, suggesting recolonization or that local cod has recovered from a nearly depleted state. Early stage eggs were found inside fjords too far to have been transported by oceanic drift from offshore spawning areas. The cod eggs were genetically similar in early to late life-stages and cluster mainly with the local adult cod, indicating that eggs and adults belong to the same genetic unit. The cod eggs were genetically differentiated from adult North Sea cod, and, to a lesser degree, also from the Kattegat and oresund cod, i.e. indicating a possible recovery of local coastal stock. The patterns of the genetic structure in the inshore areas are, however, difficult to fully disentangle, as Atlantic cod in the North Sea-Skagerrak area seem to be a mixture of co-existing forms: local cod completing their entire life cycle in fjords and sheltered areas, and oceanic populations showing homing behaviours. The egg abundances are considerably lower compared with what is found in similar studies along the Norwegian Skagerrak coast.

However, recent studies have shown that internal characteristics and external forcing (climate and exploitation) have interactive rather than additive effects. Thought most of these studies explored how demographic truncation induced by exploitation affected the response of recruitment to climate, identifying a general pattern revealed to be difficult as interactions are often case-specific. Here we compared five exploited stocks of European hake Merluccius merluccius from the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea to investigate how the interaction between internal characteristics and external forces affect the variability of the population growth rate and their consequences on recruitment. Our results show that demographic truncation induces a novel population scenario in which the growth rate is maximized when the reproductive stock is younger and less diverse. This scenario is shaped by the climate variability and the fishing pattern. The population growth rate becomes more dependent on the maturation schedule and less on the survival rates. The consequences for the recruitment dynamics are twofold; the effect of density-dependent regulatory processes decreases while the effect of the density-independent drivers increases. Our study shows that the interaction between internal characteristics and external forces changes across geographic locations according to 1) the importance of demographic truncation, 2) the influence of the climate on the regional hydrography and 3) the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the physical environment to which fish life history is adapted.",English,Article,Green Published,Web of Science,EXCLUDE on lack of spatial context,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indicators are required to support the development of this approach. For example, community indicators have been proposed to assess the impact of fishing. We tested here the applicability of one such community indicator, the abundance-biomass comparison (ABC method), as a measure of the impact of bottom trawling (years of sampling: 2001 and 2003) on the benthic invertebrates-typically starfishes, crabs, squat lobsters, shrimps and large hard-shelled molluscs-of Grande Vasiere, a major French fishing zone, in the Bay of Biscay. The ABC method is generally used as an impact indicator for different types of physical, biological and anthropogenic disturbances on benthic communities. This method is based on the assumption that increasing disturbance shifts communities from dominance by large-bodied species with low turnover rates toward dominance by small-bodied species with high turnover rates. At less disturbed areas the average biomass of individuals is greater than at more heavily disturbed areas. The ABC method measures this effect by comparing the ranked distributions of abundance and biomass within a given community. We applied the ABC method and compared the size structure and the species diversity at two areas exposed to moderate and high bottom trawl effort. Species diversity was lower in the most exploited area. The highly trawled area was dominated by opportunistic organisms, mainly one species of swimming crab Liocarcinus depurator, one species of squat lobster Munida rugosa and Norway lobsters Nephrops norvegicus, which are large-bodied species.

For each of these three bathymetric strata, we simultaneously analysed 12 indices that are theoretically complementary and relate to 4 diversity components: (1) the number of species, (2) rarity, (3) evenness and (4) taxonomic diversity. Principal component analysis based on Spearman's correlation coefficients was carried out to investigate empirical relationships between the selected indices.

The spatio-temporal persistence of the high-density aggregations (hot spots) of juvenile individuals in their first year of life was investigated to identify habitats that serve as nurseries. The density of recruits within the persistent nurseries was used as a proxy of the unit area contribution of individuals which recruit to the adult population. The spatial distribution patterns of the recruits of most the species were well defined and very stable in the long term. Persistent and potentially highly productive nurseries of European hake, deep-water rose shrimp and greater forkbeard were identified off the southern coast of Sicily.

This study provides fisheries-independent, baseline information on the structure and diversity of the demersal fish assemblages of the continental shelf and upper slope off the island of Psara (Central Aegean Sea). Experimental bottom trawl hauls were conducted during 2009-2010, using identically designed trawls. All the fish in the catches were identified onboard, enumerated, and weighted to the nearest g. Species abundance and biomass were transformed to CPUE. Forty-seven taxa were identified in the catches. For 18 of the species caught no other fisheries-independent information on their abundances and distributions is available for the wider area. Among the Elasmobranchii species collected, Squalus acanthias, Dipturus oxyrinchus, and Raja clavata are species of conservation concern. Species composition was generally more similar to that reported for assemblages of the Cretan Sea and the South Aegean Sea than for assemblages of the North Aegean.

This investigation examines changes in population dynamics of two gadoid species in the Skagerrak- northeastern North Sea on a century scale, and argues that long-term, historical abundance estimates are relevant to the determination of biomass reference points in fisheries management. Situated within the field of historical ecology, this paper presents findings on the abundance of ling and cod in 1872. Calculations are based on historical CPUE and catch data. Ling abundance was ca. 100-200 million individuals aged 4+ and probably exceeded cod abundances (ca. 3 million individuals aged 3+) in the Skagerrak and in the northeastern North Sea in 1872. Current ling abundances are unknown but probably lower than in 1872, as reflected in declining landings during the late 1990s-early 2000s. Dominating ling size has also declined since the late 19th century. The estimated historic abundance of cod in the Skagerrak and northeastern North Sea is similar to present abundance of cod in these areas but its spatial distribution has contracted. These changes in the ling and cod populations are consistent with effects of fishing on populations and should be considered when setting fishery management plans for population recovery and sustainability.

How complexities inherent to real populations affect migration was exemplified by Atlantic cod in the North Sea and Skagerrak and was examined within an age-structured model that incorporated genetic markers. Migration was determined under various scenarios by varying the number of simulated migrants until the mean simulated level of genetic differentiation matched a fixed level of genetic differentiation equal to empirical estimates. Parameters that decreased the N-e/N-t ratio (where N-e is the effective and N-t is the total population size), such as high fishing mortality and high fishing gear selectivity, increased the number of migrants required to achieve empirical levels of genetic differentiation. Higher maturity-at-age and lower selectivity increased N-e/N-t and decreased migration when genetic differentiation was fixed. Changes in natural mortality, fishing gear selectivity, and maturity-at-age within expected limits had a moderate effect on migration when genetic differentiation was held constant.

Furthermore, our model scenarios suggest that while fishing largely contributed to the abrupt stock decline during the late 1990s and the following period of low biomass, a complete recovery of the stock to the highly productive levels of the early 1980s would only be possible through changes in the surrounding ecosystem, involving lower temperatures and improved feeding conditions.

However, the overall consequences are still hard to predict because behaviour, genetic adaptation, habitat dependency and the impacts of fishing on species, result in complex species' responses that may be only partially explained by simple climate envelope predictions. There is a broad body of evidence that climatic fluctuations are playing an important role in changing fish distributions and abundances, which is discernible against the background of trends in abundance due to fishing. During warm periods, southern species have tended to become more prominent and northern species less abundant. However, the changes in distribution are often more complicated than might be expected from a simple climate envelope approach, partly due to ocean circulation patterns which create invasion routes for southern water species into the North Sea from the south and from the north via the continental shelf west of Britain and Ireland. The eventual population-scale impacts of ocean acidification on fish and shellfish are currently very difficult to predict. However, the scant evidence suggests that indirect food web effects arising from the enhanced sensitivity of calcifying planktonic organisms may be important, and the direct effect on fish sensory systems leading to subtle influences on behaviour with possible population-level implications are possible. In British waters, the lesser sandeel (Ammodytes marinus) is identified as being at particular risk from climate change. Owing to its strict association with coarse sandy sediments it is unable to adapt its distribution to compensate for warming sea temperatures.

We traced the lipids, using fatty acid trophic markers (FATM), from the herring feeding grounds in the North Sea to the cod livers in the Western Baltic Sea. Time series analysis of population dynamics indicated that population-level production of cod is positively affected by the herring subsidies. However, the underlying mechanisms were more complicated than anticipated. During the herring season, large cod received most of its dietary lipids from the herring, whereas smaller cod were prevented from accessing the lipid pool due to a mismatch in predator-prey size ratio. Furthermore, while the herring were extremely rich in bulk energy, they were surprisingly poor in a specific functional fatty acid. Hence, our study was the first to illustrate how the magnitude cross-system fluxes of subsidies in migrant-resident systems are potentially constrained by the size structure of the resident predator population and the nutritional quality of the migrants.",English,Article,"gold, Green Published",Web of Science,EXCLUDE on lack of spatial context,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we evaluated the sensitivity of an Ecospace model developed for the North Sea ecosystem to some of its key parameters, and we examined this model's capability to reproduce trends in spatial time-series of fish biomass and fishing effort. We measured the fit between the spatiotemporal model predictions and the corresponding data of biomass for 12 species and effort for three fishing fleets. Our results suggest that the Ecospace model for the North Sea can predict quite successfully the species distribution, but not the distribution of fishing effort. We hypothesise that the reason might be that Ecospace assumes spatial effort distribution to be driven mainly by profit, while other factors might be more important in our system at the spatiotemporal scale explored. The model might thus fail to capture fisher's behaviour accurately for this system. Despite the limitations of our ad hoc approach for sensitivity analysis, these results hint that some problems exist in our model, which might extend to other Ecospace models and perhaps to the framework in general.

We suggest that, in order to make of Ecospace a more robust tool for management advice, some critical improvements are needed: the development of an algorithm for parameter optimisation through fitting the model predictions to data, and advancement of the effort distribution model.

Ballast waters and escape from aquaculture are the most important invasion vectors. During the last decade, an invasion of the round goby (Neogobius rnelanostomus) - a Ponto-Caspian fish species has been observed in the Gulf of Gdansk. The first record of this fish in the Baltic Sea is from 1990. Early detection of the invader enabled the study of population growth and changes in the area. The first years of invasion were characterized by low numbers of individuals and a limited distribution. Later, the round goby gradually colonized all shallow waters in the western part of the Gulf of Gdansk. Initially the fish inhabited stony and rocky habitats, but later it also occupied sandy bottoms. The round goby is now the dominating fish species in most of the shallow waters of the Gulf of Gdansk. Two main factors account for the successful invasion of this fish in the region: the state of ecosystem at the time of the invasion and the biological features of N. melanostomus. In the late 1980s, the shallow waters of the Gulf of Gdansk were almost devoid of piscivorous fishes. Concurrently, bivalves (a preferred prey of the round goby) have increased.

In fisheries that fail to meet fishing mortality targets, closed areas are sometimes implemented to reduce fishing mortality. However, fisheries with stronger management, including rights-based approaches that can address overcapacity and overfishing problems, often employ spatial management as well. Here, we compare the objectives, design, and performance of spatial management in nine temperate demersal fisheries in North America, Oceania, Europe, and Africa that employ rights-based systems. Common objectives of spatial management included protecting habitat, juveniles, and spawners and reducing discards. Recovering age structure and creating scientific reference sites were less common objectives, despite being widely cited benefits of spatial management. Some fisheries adopted single closures to achieve single objectives, whereas others adopted diverse networks to achieve multiple objectives. Importantly, many spatial protections are implemented primarily through industry initiatives. Environmental change compromised the efficacy of spatial management in some cases, suggesting the need to design spatial management systems that are robust to changing ocean conditions. Fisheries with diverse and extensive spatial management systems have generally healthier fish stocks. Whether this implies that spatial management contributed substantially to fishery performance is unclear due to an absence of large-scale, long-term studies aimed at discerning different drivers of success. Although these targeted monitoring studies of closed areas are limited, such studies are necessary to help resolve the ongoing debate and to enable more purposeful design of spatial management for fisheries and conservation.",English,Article,Bronze,Web of Science,EXCLUDE on document type,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both natural and anthropogenic drivers are well known to affect organisms' distributions; however, it often remains unclear where along a range of environmental and anthropogenic gradients important compositional community changes occur. We used a big-data approach, including over 175,000 presence records of benthic genera for the North Sea, to identify environmental (bed shear stress, sediment grain size, temperature) and anthropogenic parameters (trawling effort) driving benthic community composition over a 21-year period. We applied a Gradient Forest analysis, based on Random Forests, to estimate the locations and importance of thresholds where small cumulative increases in the predictors drive a much greater change in genus composition than would be expected from linear effects. Shear stress was the most important predictor of benthic community composition. Trawling effort, temperature gradients and sediment grain size were of intermediate importance. This corroborates that current and wave effects (typically associated with seabed substrate types) are primary determinants of benthic communities. Our results suggest that a genus composition threshold for both infauna and epifaunal benthic communities is crossed when the seafloor is trawled as little as once every 4 years. Higher trawling levels corresponded with gradual compositional change without obvious thresholds, which would be consistent with chronic fishing in the North Sea over the last two centuries having caused persistent, long-term changes in ecosystem structure and functioning. This was corroborated by the large-scale spatial patterns of benthic community composition undergoing limited temporal changes during the 21-year study period. Synthesis and applications. Although well established in theory, threshold effects are poorly validated in the field. We generated new information on multi-organism responses to environmental change at the scale of a continental shelf ecosystem and over a multi-decadal time period.

Growth performance in cod is optimal at temperatures close to 10 degreesC, regardless of the population investigated in a latitudinal cline. However, temperature specific growth rates decrease at higher latitudes. Also, fecundity is less in White Sea than in North and Baltic Sea cod or eelpout populations. These findings suggest that a cold-induced shift in energy budget occurs which is unfavorable for growth performance and fecundity. Thermal tolerance limits shift depending on latitude and are characterized by oxygen limitation at both low or high temperatures. Oxygen supply to tissues is optimized at low temperature by a shift in hemoglobin isoforms and oxygen binding properties to lower affinities and higher unloading potential. Protective stimulation of heat shock protein synthesis was not observed. According to a recent model of thermal tolerance the downward shift of tolerance limits during cold adaptation is associated with rising mitochondrial densities and, thus, aerobic capacity and performance in the cold. especially in eurythermal species. At the same time the costs of mitochondrial maintenance reflected by mitochondrial proton leakage should rise leaving a lower energy fraction for growth and reproduction. The preliminary conclusion can be drawn that warming will cause a northern shift of distribution limits for both species with a rise in growth performance and fecundity larger than expected from the Q(10) effect in the north and lower growth or even extinction of the species in the south. Such a shift may heavily affect fishing activities in the North Sea. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this chapter, we describe the geographic distributions of this important predator of North Atlantic ecosystems and document extensive evidence for limitations of spatial movement and local adaptation from population genetic markers and electronic tagging. Taken together, this evidence demonstrates that knowledge of spatial population ecology is critical for evaluating the effects of climate change and commercial harvesting. To explore the possible effects of climate change on cod, we first describe thermal influences on individual physiology, growth, activity and maturation. We then evaluate evidence that temperature has influenced population-level processes including direct effects on recruitment through enhanced growth and activity, and indirect effects through changes to larval food resources. Although thermal regimes clearly define the biogeographic range of the species, and strongly influence many aspects of cod biology, the evidence that population declines across the North Atlantic are strongly linked to fishing activity is now overwhelming. Although there is considerable concern about low spawning stock biomasses, high levels of fishing activity continues in many areas. Even with reduced fishing effort, the potential for recovery from low abundance may be compromised by unfavourable climate and Allee effects. Current stock assessment and management approaches are reviewed, alongside newly advocated methods for monitoring stock status and recovery. However, it remains uncertain whether the rebuilding of cod to historic population sizes and demographic structures will be possible in a warmer North Atlantic.",English,Review_Book Chapter,,Web of Science,EXCLUDE on lack of spatial context,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An extensive sampling of nearly 10000 otoliths over 25 years has been collected during annual bottom trawl surveys in southern Bay of Biscay and Galician waters. Samples were aged and yearly age-length-keys (ALKs) were built. A matrix of abundance indices by age and year was obtained after applying each ALK to their respective length distribution. The current age estimation criterion using otoliths of megrim was corroborated by tracking year-class abundance indices in the surveys. The strength of the year-classes was well tracked and significant correlations between abundance of consecutive age-groups from the same cohort were obtained. Von Bertalanffy growth parameters were estimated for the time-series (Lt = 56 [1-e((-0.12(t+1.82))]), and the growth performance indices estimated were within the range previously found for megrim in Bay of Biscay and nearby waters. These new parameters are representative of the growth of the Atlantic Iberian megrim stock (ICES Div. 8.c and 9.a) and can be used as a proxy of annual direct ageing in the assessment of this stock. Findings indicate that growth and mortality of the year-classes may influence population size/age structure of megrim. Abundant year-classes of megrim reach small mean lengths at the first fully recruited age 1, showing high mortality in the following older age-groups of the year-classes, and vice versa in the scarce year-classes. These results, together with the evidence of the inverse relationship between abundance and mean length by age of the year-classes, have showed, for the first time, evidence of density-dependent growth and mortality in the juvenile stage of megrim. The higher or smaller mean size and abundance of a year-class of megrim is determined by processes that take place in their first life stages and is maintained throughout the older age-groups of the year-class. The existence in consecutive years of cohorts showing small (1990s), or high (2000s) mean lengths-at-age, seems to indicate that growth in the first life stages may be conditioned by multiannual events in which occur favorable environmental and feeding conditions. Abundance is the most significant factor explaining the growth of age 1, whereas the climate index, used as environmental proxy, represented low relevance, and the fishing effort has no explanatory effect.",English,Article,,Web of Science,EXCLUDE on lack of spatial context,CS - Western Waters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A suite of 143 potential indicators, including spatial indices, representing small pelagic fish and their biotic and abiotic environments are presented. Indicators were routinely derived from the PELGAS integrated ecosystem survey conducted in spring in the Bay of Biscay (BoB). The general patterns over time in this suite of 5-16 years, non-stationary time series are characterised using a methodology based on min-max autocorrelation factors (MAF), to select the most continuous indicators within, and across, several ecosystem components: hydrology, phytoplankton, mesozooplankton, small pelagic fish and megafauna. Potential interactions between selected indicators and external forcing variables, including climate and fishing, were assessed. The results confirm the importance of river discharges, bottom temperature, chlorophyll-a and mesozooplankton biomass in the dynamics of the BoB pelagic ecosystem. Small pelagic fish species appear to have followed distinct trajectories during the last 15 years. A marked decrease in anchovy and sardine mean weights at ages 1 and 2 over the last 15 years was highlighted; potentially caused by density-dependent competition. The quasi-absence of significant correlation between selected survey indicators and climate and fishing pressure proxies suggests a moderate exploitation rate of small pelagic fish resources, and confirms the so far limited effects of large-scale climate forcing on the BoB pelagic ecosystem.

Single pressures are rare and, in the future, models must be able to examine multiple factors affecting living marine resources such as interactions between: i) climate-driven changes in temperature regimes and acidification, ii) reductions in water quality due to eutrophication, iii) the introduction of alien invasive species, and/or iv) (over-)exploitation by fisheries. Statistical (correlative) approaches can be used to detect historical patterns which may not be relevant in the future. Advancing predictive capacity of changes in distribution and productivity of living marine resources requires explicit modelling of biological and physical mechanisms. New formulations are needed which (depending on the question) will need to strive for more realism in ecophysiology and behaviour of individuals, life history strategies of species, as well as trophodynamic interactions occurring at different spatial scales. Coupling existing models (e.g. physical, biological, economic) is one avenue that has proven successful. However, fundamental advancements are needed to address key issues such as the adaptive capacity of species/groups and ecosystems. The continued development of end-to-end models (e.g., physics to fish to human sectors) will be critical if we hope to assess how multiple pressures may interact to cause changes in living marine resources including the ecological and economic costs and trade-offs of different spatial management strategies. Given the strengths and weaknesses of the various types of models reviewed here, confidence in projections of changes in the distribution and productivity of living marine resources will be increased by assessing model structural uncertainty through biological ensemble modelling.

This study analyzes fisheries-induced changes in life-history traits describing growth, maturation, and reproduction, using an individual-based eco-genetic model that captures both the population dynamics and changes in genetic trait values. The model was successfully calibrated to match the observed life-history traits of female North Sea plaice Pleuronectes platessa around the years 1900 and 2000. On this basis, we report the following findings. First, the model indicates changes in 3 evolving life-history traits: the intercept of the maturation reaction norm decreases by 27%, the weight-specific reproductive-investment rate increases by 10%, and the weight-specific energy-acquisition rate increases by 1%. Together, these changes reduce the weight at maturation by 46% and the asymptotic body weight by 28% relative to the intensification of fishing around 1900. Second, while the maturation reaction norm and reproductive-investment rate change monotonically over time, the energy-acquisition rate follows a more complex course: after an initial increase during the first 50 yr, it remains constant for about 30 yr and then starts to decline. Third, our analysis indicates that North Sea plaice has not yet attained a new evolutionary equilibrium: it must be expected to evolve further towards earlier maturation, increased reproductive investment, and lower adult body size. Fourth, when fishing continues in our model 100 yr into the future, the pace of evolution slows down for the maturation reaction norm and the rate of energy acquisition, whereas no such slowing down is expected for the rate of reproductive investment.",English,Article,,Web of Science,EXCLUDE on lack of spatial context,CS - North Sea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oceanatmospheric changes caused by greenhouse gas emissions are likely to affect future fish and shellfish production, and lead to increasing challenges in ensuring long-term sustainable fisheries management. The paper reviews existing knowledge and understanding of the exposure of marine ecosystems to ocean-atmospheric changes, the consequences of these changes for marine fisheries in the UK and Ireland, and the adaptability of the UK and Irish fisheries sector. Ocean warming is resulting in shifts in the distribution of exploited species and is affecting the productivity of fish stocks and underlying marine ecosystems. In addition, some studies suggest that ocean acidification may have large potential impacts on fisheries resources, in particular shell-forming invertebrates. These changes may lead to loss of productivity, but also the opening of new fishing opportunities, depending on the interactions between climate impacts, fishing grounds and fleet types. They will also affect fishing regulations, the price of fish products and operating costs, which in turn will affect the economic performance of the UK and Irish fleets. Key knowledge gaps exist in our understanding of the implications of climate and ocean chemistry changes for marine fisheries in the UK and Ireland, particularly on the social and economic responses of the fishing sectors to climate change. However, these gaps should not delay climate change mitigation and adaptation policy actions, particularly those measures that clearly have other co-benefits.

Complementary to the use of research vessel data, platforms of opportunity can be a powerful strategy to monitor species distributions at high temporal and spatial resolution. In this study we use data from commercial fishing vessels, collecting - under the European Union data collection framework - biological data on all species that are caught and subsequently discarded. Using such discard data in combination with a systematic trawl survey, we model the spatial and temporal distribution of juvenile plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) in the central North Sea. There is a clear age-dependent difference between the commercial fishing vessel data and the research vessel data, with age 1 being the dominating age in the survey catches, while age 2 is the dominating age in the discards. The results show how immature plaice, slowly migrate from the nursery areas, westwards into the deeper regions of the North Sea. Also, the results show that during the study period, juvenile plaice gradually moved to deeper waters at an earlier age. Finally we discuss how the framework can be applied to similar opportunistic data to monitor seasonal and inter-annual migration of marine organisms, and to quantify how they may be influenced by biotic and abiotic gradients, such as temperature.

However, there are few examples which demonstrate its practical implementation. Much of this relates to the history of existing marine monitoring and assessment programmes which (for many countries) are sectoral, making it difficult to integrate monitoring data and knowledge across programmes at the operational level. To address this, a scientific expert group, under the auspices of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), prepared a plan for how ICES could contribute to the development of an Integrated Ecosystem Assessment (IEA) for the North Sea by undertaking a pilot study utilising marine monitoring data. This paper presents the main findings arising from the expert group and in particular it sets out one possible integrated approach for assessing the relative significance of environmental forcing and fishing pressure on the ecological status of the North Sea, it then compares the findings with assessments made of other Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs). We define the North Sea ecosystem on the basis of 114 state and pressure variables resolved as annual averages between 1983 and 2003 and at the spatial scale of ICES rectangles. The paper presents results of integrated time-series and spatial analysis which identifies and explains significant spatial and temporal gradients in the data. For example, a significant shift in the status of the North Sea ecosystem (based upon 114 state-pressure variables) is identified to have occurred around 1993. This corresponds to previously documented shifts in the environmental conditions (particularly sea surface temperature) and changes in the distribution of key species of plankton (Calanus sp.), both reported to have occurred in 1989. The difference in specific timing between reported regime shifts for the North Sea may be explained, in part, by time-lag dependencies in the trophic structure of the ecosystem with shifts in higher trophic levels occurring later than 1989. By examining the connection (or relatedness) between ecosystem components (e.g. environment, plankton, fish, fishery and seabirds) for the identified regime states (1983-1993; 1993-2003) we conclude that both the North Sea pelagic and benthic parts of the ecosystem were predominantly top-down (fishery) controlled between 1983 and 1993, whereas between 1993 and 2003 the pelagic stocks shifted to a state responding mainly to bottom-up (environment) influences. However, for the demersal fish stocks between 1993 and 2003 top-down (fishery) pressure dominated even though over this period significant reductions in fishing pressure occurred. The present analysis, therefore, provides further evidence in support of the need for precautionary management measures taken in relation to setting fishery quotas.

Most ectotherms such as fish are expected to adjust their behaviour to avoid extreme temperatures and minimize acute changes in body temperature. In coastal Skagerrak, Norway, sea surface temperature (SST) ranges seasonally from 0 to over 20 degrees C, representing a challenge to the fish community which includes cold-, cool- and warm-water affinity species. By acoustically tracking 111 individuals of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua, pollack Pollachius pollachius and ballan wrasse Labrus bergylta in 2015-2018, we examined how coexisting species within a fish community adjusted their behaviour (i.e. vertical distribution in the water column and habitat selection) to cope with the thermal variation. Mixed-effect models showed that thermal preference was a main driver of behaviour and habitat use of the fish community in a southern Norwegian fjord. Cod used colder waters, compared with pollack and ballan wrasse. Increases in SST during summer were associated with the use of deeper, colder waters by cod, especially by larger individuals, and conversely with the occupancy of shallower areas by pollack and ballan wrasse. During winter, when SST dropped and the thermal stratification reversed, pollack and ballan wrasse moved to deeper, relatively warmer areas, while cod selected shallower, colder habitats. Although habitat selection was affected by temperature, species-specific habitat selection was observed even when temperature was similar throughout habitats. This study shows how cohabiting fish species respond to thermal heterogeneity, suggesting that (a) temperature regulates the access to the different depths and habitats and (b) behavioural plasticity may be an important factor for coping with temperature variability and potentially for adaptation to climate change.",English,Article,,Web of Science,EXCLUDE on Region,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Study focussing exclusively on the Skagerak region

As ectotherms, fish are being challenged to adapt or track changes in their environment, either in time through a phenological shift or in space by a biogeographic shift. Past modelling efforts have largely been based on correlative Species Distribution Models, which use known occurrences of species across landscapes of interest to define sets of conditions under which species are likely to maintain populations. The practical advantages of this correlative approach are its simplicity and the flexibility in terms of data requirements. However, effective conservation management requires models that make projections beyond the range of available data. One way to deal with such an extrapolation is to use a mechanistic approach based on physiological processes underlying climate change effects on organisms. Here we illustrate two approaches for developing physiology-based models to characterize fish habitat suitability. (i) Aerobic Scope Models (ASM) are based on the relationship between environmental factors and aerobic scope (defined as the difference between maximum and standard (basal) metabolism). This approach is based on experimental data collected by using a number of treatments that allow a function to be derived to predict aerobic metabolic scope from the stressor/environmental factor(s). This function is then integrated with environmental (oceanographic) data of current and future scenarios. For any given species, this approach allows habitat suitability maps to be generated at various spatiotemporal scales. The strength of the ASM approach relies on the estimate of relative performance when comparing, for example, different locations or different species. (ii) Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) models are based on first principles including the idea that metabolism is organised in the same way within all animals. The (standard) DEB model aims to describe empirical relationships which can be found consistently within physiological data across the animal kingdom. The advantages of the DEB models are that they make use of the generalities found in terms of animal physiology and can therefore be applied to species for which little data or empirical observations are available. In addition, the limitations as well as useful potential refinements of these and other physiology-based modelling approaches are discussed. Inclusion of the physiological response of various life stages and modelling the patterns of extreme events observed in nature are suggested for future work. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In the past, decadal-scale climate variations have been shown to strongly influence productivity and distributions of fish stocks. The importance of such shorter-term variations are expected to continue also under global warming.

Genotypes were used to assess the species' contemporary population structure, estimate effective population sizes and identify putative signals of selection in relation to environmental variables using a seascape genomics approach.

Effective population sizes were largest in the Celtic Sea and Rockall, but low enough to be of potential conservation concern among Scottish and Faroese sites.

There are numerous ways of inferring spatial structures, and information from multiple methods is becoming more common to examine how different processes shape the spatial structures of species to improve fish management. Here, we investigate the spatial structure of a suite of Baltic Sea fish species based on the following: (i) spatial (presumably neutral) genetic differentiation, reviewed from the literature, and (ii) spatial synchrony in abundance changes from time series of fishery-independent surveys, which we currently find to be under-used given the amount of data available. For each of these two methods, species were classified as having a distinct, continuous or no/weak spatial structure. In addition, based on each source of information, we estimated the spatial scale of management units for species. The results show that only among species confined to the coastal zone the two sources of information yielded a congruence of the spatial structure (displaying a continuous spatial structure). In contrast, offshore species show weak spatial genetic structure but stronger spatial structure of synchrony in abundance. Based on this, we suggest that population genetic structure and synchrony in abundance should be used as complementary information as they reflect different spatial processes and suggest that management actions should differ with respect to scale depending on the management targets applied.

Although North Sea fish stocks are monitored regularly, benthic fauna are not. Here, we report the results of a survey carried out in 2000, in which five nations sampled the epibenthic and fish fauna at 270 stations throughout the North Sea. The aim of the survey was to investigate the diversity and community structure of epibenthic and fish communities and to identify relationships with environmental factors, including the frequency of commercial otter and beam trawling disturbance. Epibenthic species diversity was lower in the southern North Sea than in central and northern areas. Fish, conversely, were more diverse in the south. The 50 m, 100 m and 200 m depth contours broadly defined the boundaries of benthic and fish communities. The abundance of epibenthos of the southern North Sea was dominated by free-living species, whilst north of the 50 m contour sessile species prevailed. A hybrid area, with sessile species typical of the north and free-living species characteristic of the south, was found off the Norfolk and Flamborough coast stretching towards the Dogger Bank. Large-scale hydrodynamic phenomena were most likely to be responsible for the main divisions between communities, especially the boundary between mixed and stratified water masses. However, bottom temperature, sediment parameters and beam trawling were closely correlated with species richness and diversity, as well as community patterns, and may modify regional species composition. Our study shows that effective large-scale sampling of benthic communities can be conducted during existing fisheries surveys. Since annual fisheries surveys are conducted throughout the northeast Atlantic shelf seas, concurrent benthic surveys would allow benthic sampling on unprecedented spatial and temporal scales. The samples would help to monitor the environmental impacts of trawling disturbance, climate change, pollution and other natural and anthropogenic factors.

One hundred and ninety-eight household questionnaires provided a coarse indication of effort distribution of artisanal lobster fishers around the Corn Islands, and 32 semi-structured interviews with skippers were used to map individual fishing sites and describe the operating costs and revenues of typical dive and trap-fishing operations. Artisanal fisheries had ranges of up to 50km, and had moved significantly offshore within the previous 10 years. At the scale of a 5 x 5 min latitude/longitude grid, trap fishing effort was highly aggregated (dispersion coefficient = 3.5), while diving had a regular dispersion (d.c. = 0.1). Descriptions of catch composition at each site showed a clear spatial pattern in the distribution of two locally recognised types of lobster, potentially indicating local stock structures. Economic information was summarised into balance sheets for typical fishers and suggested that fuel accounted for about 52 and 37% of the operating costs of dive and trap fishing captains, respectively. Qualitative questions highlighted trap theft, adoption of geographical positioning system (GPS) technology and fuel costs as major factors affecting spatial behaviour. The costs and benefits of using more distant grounds were examined by testing for relationships between stated typical catch rates and distance of 90 trap-fishing grounds and between fuel expenditure and catches in 291 daily records of the activities of 3 divers. Maximum catch rates stated by trap fishers were significantly higher at more distant sites and daily catches by divers had a positive relationship with fuel expenditure, which suggested that increasing fuel expenditure to target more distant sites would lead to higher gross revenue as well as higher net revenues, after considering variable operating costs.

While offshore cod stocks still were abundant and productive, the Swedish west coast showed signs of diminishing adult cod abundance at the beginning of the 1980s, where the local cod component was considered to be extirpated. To survey the present cod spawning activity and stock composition, we initiated egg trawling over two consecutive years (203 hauls in total) in combination with population genetic analyses (425 individually genotyped eggs). Here, we provide evidence of cod spawning at the Swedish Skagerrak coast, suggesting recolonization or that local cod has recovered from a nearly depleted state. Early stage eggs were found inside fjords too far to have been transported by oceanic drift from offshore spawning areas. The cod eggs were genetically similar in early to late life-stages and cluster mainly with the local adult cod, indicating that eggs and adults belong to the same genetic unit. The cod eggs were genetically differentiated from adult North Sea cod, and, to a lesser degree, also from the Kattegat and oresund cod, i.e. indicating a possible recovery of local coastal stock. The patterns of the genetic structure in the inshore areas are, however, difficult to fully disentangle, as Atlantic cod in the North Sea-Skagerrak area seem to be a mixture of co-existing forms: local cod completing their entire life cycle in fjords and sheltered areas, and oceanic populations showing homing behaviours. The egg abundances are considerably lower compared with what is found in similar studies along the Norwegian Skagerrak coast.

An indirect approach first interpolates individual species distributions and then determines indices based on the stacked distribution maps. We compared the appropriateness of both approaches to provide management-relevant information by mapping the distribution of demersal fish biodiversity in the German North Sea Exclusive Economic Zone using species richness, Hill's N-1 and a novel traits-based community sensitivity to fishing index (CSI).

While tactical management is still dominated by single-species models that do not explicitly account for these drivers, more holistic ecosystem models are used in strategic management. One way forward in this regard is with individual-based models (IBMs), which provide a single framework in which these drivers can be represented explicitly. We present a generic marine fish IBM that incorporates spatial and temporal variation in food availability, temperature and exploitation. Key features of the model are that it (1) includes realistic energy budgets; (2) includes the full life cycle of fish; (3) is spatially-explicit and (4) incorporates satellite remote-sensing data to represent the environmental drivers. The rates at which individuals acquire and use energy depend on local food availability and temperature. Their state variables, including life stage, size and energy reserves, are updated daily, from which population structure and dynamics emerge. To demonstrate the use of the model we calibrate it for mackerel (Scomber scombrus) in the North East Atlantic. Most parameters are taken from the literature, except the background early mortality rate and the strength predator density dependence, which were estimated by fitting the model to data using Approximate Bayesian Computation. The calibrated model successfully matches the available data on mackerel population dynamics and structure. We demonstrate the use of the model for management purposes by simulating the population effects of opening and closing a sector of the North Sea to mackerel fishing. Our model uses basic principles of behavioural and physiological ecology to establish how spatial and temporal variations in ecosystem drivers affect the individuals in the population. Population dynamics and structure are calculated from the collective effects on individuals. Application to a test case shows the method can fit available data well. Individual-based approaches such as this study have potential for use in strategic management because they can account for spatial structuring, food-web interactions, density dependence, and environmental drivers within a single framework.",English,Article,Green Accepted,Web of Science,K,CS - Western Waters,,,,,,,,,,,,Task 5.2 Predicting species distribution ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This gear has caused negative effects on the communities and topography of the seafloor. Temporal or spatial fishing closures have been proposed as strategies to reduce the disturbances caused by overfishing and for biodiversity recovery and restoration of ecosystems. The present study used various indicators to analyze and compare the differences between the demersal fish assemblages in a fishing closure area (FCA) established by the fishers of the Roses port (NW Mediterranean) and those on a fishing ground (FG) to assess the efficiency of this strategy two years after the cessation of fishing. Our findings demonstrated a noticeable increase in the abundance and biomass of all species in the FCA, especially species of small and medium size. Thus, our findings demonstrated that there were detectable shifts in the community (composition, rank abundance plots, ABC curves and diversity metrics) in a short time, evidencing slight disturbance effects on ecosystems. The present study also showed positive effects on the population structure, which had an increase in larger individuals, although the pattern varied between species. In particular, the European hake stock showed an increase in recruits, and the presence of large adults supported the suitability of this protection measure. Consequently, long time periods are not necessary to perceive noticeable benefits in terms of biodiversity recovery and ecosystem restoration in some deep marine ecosystems, and monitoring from the first year of fishing cessation is very important.

Different models have been developed to detect fishing activity from Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) data. While mathematical and statistical methods differ, all rely on the idea that vessel speed over ground provides information on fishing vessel activity. However, trawling with constant speed relative to the water mass may as well prove a winning strategy for both technical (to ensure sufficient trawl opening) and biological (to limit escapement of fish) reasons. Therefore, considering speed through water instead of speed over ground might provide insights into fishing activities. We developed a method combining surface currents derived from ocean circulation models with VMS data to estimate vessel speed through water. We then used vessel speed through water as input to two previously published segmentation methods to infer fishing activity during a fishing trip. We illustrate the approach by analysing trajectories of trawlers operating in the Eastern English Channel. All vessels were equipped with VMS and part of the Obsmer national discard sampling programme. Overall, results showed that surface currents influenced fishing behaviour, and trawling preferentially occured parallel to surface currents. Speed over ground associated with trawling behaviour was much more variable than speed through water, suggesting that trawling occured at constant engine regimes. However, for both segmentation methods using speed through water instead of speed over ground did not improve our capacity to identify trawling sequences. In both cases the amount of time spent trawling during a trip was overestimated.",English,Article,"Green Submitted, Bronze",Web of Science,EXCLUDE on lack of spatial context,,,,,,,,,,,This paper proves that speed through water is a better predictor than speed over ground to identify fishing activities,Does not provide any map or driver of the fishing activities,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results from multispecies model runs,2003,SCIENTIA MARINA,67,,315,323,10.3989/scimar.2003.67s1315,,"A conceptual temperature dependent multispecies model for stock interactions and harvesting of herring, capelin and cod in the Norwegian Sea-Barents Sea region has been developed. The concept presupposes that good recruitment of herring and cod is linked to warm ocean climate, which may occur with a frequency of 8 to 10 years. Strong herring year classes overlap the distribution of capelin larvae in 3-4 years causing mass mortality of the capelin fry, and depletion of the capelin stock. At the same time the herring is about to leave the Barents Sea, and lack of food in,subsequent years reduces the potential yield of cod. Immature cod is the main predator on mature capelin and cannibalism is an important factor in reducing the abundance of juvenile cod when the capelin stock is rebuilding. The model is used in a study of the effects of different fishery management strategies on stocks and yield. Results show that optimum yield of cod is obtained by high fishing mortality on immature cod from the end of a warm period until the spawning stock of capelin is rebuilt. This fishing strategy will result in large fluctuation in the yearly cod catches but yield an optimum average biomass production of capelin and an optimum potential catch of cod. These results are in accordance with the catch history of cod. Prior to the 1970s, the effort of the fishery in the Barents Sea followed to a large extent the abundance of immature cod, resulting in large catches when the stock was abundant. The yearly catches varied from 0.4 to 1.3 million tonnes, but the average catch obtained in the two periods 1950-1958 and 1959-1969 are the highest on record. Moreover, the trawlers fished with small meshes in the cod end, discarding considerable quantities of the smallest fish.

Both the methods available to map essential fish habitats and the usefulness of these maps are discussed in this paper. Generally, the first step to obtain maps of essential fish habitats consists in choosing one of the numerous existing statistical approaches to build robust habitat suitability models linking relevant descriptors of the marine environment to the spatial distribution of fish presence or density. When these descriptors are exhaustively known, i.e. maps are available for each of them, geo-referenced predictions from these models and their related uncertainty may be imported into Geographic Information Systems for the quantitative identification and characterization of key sites for the marine living resources. The second part of this paper deals with the usefulness of such quantitative maps for management purposes. These maps allow for the quantitative identification of the different habitats that are required for these marine resources to complete their life cycles and enable to measure their respective importance for population renewal and conservation. The consequences of anthropogenic pressures not only fishing but also land reclamation, aggregate extractions or degradation of habitat quality (e.g. nutrient excess or xenobiotics loadings, invasive species or global change) on living resources, may also be simulated from such habitat models. These quantitative maps may serve as input in specific conservation planning software based on the systematic conservation approach. Fish habitat maps thus may help decision makers to select relevant protection areas and design coherent MPA networks which objectives are to sustain fishing resources and fisheries.

A field survey was conducted over a coastal gradient comprising 300 data points sampled consistently for fish community and environmental data. Results from multivariate and univariate analyses supported each other, demonstrating that mesopredatory fish abundance at species and functional group level was positively related to the cover of structurally complex vegetation and negatively related to eutrophication, as measured by water transparency. Contrary to other studies showing an inverse relationship to piscivore abundance over time, the spatial distribution of mesopredatory fish was not locally regulated by the abundance of piscivorous fish, probably attributed to piscivores being at historically low levels due to previous overfishing. Mesopredatory fish abundance was highest in areas with high habitat quality and positively related to the abundance of piscivores, suggesting a predominance of bottom-up processes.

Micropopulation processes, such as gene flow, operating within geographic regions are often poorly understood, despite their potential to affect stock structure and sustainability. This is especially true for highly mobile species, such as elasmobranchs, where the potential for spatial overlap of regional populations is increased as a result of greater movement capabilities. A lack of information on these processes means that management plans rarely consider spatio-temporal structure. 2. Spurdog (Squalus acanthias) are globally distributed throughout temperate regions yet there is an apparent lack of gene flow between ocean basins. In the North-east Atlantic there is little work on gene flow within the region, which is currently managed as a single stock that is estimated to be at 19% compared with 1905. Some evidence from this region suggests population processes that have the potential to cause structuring. 3.

However, such effects are often not well understood, partly because they can be difficult to distinguish from impacts of environmental fluctuations. We evaluated the effects of an industrial sand lance (Ammodytes marinus) fishery off the North Sea coast of the United Kingdom, which has been opened and closed in a quasi-experimental fashion, on sand-lance-dependent breeding seabirds. Controlling for environmental variation ( sea surface temperature, abundance of larval sand lance, and size of adult sand lance), we found that, when the fishery was operating, breeding productivity in the intensively studied seabird colony on the Isle of May was significantly depressed for one surface-feeding seabird species, the Black-legged Kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), but not for four diving species. Analyzing Kittiwake data from 12 colonies inside and outside the closure zone in a replicated before-after control impact design, we again found that breeding productivity was significantly depressed in the closure zone when the fishery was active, whereas no effect was found in the control zone. Furthermore, Kittiwake breeding productivity was negatively correlated with fishery effort during the fishery period in the closure zone, but not in the control zone. The contrasting findings in the two zones could be related to environmental differences or to the fact that only one study colony in the control zone was exposed to high fishery effort within the typical foraging range of Kittiwakes during the breeding season. The strong impact on Kittiwakes, but not on diving species, could result from ( 1) inherently high sensitivity to reduced prey availability, ( 2) changes in the vertical distribution of sand lance at lower densities, ( 3) sand lance showing avoidance behavior to fishery vessels, or a combination of some or all of these factors.

A principal component analysis (PCA) using 7 biotic and abiotic parameters is applied to investigate the impact of environmental changes in the North Sea on 5 selected taxa of fish larvae during the period 1960 to 2004. The analysis revealed 4 periods of time (1960-1976; 1977-1982; 1983-1996; 1997-2004) reflecting 3 different ecosystem states. The larvae of clupeids, sandeels, dab and gadoids seemed to be affected mainly by changes in the plankton ecosystem, while the larvae of migratory species such as Atlantic mackerel responded more to hydrographic changes. Climate variability seems more likely to influence fish populations through bottom-up control via a cascading effect from changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) impacting on the hydro dynamic features of the North Sea, in turn impacting on the plankton available as prey for fish larvae. The responses and adaptability of fish larvae to changing environmental conditions, particularly to changes in prey availability, are complex and species-specific. This complexity is enhanced with fishing effects interacting with climate effects and this study supports furthering our under standing of such interactions before attempting to predict how fish populations respond to climate variability.",english,Article,,Web of Science,EXCLUDE on lack of spatial context,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most reliable way to pursue these aims could be represented by a change in the exploitation pattern, in order to guarantee the sustainability of fisheries without compromising their socioeconomic viability. In this paper, the demersal fisheries of the Ionian Sea [Geographic Sub-area (GSA) 19] were analyzed with respect to their spatial, temporal, economic, and biological characteristics in terms of four key species for fisheries, namely European hake, red mullet, giant red shrimp, and deep-water rose shrimp. Specifically, (1) a quantitative procedure was applied to break down the whole system (including small-scale fleet components) into a series of fishing grounds using input data about fishing efforts; (2) the different fleet segments were defined as a combination of main gear and fishing grounds; (3) the effort and production by fleet segment were derived according to biological samplings of commercial data (Data Collection Framework for the collection and management of fisheries data. DCF), information on localization of nursery and spawning grounds, and expert knowledge; and (4) all this information was used to feed a bioeconomic modeling tool (BEMTOOL), and to explore alternative exploitation patterns. A series of scenarios including the status quo were defined, starting from the actual management approach based on temporal fishing closure. The results showed that significant improvements in the exploitation pattern could be achieved by setting up spatial and/or temporal gear-specific bans of the fishing activity. More specifically, scenarios based on a 3-month fishing ban for trawlers are expected to provide high rebuilding of the spawning stock biomass (SSB) for all target stocks, and at the same time, result in a remarkable reduction of discards. When combined with a seasonal fishing ban for small-scale fleets equipped with nets and longlines, this approach could lead to a significant improvement in all indicators, but especially the SSB of the exploited species.",english,Article,,Web of Science,EXCLUDE on lack of spatial context,CS - Mediterranean,"10,000-50,000",five year,,quarter,Fisheries Dependent Data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,There is no spatial aspect presented in the results section_maps are provided of the area and some input parameters such as effort.

Here, various aspects of phenotypic and life-history variation of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L., brown trout Salmo trutta L., and Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (L.) are reviewed. While many strategies and tactics are commonly used by these species, there are also differences in their ecology and population dynamics that result in a variety of interesting and diverse topics that are challenging for future research. Atlantic salmon display considerable phenotypic plasticity and variability in life-history characters ranging from fully freshwater resident forms, where females can mature at approximately 10 cm in length, to anadromous populations characterised by 3-5 sea-winter (5SW) salmon. Even within simple 1SW populations, 20 or more spawning life-history types can be identified. Juveniles in freshwater can use both fluvial and lacustrine habitats for rearing, and while most smolts migrate to sea during the spring, fall migrations occur in some populations. At sea, some salmon undertake extensive oceanic migrations while other populations stay within the geographical confines of areas such as the Baltic Sea. At the other extreme are those that reside in estuaries and return to freshwater to spawn after spending only a few months at sea. The review of information on the diversity of life-history forms is related to conservation aspects associated with Atlantic salmon populations and current trends in abundance and survival. Brown trout is indigenous to Europe, North Africa and western Asia, but was introduced into at least 24 countries outside Europe and now has a world-wide distribution. It exploits both fresh and salt waters for feeding and spawning (brackish), and populations are often partially migratory. One part of the population leaves and feeds elsewhere, while another part stays as residents. In large, complex systems, the species is polymorphic with different size morphs in the various parts of the habitat. Brown trout feed close to the surface and near shore, but large individuals may move far offshore. The species exhibits ontogenetic niche shifts partly related to size and partly to developmental rate. They switch when the amount of surplus energy available for growth becomes small with fast growers being younger and smaller fish than slow growers. Brown trout is an opportunistic carnivore, but individuals specialise at least temporarily on particular food items; insect larvae are important for the young in streams, while littoral epibenthos in lakes and fish are most important for large trout. The sexes differ in resource use and size. Females are more inclined than males to become migratory and feed in pelagic waters. Males exploit running water, near-shore and surface waters more than females. Therefore, females feed more on zooplankton and exhibit a more uniform phenotype than males. The Arctic charr is the northernmost freshwater fish on earth, with a circumpolar distribution in the Holarctic that matches the last glaciation. Recent mtDNA studies indicate that there are five phylogeographic lineages (Atlantic, Arctic, Bering, Siberian and Acadian) that may be of Pleistocene origin. Phenotypic expression and ecology are more variable in charr than in most fish. Weights at maturation range from 3 g to 12 kg. Population differences in morphology and coloration are large and can have some genetic basis. Charr live in streams at sea and in all habitats of oligotrophic lakes, including very deep areas. Ontogeneti The charr feed on all major prey types of streams, lakes and near-shore marine habitats, but has high niche flexibility in competition. Cannibalism is expressed in several cases, and can be important for developing and maintaining bimodal size distributions. Anadromy is found in the northern part of its range and involves about 40, but sometimes more days in the sea. All charr overwinter in freshwater. Partial migration is common, but the degree of anadromy varies greatly among populations. The food at sea includes zooplankton and pelagic fish, but also epibenthos. Polymorphism and sympatric morphs are much studied. As a prominent fish of glaciated lakes, charr is an important species for studying ecological speciation by the combination of field studies and experiments, particularly in the fields of morphometric heterochrony and comparative behaviour.",english,Review,,Web of Science,EXCLUDE on document type,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,As indicated by the person scanning the abstracts: off topic.

This situation is unprecedented for the marine biosphere and it is essential to understand the mechanisms and pathways by which ecosystems respond. We report that climate change and overfishing are likely to be responsible for a rapid restructuring of a highly productive marine ecosystem with effects throughout the pelagos and the benthos. In the mid-1980s, climate change, consequent modifications in the North Sea plankton, and fishing, all reduced North Sea cod recruitment. In this region, production of many benthic species respond positively and immediately to temperature. Analysis of a long-term, spatially extensive biological (plankton and cod) and physical (sea surface temperature) dataset suggests that synchronous changes in cod numbers and sea temperature have established an extensive trophic cascade favoring lower trophic level groups over economic fisheries. A proliferation of jellyfish that we detect may signal the climax of these changes. This modified North Sea ecology may provide a clear indication of the synergistic consequences of coincident climate change and overfishing. The extent of the ecosystem restructuring that has occurred in the North Sea suggests we are unlikely to reverse current climate and human-induced effects through ecosystem resource management in the short term. Rather, we should understand and adapt to new ecological regimes. This implies that fisheries management policies will have to be fully integrated with the ecological consequences of climate change to prevent a similar collapse in an exploited marine ecosystem elsewhere.",english,Article,,Web of Science,EXCLUDE on lack of spatial context,CS - North Sea,">100,000",multidecadal,"10,000-50,000",year,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spatially explicit data (CPR and SST) are used to calculate annual means and this then used there after.

Effects of water temperature, size and age structure of the spawning stock, abundance of food, and timing of spawning in preceding years were studied as possible determinants of annual spawning time. During the 1970s and late 1980s, peak spawning took place between the end of April and mid-June. A remarkable shift in the timing of spawning to the end of July was observed in the 1990s. The key factors governing the timing of spawning are water temperature during the period of gonadal maturation, density-dependent processes related to the size of the spawning stock, and food availability. The age structure of the spawning stock is suggested to have an additional effect. A high proportion of first-time spawners and decreasing water temperature have caused progressively delayed spawning since the early 1990s. Late spawning involves several processes that are detrimental to the survival of the early lire stages. Recruitment in the mid-1990s was below what could be expected from spawning stock biomass and favourable hydrographic conditions. It is therefore suggested that the rebuilding of the Baltic cod stock could be improved by reduced fishing pressure in spring on early spawners.

These impacts are patchily distributed according to the spatial and temporal variation in fishing effort that results from fishers' behaviour. As a consequence, the frequency and intensity of fishing disturbance varies among different habitat types. Different fishing methodologies vary in the degree to which they affect the seabed. Structurally complex habitats (e.g. seagrass meadows, biogenic reefs) and those that are relatively undisturbed by natural perturbations (e.g. deep-water mud substrata) are more adversely affected by fishing than unconsolidated sediment habitats that occur in shallow coastal waters. These habitats also have the longest recovery trajectories in terms of the recolonization of the habitat by the associated fauna. Comparative studies of areas of the seabed that have experienced different levels of fishing activity demonstrate that chronic fishing disturbance leads to the removal of high-biomass species that are composed mostly of emergent seabed organisms. Contrary to the belief of fishers that fishing enhances seabed production and generates food for target fish species, productivity is actually lowered as fishing intensity increases and high-biomass species are removed from the benthic habitat. These organisms also increase the topographic complexity of the seabed which has been shown to provide shelter for juvenile fishes, reducing their vulnerability to predation. Conversely, scavengers and small-bodied organisms, such as polychaete worms, dominate heavily fished areas. Major changes in habitat can lead to changes in the composition of the resident fish fauna. Fishing has indirect effects on habitat through the removal of predators that control bio-engineering organisms such as algal-grazing urchins. Fishing gear resuspend the upper layers of sedimentary seabed habitats and hence remobilize contaminants and fine particulate matter into the water column. The ecological significance of these fishing effects has not yet been determined but could have implications for eutrophication and biogeochemical cycling. Simulation results suggest that the effects of low levels of trawling disturbance will be similar to those of natural bioturbators. In contrast, high levels of trawling disturbance cause sediment systems to become unstable due to large carbon fluxes between oxic and anoxic carbon compartments. In low energy habitats, intensive trawling disturbance may destabilize benthic system chemical fluxes, which has the potential to propagate more widely through the marine ecosystem. Management regimes that aim to incorporate both fisheries and habitat conservation objectives can be achieved through the appropriate use of a number of approaches, including total and partial exclusion of towed bottom fishing gears, and seasonal and rotational closure techniques. However, the inappropriate use of closed areas may displace fishing activities into habitats that are more vulnerable to disturbance than those currently trawled by fishers. In many cases, the behaviour of fishers constrains the extent of the impact of their fishing activities. Management actions that force them to redistribute their effort may be more damaging in the longer term.",English,Review,,Web of Science,EXCLUDE on lack of spatial context,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The decision to designate, implement and manage marine protected areas (MPAs) is often made ad hoc without clear guiding procedures. This study evaluates the process of establishment and management of MPAs in temperate soft-bottom marine areas, including identification of objectives, site selection, designation, implementation, ecological effectiveness and socio-economic impacts. 2. For the first time, literature about marine conservation strategies in soft-bottom temperate areas is brought together in one 'systems approach', which is visualized in a flow chart including three phases: setting policy objectives, making decisions and evaluating the eventual effects of the MPA. Policy objectives are generally easy to identify and in most cases national policy objectives are driven by international and regional legal obligations. The decision making process is the most complex phase, as the acceptance of MPAs has to be balanced against the human activities that take place in the area. 3. The relation between fisheries and MPA-management appears to be most challenging in soft-bottom temperate marine areas because of conflicting interests and institutional differences. Activities limited in space and not relying directly on ecosystem functions (e.g. offshore energy production and aggregate extraction) are generally easier to manage than fisheries. 4. The conceptual mapping exercise presented here serves as a basis for a systems approach for MPAs and has been tested for the Belgian coastal environment. In the Belgian 'MPA-process', the application of the systems approach proves to be useful in providing insight into the complex interactions of various authorities with scattered jurisdictions. 5. The unified and simplified representation of the various aspects is (1) a useful communication tool for policy makers and managers to inform other sectors and the public at large and (2) a valuable support during the 'MPA-process' that considerably enhances the prospects for Success.

The NE Atlantic mackerel population is considered to comprise three main stocks (southern, western and North Sea), with variable proportions of these three intermixing at the northerly feeding grounds.

Consequently, large-scale mackerel fishing and processing have become thriving industries in Iceland and the Faroe Islands in just a few years. The mackerel population structure in the Mediterranean Sea is less well known but seems to comprise at least one, more or less isolated, spawning component. Although mackerel is an important food resource, systematic and concerted epidemiological surveys of Anisakis species in Atlantic mackerel from European fishing grounds have been lacking. As part of the EU FP7 PARASITE project (GA no. 312068), occurrence and specific identity of Anisakis spp. from 1801 mackerel from Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean waters was investigated. In general, mackerel caught at the Atlantic fishing grounds exhibited markedly higher Anisakis spp. infection levels than fish from the Mediterranean localities. Mackerel caught off NW Spain and Portugal (ICES Wile, IXa) showed highest overall and muscular prevalence, reaching 87% and 52%, respectively, which differed significantly from all other Atlantic samples. Lowest overall Anisakis spp. prevalence and abundance was recorded in mackerel from Faroe Isles waters, while lowest muscular infection levels were found in the samples from the North Sea. Genetic nematode species identification showed that A. simplex (sensu stricto) is the dominating species in mackerel from the Atlantic areas, while A. pegreffii dominated in the samples from the Mediterranean Sea. The latter species showed generally low prevalence and intensity in the flesh, not exceeding 6% and one larva, respectively. While A. simplex (s. s.) and A. pegreffii seem to co-occur in mackerel from off NW Spain and Portugal, several A. pegreffii were also recorded in mackerel from the North- and Norwegian Seas. These findings imply that the actual mackerel started their feeding migration in waters south to the British Isles, which include parts of the sympatric area of the two sibling species.

Our findings suggest that the present management unit of a single northern stock of hake is not biologically correct, and that there is more detail in the fine-scale population structure indicating that independent population dynamics could be expected in response to fishing patterns or changing environmental conditions.",English,Article,,,K,CS - North Sea,">100,000",decade,">100,000",decade,Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey,,2,2,3,,the paper reports on the genetic structure of Merluccius merluccius in the Northeast Atlantic,Task 5.2 Predicting species distribution ,Gadus morhua,,,,,,,,,No,,,,"spatial only: distribution, mapping, static ",genetic analysis,assessment of genetic population structure using neutral and outlier SNP loci,No,"Our findings suggest that the present management unit of a single northern stock of hake is not biologically correct, and that there is more detail in the finescale population structure indicating that independent population dynamics could be expected in response to fishing patterns or changing environmental conditions."

This paper deals with video data recorded in the heads of French Mediterranean canyons. Quantitative observations were extracted from 101 video films recorded during the MEDSEACAN cruise in 2009 (Aamp/Comex). Qualitative information was extracted from four other cruises (two Marum/Comex cruises in 2009 and 2011 and two Ifremer cruises in 1995 and 2010) to support the previous observations in the Cassidaigne and Lacaze-Duthiers canyons. All the species, fishing impacts and litter recognized in the video films recorded from 180 to 700 m depth were mapped using GIS. The abundances and distributions of benthic fishing resources (marketable fishes, Aristeidae, Octopodidae), Vulnerable Marine Species, trawling scars and litter of 17 canyons were calculated and compared, as was the open slope between the Stoechades and Toulon canyons. Funiculina quadrangularis was rarely observed, being confined for the most part to the Marti canyon and, I. elongata was abundant in three canyons (Bourcart, Marti, Petit-Rhone). These two cnidarians were encountered in relatively low abundances, and it may be that they have been swept away by repeated trawling. The Lacaze-Duthiers and Cassidaigne canyons comprised the highest densities and largest colony sizes of scleractinian coldwater corals, whose distribution was mapped in detail. These colonies were often seen to be entangled in fishing lines. The alcyonacean Callogorgia verticillata was observed to be highly abundant in the Bourcart canyon and less abundant in several other canyons. This alcyonacean was also severely affected by bottom fishing gears and is proposed as a Vulnerable Marine Species. Our studies on anthropogenic impacts show that seafloor disturbance by benthic fishing is mainly attributable to trawling in the Gulf of Lion and to long lines where rocky substrates are present. The bauxite residue (red mud) expelled in the Cassidaigne canyon was seen to prevent fauna from settling at the bottom of the canyon and it covered much of the flanks. Litter was present in all of the canyons and especially in considerable quantities in the Ligurian Sea, where the heads of the canyons are closer to the coast. Three Marine Protected Areas and one fishing area with restricted access have recently been established and should permit the preservation of these deep ecosystems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

During ship transects in both years, seabird distribution, trawling activity, and hydrographic parameters (salinity, temperature, stratification/mixing, water depth, water clarity) were measured. Analysis of environmental and seabird density variables by principal component analysis revealed seven components, explaining 71% of the variance found in all variables. The most important components were: (1) a land-sea gradient combining hydrographic properties and distance to land/nearest colony; (2) trawler abundance; and (3) a factor linked to water stratification and surface temperature. Distance to colony had a significant influence on the densities of all nine breeding species considered. Flight radii differed considerably between the species. Densities in the vicinity of trawlers were particularly high in black-headed gulls (Larus ridibundus), herring gulls (L. argentatus), and great black-backed gulls (L. marinus). Black-headed gulls and herring gulls had the highest proportion of ship-followers of the total number of seabirds at sea; no ship-followers at all were found in Sandwich terns (Sterna sandvicensis), common/Arctic terns (S. hirundo/paradisaea), or guillemots (Uria aalge). Surface salinity, transparency, and thermal stratification were apparently the most important hydrographic properties, characterizing distinct water masses. Cluster analysis revealed a group of four offshore species (Fulmarus glacialis, Uria aalge, Rissa tridactyla, Larus fuscus) and seven inshore species (Larus ridibundus, L. canus, L. marinus, L. argentatus, Sterna sandvicensis, S. hirundo/paradisaea). Relations between important abiotic parameters and seabird diet are discussed.
